book the first

the creation of the [[world]] 

of bodies [[body]] chang'd to various forms, i sing: 
ye gods, from whom these [[miracles]] did spring, 
inspire my numbers with coelestial heat; 
'till i my long laborious [[work]] compleat: 
and add perpetual tenour to my rhimes, 
deduc'd from nature's birth, to caesar's times [[time]]. 
before the seas, and this terrestrial ball, 
and heav'n's high canopy, that covers all, 
one was the face of [[nature]]; if a face: 
rather a rude and indigested mass: 
a lifeless lump, unfashion'd, and unfram'd, 
of jarring seeds; and justly [[chaos]] nam'd. 
no sun was lighted up, the [[world]] to view; 
no moon did yet her blunted horns renew: 
nor yet was [[earth]] suspended in the [[sky]], 
nor pois'd, did on her own foundations lye: 
nor seas about the shores their arms had thrown; 
but [[earth]], and air, and water, were in one. 
thus air was void of [[light]], and [[earth]] unstable, 
and water's dark abyss unnavigable. 
no [[certain]] form on any was imprest; 
all were confus'd, and each disturb'd the rest. 
for hot and cold were in one [[body]] fixt; 
and soft with hard, and [[light]] with heavy mixt. 

but [[god]], or [[nature]], while they thus contend, 
to these intestine discords put an end: 
then [[earth]] from air, and seas from [[earth]] were driv'n, 
and grosser air sunk from aetherial heav'n. 
thus disembroil'd, they take their proper place; 
the next of kin, contiguously embrace; 
and foes are sunder'd, by a larger space. 
the [[force]] of [[fire]] ascended first on high, 
and took its dwelling in the vaulted [[sky]]: 
then air succeeds, in lightness next to [[fire]]; 
whose atoms from unactive [[earth]] retire. 
earth sinks beneath, and draws a num'rous throng 
of pondrous, thick, unwieldy seeds along. 
about her coasts, unruly waters roar; 
and rising, on a ridge, insult the shore. 
thus when the [[god]], whatever [[god]] was he, 
had form'd the whole, and made the parts agree, 
that no unequal portions might be found, 
he moulded [[earth]] into a spacious round: 
then with a breath, he gave the winds to blow; 
and [[bad]] the congregated waters flow. 
he adds the running springs, and standing lakes; 
and bounding banks for winding rivers makes. 
some part, in [[earth]] are swallow'd up, the most 
in ample oceans, disembogu'd, are lost. 
he shades the woods, the vallies he restrains 
with rocky mountains, and extends the plains. 

and as five zones th' aetherial regions bind, 
five, correspondent, are to [[earth]] assign'd: 
the sun with rays, directly darting down, 
fires all beneath, and fries the middle zone: 
the two beneath the distant poles, [[complain]] 
of endless winter, and perpetual rain. 
betwixt th' extreams, two happier climates hold 
the temper that partakes of hot, and cold. 
the fields of liquid air, inclosing all, 
surround the compass of this earthly ball: 
the lighter parts lye next the fires [[fire]] above; 
the grosser near the watry surface move: 
thick clouds are spread, and storms engender there, 
and thunder's voice, which wretched mortals [[fear]], 
and winds that on their wings cold winter bear. 
nor were those blustring brethren [[brother]] left at large, 
on seas, and shores, their fury to discharge: 
bound as they are, and circumscrib'd in place, 
they rend the [[world]], resistless, where they pass; 
and mighty marks of mischief leave behind; 
such is the rage of their tempestuous [[kind]]. 
first eurus to the rising morn is sent 
(the regions of the balmy continent); 
and eastern realms, where early persians run, 
to greet the blest appearance of the sun. 
westward, the wanton zephyr wings his flight; 
pleas'd with the remnants of departing [[light]]: 
fierce boreas, with his off-spring, issues forth 
t' invade the frozen waggon of the north. 
while frowning auster seeks the southern sphere; 
and rots, with endless rain, th' unwholsom year. 

high o'er the clouds, and empty realms of wind, 
the [[god]] a clearer space for heav'n design'd; 
where fields of [[light]], and liquid aether flow; 
purg'd from the pondrous dregs of [[earth]] below. 

scarce had the pow'r distinguish'd these, when streight 
the stars, no longer overlaid with weight, 
exert their heads, from underneath the mass; 
and upward shoot, and kindle as they pass, 
and with diffusive [[light]] adorn their heav'nly place. 
then, every void of [[nature]] to supply, 
with forms of gods he fills the vacant [[sky]]: 
new herds of beasts he sends, the plains to share: 
new colonies of birds, to [[people]] air: 
and to their oozy beds, the finny fish repair. 

a creature of a more exalted [[kind]] 
was wanting yet, and then was [[man]] design'd: 
conscious of [[thought]], of more capacious breast, 
for [[empire]] form'd, and fit to [[rule]] the rest: 
whether with particles of heav'nly [[fire]] 
the [[god]] of [[nature]] did his [[soul]] inspire, 
or [[earth]], but new divided from the [[sky]], 
and, pliant, still retain'd th' aetherial energy: 
which [[wise]] prometheus temper'd into paste, 
and, mixt with living streams, the godlike image cast. 

thus, while the mute creation downward bend 
their sight, and to their earthly [[mother]] tend, 
man looks aloft; and with erected [[eyes]] 
beholds his own hereditary skies [[sky]]. 
from such rude principles [[principle]] our form began; 
and [[earth]] was metamorphos'd into [[man]]. 

the golden [[age]] 

the golden [[age]] was first; when [[man]] yet new, 
no [[rule]] but uncorrupted [[reason]] knew: 
and, with a native bent, did [[good]] pursue. 
unforc'd by [[punishment]], un-aw'd by [[fear]], 
his words were simple, and his [[soul]] sincere; 
needless was written [[law]], where none opprest: 
the [[law]] of [[man]] was written in his breast: 
no suppliant crowds before the [[judge]] appear'd, 
no court erected yet, nor cause was heard: 
but all was safe, for [[conscience]] was their guard. 
the mountain-trees in distant prospect please, 
e're yet the pine descended to the seas: 
e're sails were spread, new oceans to explore: 
and [[happy]] mortals, unconcern'd for more, 
confin'd their wishes [[wish]] to their native shore. 
no walls were yet; nor fence, nor mote, nor mound, 
nor drum was heard, nor trumpet's angry sound: 
nor swords [[sword]] were forg'd; but void of [[care]] and crime, 
the soft creation slept away their [[time]]. 
the teeming [[earth]], yet guiltless of the plough, 
and unprovok'd, did fruitful stores allow: 
content with food, which [[nature]] freely bred, 
on wildings and on strawberries they fed; 
cornels and bramble-berries gave the rest, 
and falling acorns furnish'd out a feast. 
the flow'rs unsown, in fields and meadows reign'd: 
and western winds [[immortal]] spring maintain'd. 
in following years, the bearded corn ensu'd 
from [[earth]] unask'd, nor was that [[earth]] renew'd. 
from veins of vallies, milk and nectar broke; 
and honey sweating through the pores of oak. 

the silver [[age]] 

but when [[good]] saturn, banish'd from above, 
was driv'n to hell, the [[world]] was under jove. 
succeeding times [[time]] a silver [[age]] behold, 
excelling brass, but more excell'd by gold. 
then summer, autumn, winter did appear: 
and spring was but a season of the year. 
the sun his annual course obliquely made, 
good days contracted, and enlarg'd the [[bad]]. 
then air with sultry heats began to glow; 
the wings of winds were clogg'd with ice and snow; 
and shivering mortals, into houses driv'n, 
sought shelter from th' inclemency of heav'n. 
those houses, then, were caves, or homely sheds; 
with twining oziers fenc'd; and moss their beds. 
then ploughs, for seed, the fruitful furrows broke, 
and oxen labour'd first beneath the yoke. 

the brazen [[age]] 

to this came next in course, the brazen [[age]]: 
a warlike offspring, prompt to bloody rage, 
not impious yet... 

the iron [[age]] 

hard steel succeeded then: 
and stubborn as the metal, were the [[men]]. 
truth, modesty, and shame, the [[world]] forsook: 
fraud, avarice, and [[force]], their places took. 
then sails were spread, to every wind that blew. 
raw were the sailors, and the depths were new: 
trees, rudely hollow'd, did the waves sustain; 
e're ships in triumph plough'd the watry plain. 

then land-marks limited to each his [[right]]: 
for all before was [[common]] as the [[light]]. 
nor was the ground alone requir'd to bear 
her annual income to the crooked share, 
but greedy mortals, rummaging her store, 
digg'd from her entrails first the precious oar; 
which next to hell, the prudent gods had laid; 
and that alluring ill, to sight display'd. 
thus cursed steel, and more accursed gold, 
gave mischief birth, and made that mischief bold: 
and double [[death]] did wretched [[man]] invade, 
by steel assaulted, and by gold betray'd, 
now (brandish'd [[weapons]] glittering in their hands) 
mankind is broken loose from [[moral]] bands; 
no rights [[right]] of hospitality remain: 
the guest, by him who harbour'd him, is slain, 
the son-in-law pursues the father's [[life]]; 
the [[wife]] her husband murders, he the [[wife]]. 
the step-dame poyson for the [[son]] prepares; 
the [[son]] inquires into his father's years. 
faith flies, and piety in [[exile]] mourns; 
and [[justice]], here opprest, to heav'n returns. 

the giants' [[war]] 

nor were the gods themselves more safe above; 
against beleaguer'd heav'n the giants move. 
hills pil'd on hills, on mountains mountains [[lie]], 
to make their mad approaches to the skie. 
'till jove, no longer patient, took his [[time]] 
t' avenge with thunder their audacious crime: 
red light'ning plaid along the firmament, 
and their demolish'd works [[work]] to pieces rent. 
sing'd with the flames, and with the bolts transfixt, 
with native [[earth]], their [[blood]] the monsters mixt; 
the [[blood]], indu'd with animating heat, 
did in th' impregnant [[earth]] new sons [[son]] beget: 
they, like the seed from which they sprung, accurst, 
against the gods [[immortal]] [[hatred]] nurst, 
an impious, arrogant, and cruel brood; 
expressing their original from [[blood]]. 

which when the [[king]] of gods beheld from high 
(withal revolving in his memory, 
what he himself had found on [[earth]] of late, 
lycaon's guilt, and his inhumane treat), 
he sigh'd; nor longer with his [[pity]] strove; 
but kindled to a wrath becoming jove: 

then call'd a general council of the gods; 
who summon'd, issue from their blest abodes, 
and fill th' assembly with a shining train. 
a way there is, in heav'n's expanded plain, 
which, when the skies [[sky]] are clear, is seen below, 
and mortals, by the name of milky, [[know]]. 
the ground-work is of stars; through which the road 
lyes open to the thunderer's abode: 
the gods of greater nations dwell around, 
and, on the [[right]] and left, the palace bound; 
the commons [[common]] where they can: the nobler sort 
with winding-doors wide open, front the court. 
this place, as far as [[earth]] with heav'n may vie, 
i dare to call the louvre of the skie. 
when all were plac'd, in seats distinctly known, 
and he, their [[father]], had assum'd the [[throne]], 
upon his iv'ry sceptre first he leant, 
then shook his head, that shook the firmament: 
air, [[earth]], and seas, obey'd th' almighty nod; 
and, with a gen'ral [[fear]], confess'd the [[god]]. 
at length, with indignation, thus he broke 
his awful [[silence]], and the pow'rs bespoke. 

i was not more concern'd in that debate 
of [[empire]], when our universal [[state]] 
was put to hazard, and the giant [[race]] 
our captive skies [[sky]] were ready to imbrace: 
for tho' the foe was fierce, the seeds of all 
rebellion, sprung from one original; 
now, wheresoever ambient waters glide, 
all are [[corrupt]], and all must be destroy'd. 
let me this holy protestation make, 
by hell, and hell's inviolable lake, 
i try'd whatever in the godhead lay: 
but gangren'd members must be lopt away, 
before the nobler parts are tainted to decay. 
there dwells below, a [[race]] of demi-gods, 
of nymphs [[nymph]] in waters, and of fawns in woods: 
who, tho' not worthy yet, in heav'n to [[live]], 
let 'em, at least, enjoy that [[earth]] we give. 
can these be [[thought]] securely lodg'd below, 
when i my [[self]], who no superior [[know]], 
i, who have heav'n and [[earth]] at my command, 
have been attempted by lycaon's hand? 

at this a murmur through the synod went, 
and with one voice they vote his [[punishment]]. 
thus, when conspiring traytors dar'd to doom 
the fall of caesar, and in him of [[rome]], 
the nations trembled with a pious [[fear]]; 
all anxious for their earthly thunderer: 
nor was their [[care]], o caesar, less esteem'd 
by thee, than that of heav'n for jove was deem'd: 
who with his hand, and voice, did first restrain 
their murmurs, then resum'd his [[speech]] again. 
the gods to [[silence]] were compos'd, and sate 
with reverence, due to his superior [[state]]. 

cancel your pious cares [[care]]; already he 
has paid his debt to [[justice]], and to me. 
yet what his crimes, and what my judgments [[judgment]] were, 
remains for me thus briefly to declare. 
the clamours of this vile degenerate [[age]], 
the cries of orphans, and th' oppressor's rage, 
had reach'd the stars: i will descend, said i, 
in [[hope]] to prove this loud complaint a lye. 
disguis'd in humane shape, i travell'd round 
the [[world]], and more than what i heard, i found. 
o'er maenalus i took my steepy way, 
by caverns infamous for beasts of prey: 
then cross'd cyllene, and the piny shade 
more infamous, by curst lycaon made: 
dark night had cover'd [[heaven]], and [[earth]], before 
i enter'd his unhospitable door. 
just at my entrance, i display'd the sign 
that somewhat was approaching of [[divine]]. 
the prostrate [[people]] [[pray]]; the [[tyrant]] grins; 
and, adding prophanation to his sins [[sin]], 
i'll try, said he, and if a [[god]] appear, 
to prove his deity shall cost him dear. 
'twas late; the graceless wretch my [[death]] prepares, 
when i shou'd soundly sleep, opprest with cares [[care]]: 
this dire experiment he chose, to prove 
if i were mortal, or undoubted jove: 
but first he had resolv'd to taste my pow'r; 
not long before, but in a luckless hour, 
some legates, sent from the molossian [[state]], 
were on a peaceful errand come to treat: 
of these he murders one, he boils the flesh; 
and lays the mangled morsels in a dish: 
some part he roasts; then serves it up, so drest, 
and bids me welcome to this humane feast. 
mov'd with disdain, the table i o'er-turn'd; 
and with avenging flames, the palace burn'd. 
the [[tyrant]] in a fright, for shelter gains 
the neighb'ring fields, and scours along the plains. 
howling he fled, and fain he wou'd have spoke; 
but humane voice his brutal tongue forsook. 
about his lips the gather'd foam he churns, 
and, breathing slaughters, still with rage he burns, 
but on the bleating flock his fury turns. 
his mantle, now his hide, with rugged hairs 
cleaves to his back; a famish'd face he bears; 
his arms descend, his shoulders sink away 
to multiply his legs for chase of prey. 
he grows a wolf, his hoariness remains, 
and the same rage in other members reigns. 
his [[eyes]] still sparkle in a narr'wer space: 
his jaws retain the grin, and [[violence]] of his face 

this was a [[single]] ruin, but not one 
deserves so just a [[punishment]] alone. 
mankind's a monster, and th' ungodly times [[time]] 
confed'rate into guilt, are sworn to crimes. 
all are alike involv'd in ill, and all 
must by the same relentless fury fall. 
thus ended he; the greater gods assent; 
by clamours urging his severe intent; 
the less fill up the cry for [[punishment]]. 
yet still with [[pity]] they [[remember]] [[man]]; 
and mourn as much as heav'nly spirits can. 
they ask, when those were lost of humane birth, 
what he wou'd do with all this waste of [[earth]]: 
if his dispeopl'd [[world]] he would resign 
to beasts, a mute, and more ignoble line; 
neglected altars must no longer smoke, 
if none were left to [[worship]], and invoke. 
to whom the [[father]] of the gods reply'd, 
lay that unnecessary [[fear]] aside: 
mine be the [[care]], new [[people]] to provide. 
i will from wondrous principles [[principle]] ordain 
a [[race]] unlike the first, and try my [[skill]] again. 

already had he toss'd the flaming brand; 
and roll'd the thunder in his spacious hand; 
preparing to discharge on seas and [[land]]: 
but stopt, for [[fear]], thus violently driv'n, 
the sparks should catch his axle-tree of heav'n. 
remembring in the fates [[fate]], a [[time]] when [[fire]] 
shou'd to the battlements of [[heaven]] aspire, 
and all his blazing worlds [[world]] above shou'd burn; 
and all th' inferior globe to cinders turn. 
his dire artill'ry thus dismist, he bent 
his thoughts [[thought]] to some securer [[punishment]]: 
concludes to pour a watry deluge down; 
and what he durst not burn, resolves to drown. 

the northern breath, that freezes floods, he binds; 
with all the [[race]] of cloud-dispelling winds: 
the south he loos'd, who night and [[horror]] brings; 
and foggs are shaken from his flaggy wings. 
from his divided beard two streams he pours, 
his head, and rheumy [[eyes]] distill in show'rs, 
with rain his robe, and heavy mantle flow: 
and lazy mists are lowring on his brow; 
still as he swept along, with his clench'd fist 
he squeez'd the clouds, th' imprison'd clouds resist: 
the skies [[sky]], from pole to pole, with peals resound; 
and show'rs inlarg'd, come pouring on the ground. 
then, clad in colours of a various dye, 
junonian iris breeds a new supply 
to feed the clouds: impetuous rain descends; 
the bearded corn beneath the burden bends: 
defrauded clowns deplore their perish'd grain; 
and the long labours [[labour]] of the year are [[vain]]. 

nor from his patrimonial [[heaven]] alone 
is jove content to pour his vengeance down; 
aid from his [[brother]] of the seas he craves, 
to [[help]] him with auxiliary waves. 
the watry [[tyrant]] calls his brooks and floods, 
who rowl from mossie caves (their moist abodes); 
and with perpetual urns his palace fill: 
to whom in brief, he thus imparts his will. 

small exhortation needs; your pow'rs employ: 
and this [[bad]] [[world]], so jove requires, [[destroy]]. 
let loose the reins to all your watry store: 
bear down the damms, and open ev'ry door. 

the floods, by [[nature]] enemies [[enemy]] to [[land]], 
and proudly swelling with their new command, 
remove the living stones, that stopt their way, 
and gushing from their source, augment the sea. 
then, with his mace, their monarch struck the ground; 
with inward trembling [[earth]] receiv'd the wound; 
and rising streams a ready passage found. 
th' expanded waters gather on the plain: 
they float the fields, and over-top the grain; 
then rushing onwards, with a sweepy sway, 
bear flocks, and folds, and lab'ring hinds away. 
nor safe their dwellings were, for, sap'd by floods, 
their houses fell upon their houshold gods. 
the solid piles, too strongly built to fall, 
high o'er their heads, behold a watry wall: 
now seas and [[earth]] were in confusion lost; 
a [[world]] of waters, and without a coast. 

one climbs a cliff; one in his boat is born: 
and ploughs above, where late he sow'd his corn. 
others o'er chimney-tops and turrets row, 
and drop their anchors on the meads below: 
or downward driv'n, they bruise the tender vine, 
or tost aloft, are knock'd against a pine. 
and where of late the kids had cropt the grass, 
the monsters of the deep now take their place. 
insulting nereids on the cities [[city]] ride, 
and wond'ring dolphins o'er the palace glide. 
on leaves, and masts of mighty oaks they brouze; 
and their broad fins entangle in the boughs. 
the frighted wolf now swims amongst the sheep; 
the yellow lion wanders in the deep: 
his rapid [[force]] no longer helps the boar: 
the stag swims faster, than he ran before. 
the fowls, long beating on their wings in [[vain]], 
despair of [[land]], and drop into the main. 
now hills, and vales no more distinction [[know]]; 
and levell'd [[nature]] lies [[lie]] oppress'd below. 
the most of mortals perish in the flood: 
the small remainder dies for want of food. 

a mountain of stupendous height there stands 
betwixt th' athenian and boeotian lands [[land]], 
the bound of fruitful fields, while fields they were, 
but then a field of waters did appear: 
parnassus is its name; whose forky rise 
mounts thro' the clouds, and mates the lofty skies [[sky]]. 
high on the summit of this dubious cliff, 
deucalion wafting, moor'd his little skiff. 
he with his [[wife]] were only left behind 
of perish'd [[man]]; they two were [[human]] [[kind]]. 
the mountain nymphs [[nymph]], and themis they adore, 
and from her oracles relief implore. 
the most upright of mortal [[men]] was he; 
the most sincere, and holy woman, she. 

when [[jupiter]], surveying [[earth]] from high, 
beheld it in a lake of water [[lie]], 
that where so many millions lately liv'd, 
but two, the [[best]] of either [[sex]], surviv'd; 
he loos'd the northern wind; fierce boreas flies 
to puff away the clouds, and purge the skies [[sky]]: 
serenely, while he blows, the vapours driv'n, 
discover heav'n to [[earth]], and [[earth]] to heav'n. 
the billows fall, while [[neptune]] lays his mace 
on the rough sea, and smooths its furrow'd face. 
already triton, at his call, appears 
above the waves; a tyrian robe he wears; 
and in his hand a crooked trumpet bears. 
the soveraign bids him peaceful sounds inspire, 
and give the waves the signal to retire. 
his writhen shell he takes; whose narrow vent 
grows by degrees [[degree]] into a large extent, 
then gives it breath; the blast with doubling sound, 
runs the wide circuit of the [[world]] around: 
the sun first heard it, in his early east, 
and met the rattling ecchos in the west. 
the waters, listning to the trumpet's roar, 
obey the summons, and forsake the shore. 

a thin circumference of [[land]] appears; 
and [[earth]], but not at once, her visage rears, 
and peeps upon the seas from upper grounds; 
the streams, but just contain'd within their bounds, 
by slow degrees [[degree]] into their channels crawl; 
and [[earth]] increases, as the waters fall. 
in longer [[time]] the tops of trees appear, 
which mud on their dishonour'd branches bear. 

at length the [[world]] was all restor'd to view; 
but desolate, and of a sickly hue: 
nature beheld her [[self]], and stood aghast, 
a dismal desart, and a silent waste. 

which when deucalion, with a piteous look 
beheld, he wept, and thus to pyrrha spoke: 
oh [[wife]], oh sister, oh of all thy [[kind]] 
the [[best]], and only creature left behind, 
by kindred, [[love]], and now by dangers joyn'd; 
of multitudes, who breath'd the [[common]] air, 
we two remain; a [[species]] in a pair: 
the rest the seas have swallow'd; nor have we 
ev'n of this wretched [[life]] a certainty. 
the clouds are still above; and, while i speak, 
a second deluge o'er our heads may break. 
shou'd i be snatcht from hence, and thou remain, 
without relief, or partner of thy [[pain]], 
how cou'dst thou such a wretched [[life]] sustain? 
shou'd i be left, and thou be lost, the sea 
that bury'd her i lov'd, shou'd bury me. 
oh cou'd our [[father]] his old [[arts]] inspire, 
and make me heir of his informing [[fire]], 
that so i might abolisht [[man]] retrieve, 
and perisht [[people]] in new souls [[soul]] might [[live]]. 
but heav'n is pleas'd, nor ought we to [[complain]], 
that we, th' examples [[example]] of [[mankind]], remain. 
he said; the careful couple joyn their tears: 
and then invoke the gods, with pious prayers. 
thus, in devotion having eas'd their [[grief]], 
from [[sacred]] oracles they seek relief; 
and to cephysus' brook their way pursue: 
the stream was troubled, but the ford they knew; 
with living waters, in the fountain bred, 
they sprinkle first their garments, and their head, 
then took the way, which to the temple [[led]]. 
the roofs were all defil'd with moss, and mire, 
the desart altars void of solemn [[fire]]. 
before the gradual, prostrate they ador'd; 
the pavement kiss'd; and thus the saint implor'd. 

o righteous themis, if the pow'rs above 
by pray'rs are bent to [[pity]], and to [[love]]; 
if humane miseries can move their [[mind]]; 
if yet they can [[forgive]], and yet be [[kind]]; 
tell how we may restore, by second birth, 
mankind, and [[people]] desolated [[earth]]. 
then thus the gracious [[goddess]], nodding, said; 
depart, and with your vestments veil your head: 
and stooping lowly down, with losen'd zones, 
throw each behind your backs, your mighty mother's bones.

amaz'd the pair, and mute with wonder stand, 
'till pyrrha first refus'd the dire command. 
forbid it heav'n, said she, that i shou'd tear 
those holy reliques from the sepulcher. 
they ponder'd the mysterious words again, 
for some new sense; and long they sought in [[vain]]: 
at length deucalion clear'd his cloudy brow, 
and said, the dark aenigma will allow 
a meaning, which, if well i [[understand]], 
from sacrilege will [[free]] the god's command: 
this [[earth]] our mighty [[mother]] is, the stones 
in her capacious [[body]], are her bones: 
these we must cast behind. with [[hope]], and [[fear]], 
the woman did the new solution hear: 
the [[man]] diffides in his own augury, 
and doubts [[doubt]] the gods; yet both resolve to try. 
descending from the mount, they first unbind 
their vests, and veil'd, they cast the stones behind: 
the stones (a miracle to mortal view, 
but long tradition makes it pass for true) 
did first the rigour of their [[kind]] expel, 
and suppled into softness, as they fell; 
then swell'd, and swelling, by degrees [[degree]] grew warm; 
and took the rudiments of [[human]] form. 
imperfect shapes: in marble such are seen, 
when the rude chizzel does the [[man]] begin; 
while yet the roughness of the stone remains, 
without the rising muscles, and the veins. 
the sappy parts, and next resembling juice, 
were turn'd to moisture, for the body's use: 
supplying humours [[humour]], [[blood]], and nourishment; 
the rest, too solid to receive a bent, 
converts to bones; and what was once a vein, 
its former name and [[nature]] did retain. 
by [[help]] of pow'r [[divine]], in little space, 
what the [[man]] threw, assum'd a manly face; 
and what the [[wife]], renew'd the female [[race]]. 
hence we derive our [[nature]]; born to bear 
laborious [[life]]; and harden'd into [[care]]. 

the rest of animals, from teeming [[earth]] 
produc'd, in various forms receiv'd their birth. 
the native moisture, in its close retreat, 
digested by the sun's aetherial heat, 
as in a kindly womb, began to breed: 
then swell'd, and quicken'd by the vital seed. 
and some in less, and some in longer space, 
were ripen'd into form, and took a sev'ral face. 
thus when the nile from pharian fields is fled, 
and seeks, with ebbing tides, his ancient bed, 
the fat manure with heav'nly [[fire]] is warm'd; 
and crusted creatures, as in wombs, are form'd; 
these, when they turn the glebe, the peasants find; 
some rude, and yet unfinish'd in their [[kind]]: 
short of their limbs, a lame imperfect birth: 
one half alive; and one of lifeless [[earth]]. 

for heat, and moisture, when in bodies [[body]] join'd, 
the temper that results from either [[kind]] 
conception makes; and fighting 'till they mix, 
their mingled atoms in each other fix. 
thus nature's hand the genial bed prepares 
with friendly discord, and with fruitful wars [[war]]. 

from hence the surface of the ground, with mud 
and slime besmear'd (the faeces of the flood), 
receiv'd the rays of heav'n: and sucking in 
the seeds of heat, new creatures did begin: 
some were of sev'ral sorts produc'd before, 
but of new monsters, [[earth]] created more. 
unwillingly, but yet she brought to [[light]] 
thee, python too, the wondring [[world]] to fright, 
and the new nations, with so dire a sight: 
so monstrous was his bulk, so large a space 
did his vast [[body]], and long train embrace. 
whom phoebus basking on a bank espy'd; 
e're now the [[god]] his arrows had not try'd 
but on the trembling deer, or mountain goat; 
at this new quarry he prepares to shoot. 
though ev'ry shaft took place, he spent the store 
of his full quiver; and 'twas long before 
th' expiring serpent wallow'd in his gore. 
then, to preserve the fame of such a deed, 
for python slain, he pythian games decred. 
where [[noble]] youths [[youth]] for mastership shou'd strive, 
to quoit, to run, and steeds, and chariots drive. 
the prize was fame: in witness of renown 
an oaken garland did the victor [[crown]]. 
the laurel was not yet for triumphs born; 
but every green alike by phoebus worn, 
did, with promiscuous grace, his flowing locks adorn. 

the transformation of daphne into a lawrel 

the first and fairest of his loves [[love]], was she 
whom not blind [[fortune]], but the dire decree 
of angry cupid forc'd him to [[desire]]: 
daphne her name, and peneus was her sire. 
swell'd with the [[pride]], that new [[success]] attends, 
he sees the stripling, while his bow he bends, 
and thus insults him: thou lascivious boy, 
are arms like these for [[children]] to employ? 
know, such atchievements are my proper claim; 
due to my vigour, and unerring aim: 
resistless are my shafts, and python late 
in such a feather'd [[death]], has found his [[fate]]. 
take up the torch (and lay my [[weapons]] by), 
with that the feeble souls [[soul]] of lovers fry. 
to whom the [[son]] of [[venus]] thus reply'd, 
phoebus, thy shafts are sure on all beside, 
but mine of phoebus, mine the fame shall be 
of all thy conquests, when i conquer thee. 

he said, and soaring, swiftly wing'd his flight: 
nor stopt but on parnassus' airy height. 
two diff'rent shafts he from his quiver draws; 
one to repel [[desire]], and one to cause. 
one shaft is pointed with refulgent gold: 
to bribe the [[love]], and make the lover bold: 
one blunt, and tipt with lead, whose base allay 
provokes disdain, and drives [[desire]] away. 
the blunted bolt against the [[nymph]] he drest: 
but with the sharp transfixt apollo's breast. 

th' enamour'd deity pursues the chace; 
the scornful damsel shuns his loath'd embrace: 
in hunting beasts of prey, her [[youth]] employs; 
and phoebe rivals in her rural joys. 
with naked neck she goes, and shoulders bare; 
and with a fillet binds her flowing hair. 
by many suitors sought, she mocks their pains [[pain]], 
and still her vow'd virginity maintains. 
impatient of a yoke, the name of bride 
she shuns, and hates the joys, she never try'd. 
on wilds, and woods, she fixes her [[desire]]: 
nor knows [[know]] what [[youth]], and kindly [[love]], inspire. 
her [[father]] chides her oft: thou ow'st, says he, 
a husband to thy [[self]], a [[son]] to me. 
she, like a crime, abhors the nuptial bed: 
she glows with blushes, and she hangs her head. 
then casting round his neck her tender arms, 
sooths him with blandishments, and filial charms: 
give me, my [[lord]], she said, to [[live]], and [[die]], 
a spotless maid, without the [[marriage]] tye. 
'tis but a small request; i beg no more 
than what diana's [[father]] gave before. 
the [[good]] old sire was soften'd to [[consent]]; 
but said her [[wish]] wou'd prove her [[punishment]]: 
for so much [[youth]], and so much [[beauty]] join'd, 
oppos'd the [[state]], which her desires [[desire]] design'd. 

the [[god]] of [[light]], aspiring to her bed, 
hopes what he seeks, with flattering fancies fed; 
and is, by his own oracles, mis-led. 
and as in empty fields the stubble burns, 
or nightly travellers, when day returns, 
their useless torches on dry hedges throw, 
that catch the flames, and kindle all the row; 
so burns the [[god]], consuming in [[desire]], 
and feeding in his breast a fruitless [[fire]]: 
her well-turn'd neck he view'd (her neck was bare) 
and on her shoulders her dishevel'd hair; 
oh were it comb'd, said he, with what a grace 
wou'd every waving curl become her face! 
he view'd her [[eyes]], like heav'nly lamps that shone, 
he view'd her lips, too sweet to view alone, 
her taper fingers, and her panting breast; 
he praises [[praise]] all he sees, and for the rest 
believes the beauties [[beauty]] yet unseen are [[best]]: 
swift as the wind, the damsel fled away, 
nor did for these alluring speeches [[speech]] stay: 
stay [[nymph]], he cry'd, i [[follow]], not a foe. 
thus from the lyon trips the trembling doe; 
thus from the wolf the frighten'd lamb removes, 
and, from pursuing faulcons, fearful doves; 
thou shunn'st a [[god]], and shunn'st a [[god]], that loves [[love]]. 
ah, lest some thorn shou'd pierce thy tender foot, 
or thou shou'dst fall in flying my pursuit! 
to sharp uneven ways thy steps decline; 
abate thy speed, and i will bate of mine. 
yet [[think]] from whom thou dost so rashly fly; 
nor basely born, nor shepherd's swain am i. 
perhaps thou know'st not my superior [[state]]; 
and from that ignorance proceeds thy hate. 
me claros, delphi, tenedos obey; 
these hands the patareian scepter sway. 
the [[king]] of gods begot me: what shall be, 
or is, or ever was, in [[fate]], i see. 
mine is th' invention of the charming lyre; 
sweet notes, and heav'nly numbers, i inspire. 
sure is my bow, unerring is my dart; 
but ah! more deadly his, who pierc'd my [[heart]]. 
med'cine is mine; what herbs and simples grow 
in fields, and forrests, all their pow'rs i [[know]]; 
and am the [[great]] physician call'd, below. 
alas that fields and forrests can afford. 
no remedies to heal their love-sick lord! 
to cure the pains [[pain]] of [[love]], no plant avails: 
and his own physick, the physician falls. 

she heard not half; so furiously she flies; 
and on her ear th' imperfect accent dies, 
fear gave her wings; and as she fled, the wind 
increasing, spread her flowing hair behind; 
and left her legs and thighs expos'd to view: 
which made the [[god]] more eager to pursue. 
the [[god]] was [[young]], and was too hotly bent 
to lose his [[time]] in empty compliment: 
but [[led]] by [[love]], and fir'd with such a sight, 
impetuously pursu'd his near delight. 

as when th' impatient greyhound slipt from far, 
bounds o'er the glebe to course the fearful hare, 
she in her speed does all her safety lay; 
and he with double speed pursues the prey; 
o'er-runs her at the sitting turn, and licks 
his chaps in [[vain]], and blows upon the flix: 
she scapes, and for the neighb'ring covert strives, 
and gaining shelter, doubts [[doubt]] if yet she lives [[life]]: 
if little things with [[great]] we may compare, 
such was the [[god]], and such the flying [[fair]], 
she urg'd by [[fear]], her feet did swiftly move, 
but he more swiftly, who was urg'd by [[love]]. 
he gathers ground upon her in the chace: 
now breathes upon her hair, with nearer pace; 
and just is fast'ning on the wish'd embrace. 
the [[nymph]] grew pale, and in a mortal fright, 
spent with the [[labour]] of so long a flight; 
and now despairing, cast a mournful look 
upon the streams of her paternal brook; 
oh [[help]], she cry'd, in this extreamest need! 
if water gods are deities indeed: 
gape [[earth]], and this unhappy wretch intomb; 
or [[change]] my form, whence all my sorrows [[sorrow]] come. 
scarce had she finish'd, when her feet she found 
benumb'd with cold, and fasten'd to the ground: 
a filmy rind about her [[body]] grows; 
her hair to leaves, her arms extend to boughs: 
the [[nymph]] is all into a lawrel gone; 
the smoothness of her skin remains alone. 
yet phoebus loves [[love]] her still, and casting round 
her bole, his arms, some little warmth he found. 
the tree still panted in th' unfinish'd part: 
not wholly vegetive, and heav'd her [[heart]]. 
he fixt his lips upon the trembling rind; 
it swerv'd aside, and his embrace declin'd. 
to whom the [[god]], because thou canst not be 
my mistress, i espouse thee for my tree: 
be thou the prize of [[honour]], and renown; 
the deathless poet, and the poem, [[crown]]. 
thou shalt the roman festivals adorn, 
and, after poets, be by victors worn. 
thou shalt returning caesar's triumph grace; 
when pomps shall in a long procession pass. 
wreath'd on the posts before his palace wait; 
and be the [[sacred]] guardian of the gate. 
secure from thunder, and unharm'd by jove, 
unfading as th' [[immortal]] pow'rs above: 
and as the locks of phoebus are unshorn, 
so shall perpetual green thy boughs adorn. 
the grateful tree was pleas'd with what he said; 
and shook the shady honours [[honour]] of her head. 

the transformation of io into a heyfer 

an ancient forest in thessalia grows; 
which tempe's pleasing valley does inclose: 
through this the rapid peneus take his course; 
from pindus rolling with impetuous [[force]]; 
mists from the river's mighty fall arise: 
and deadly damps inclose the cloudy skies [[sky]]: 
perpetual fogs are hanging o'er the wood; 
and sounds of waters deaf the neighbourhood. 
deep, in a rocky cave, he makes abode 
(a mansion proper for a mourning god). 
here he gives audience; issuing out decrees 
to rivers, his dependant deities. 
on this [[occasion]] hither they resort; 
to [[pay]] their homage, and to make their court. 
all doubtful, whether to congratulate 
his daughter's [[honour]], or lament her [[fate]]. 
sperchaeus, crown'd with poplar, first appears; 
then old apidanus came crown'd with years: 
enipeus turbulent, amphrysos tame; 
and aeas [[last]] with lagging waters came. 
then, of his kindred brooks, a num'rous throng 
condole his loss; and bring their urns along. 
not one was wanting of the wat'ry train, 
that fill'd his flood, or mingled with the main: 
but inachus, who in his cave, alone, 
wept not another's losses, but his own, 
for his dear io, whether stray'd, or [[dead]], 
to him uncertain, doubtful tears he shed. 
he sought her through the [[world]]; but sought in [[vain]]; 
and no where finding, rather fear'd her slain. 

her, just returning from her father's brook, 
jove had beheld, with a desiring look: 
and, oh [[fair]] [[daughter]] of the flood, he said, 
worthy alone of jove's imperial bed, 
happy whoever shall those charms possess; 
the [[king]] of gods (nor is thy lover less) 
invites thee to yon cooler shades; to shun 
the scorching rays of the meridian sun. 
nor shalt thou tempt the dangers of the grove 
alone, without a guide; thy guide is jove. 
no puny pow'r, but he whose high command 
is unconfin'd, who rules [[rule]] the seas and [[land]]; 
and tempers thunder in his awful hand, 
oh fly not: for she fled from his embrace 
o'er lerna's pastures: he pursu'd the chace 
along the shades of the lyrcaean plain; 
at length the [[god]], who never asks in [[vain]], 
involv'd with vapours, imitating night, 
both air, and [[earth]]; and then suppress'd her flight, 
and mingling [[force]] with [[love]], enjoy'd the full delight. 
mean-time the [[jealous]] juno, from on high, 
survey'd the fruitful fields of arcady; 
and wonder'd that the mist shou'd over-run 
the face of day-light, and obscure the sun. 
no nat'ral cause she found, from brooks, or bogs, 
or marshy lowlands, to [[produce]] the fogs; 
then round the skies [[sky]] she sought for [[jupiter]], 
her faithless husband; but no jove was there: 
suspecting now the worst, or i, she said, 
am much mistaken, or am much betray'd. 
with fury she precipitates her flight: 
dispels the shadows of dissembled night; 
and to the day restores his native [[light]]. 
th' almighty leacher, careful to prevent 
the consequence, foreseeing her descent, 
transforms his mistress in a trice; and now 
in io's place appears a lovely cow. 
so sleek her skin, so faultless was her make, 
ev'n juno did unwilling [[pleasure]] take 
to see so [[fair]] a rival of her [[love]]; 
and what she was, and whence, enquir'd of jove: 
of what [[fair]] herd, and from what pedigree? 
the [[god]], half caught, was forc'd upon a lye: 
and said she sprung from [[earth]]. she took the word, 
and begg'd the beauteous heyfer of her [[lord]]. 
what should he do? 'twas [[equal]] shame to jove 
or to relinquish, or betray his [[love]]: 
yet to refuse so slight a gift, wou'd be 
but more t' increase his consort's jealousie: 
thus [[fear]], and [[love]], by turns, his [[heart]] assail'd; 
and stronger [[love]] had sure, at length, prevail'd: 
but some faint [[hope]] remain'd, his [[jealous]] queen 
had not the mistress through the heyfer seen. 
the cautious [[goddess]], of her gift possest, 
yet harbour'd anxious thoughts [[thought]] within her breast; 
as she who knew the falshood of her jove; 
and justly fear'd some new relapse of [[love]]. 
which to prevent, and to secure her [[care]], 
to trusty argus she commits the [[fair]]. 

the head of argus (as with stars the skies) 
was compass'd round, and wore an hundred [[eyes]]. 
but two by turns their lids in slumber steep; 
the rest on [[duty]] still their station keep; 
nor cou'd the total constellation sleep. 
thus, ever [[present]], to his [[eyes]], and [[mind]], 
his charge was still before him, tho' behind. 
in fields he suffer'd her to feed by day, 
but when the setting sun to night gave way, 
the captive cow he summon'd with a call; 
and drove her back, and ty'd her to the stall. 
on leaves of trees, and bitter herbs she fed, 
heav'n was her canopy, bare [[earth]] her bed: 
so hardly lodg'd, and to digest her food, 
she drank from troubled streams, defil'd with mud. 
her woeful story fain she wou'd have told, 
with hands upheld, but had no hands to hold. 
her head to her ungentle keeper bow'd, 
she strove to speak, she spoke not, but she low'd: 
affrighted with the noise, she look'd around, 
and seem'd t' inquire the author of the sound. 

once on the banks where often she had play'd 
(her father's banks), she came, and there survey'd 
her alter'd visage, and her branching head; 
and starting, from her [[self]] she wou'd have fled. 
her fellow nymphs [[nymph]], familiar to her [[eyes]], 
beheld, but knew her not in this [[disguise]]. 
ev'n inachus himself was ignorant; 
and in his [[daughter]], did his [[daughter]] want. 
she follow'd where her fellows went, as she 
were still a partner of the company: 
they stroak her neck; the gentle heyfer stands, 
and her neck offers to their stroaking hands. 
her [[father]] gave her grass; the grass she took; 
and lick'd his palms, and cast a piteous look; 
and in the [[language]] of her [[eyes]], she spoke. 
she wou'd have told her name, and ask'd relief, 
but wanting words, in tears she tells her [[grief]]. 
which, with her foot she makes him [[understand]]; 
and prints the name of io in the sand. 

ah wretched me! her mournful [[father]] cry'd; 
she, with a sigh, to wretched me reply'd: 
about her milk-white neck, his arms he threw; 
and wept, and then these tender words ensue. 
and art [[arts]] thou she, whom i have sought around 
the [[world]], and have at length so sadly found? 
so found, is worse than lost: with mutual words 
thou answer'st not, no voice thy tongue affords: 
but sighs are deeply drawn from out thy breast; 
and [[speech]] deny'd, by lowing is express'd. 
unknowing, i prepar'd thy bridal bed; 
with empty hopes [[hope]] of [[happy]] issue fed. 
but now the husband of a herd must be 
thy mate, and bell'wing sons [[son]] thy progeny. 
oh, were i mortal, [[death]] might bring relief: 
but now my god-head but extends my [[grief]]: 
prolongs my woes, of which no end i see, 
and makes me curse my immortality! 
more had he said, but fearful of her stay, 
the starry guardian drove his charge away, 
to some fresh pasture; on a hilly height 
he sate himself, and kept her still in sight. 

the [[eyes]] of argus transform'd into a peacock's train 

now jove no longer cou'd her suff'rings bear; 
but call'd in haste his airy messenger, 
the [[son]] of maia, with severe decree 
to kill the keeper, and to set her [[free]]. 
with all his harness soon the [[god]] was sped, 
his flying hat was fastned on his head, 
wings on his heels were hung, and in his hand 
he holds the vertue of the snaky wand. 
the liquid air his moving pinions wound, 
and, in the moment, shoot him on the ground. 
before he came in sight, the crafty [[god]] 
his wings dismiss'd, but still retain'd his rod: 
that sleep-procuring wand [[wise]] hermes took, 
but made it seem to sight a sherpherd's hook. 
with this, he did a herd of goats controul; 
which by the way he met, and slily stole. 
clad like a [[country]] swain, he pip'd, and sung; 
and playing, drove his jolly troop along. 

with [[pleasure]], argus the musician heeds; 
but wonders much at those new vocal reeds. 
and whosoe'er thou art [[arts]], my friend, said he, 
up hither drive thy goats, and play by me: 
this hill has browz for them, and shade for thee. 
the [[god]], who was with ease induc'd to climb, 
began discourse to pass away the [[time]]; 
and still betwixt, his tuneful pipe he plies; 
and watch'd his hour, to close the keeper's [[eyes]]. 
with much ado, he partly kept awake; 
not suff'ring all his [[eyes]] repose to take: 
and ask'd the stranger, who did reeds invent, 
and whence began so rare an instrument? 

the transformation of syrinx into reeds 

then hermes thus: a [[nymph]] of late there was 
whose heav'nly form her fellows did surpass. 
the [[pride]] and joy of [[fair]] arcadia's plains, 
belov'd by deities, ador'd by swains: 
syrinx her name, by sylvans oft pursu'd, 
as oft she did the lustful gods delude: 
the rural, and the woodland pow'rs disdain'd; 
with cynthia hunted, and her rites maintain'd: 
like phoebe clad, even phoebe's [[self]] she seems, 
so tall, so streight, such well-proportion'd limbs: 
the nicest eye did no distinction [[know]], 
but that the [[goddess]] bore a golden bow: 
distinguish'd thus, the sight she cheated too. 
descending from lycaeus, pan admires 
the matchless [[nymph]], and burns with new desires [[desire]]. 
a [[crown]] of pine upon his head he wore; 
and thus began her [[pity]] to implore. 
but e'er he thus began, she took her flight 
so swift, she was already out of sight. 
nor stay'd to hear the courtship of the [[god]]; 
but bent her course to ladon's gentle flood: 
there by the river stopt, and tir'd before; 
relief from water nymphs [[nymph]] her pray'rs implore. 

now while the lustful [[god]], with speedy pace, 
just [[thought]] to strain her in a strict embrace, 
he fill'd his arms with reeds, new rising on the place. 
and while he sighs, his ill [[success]] to find, 
the tender canes were shaken by the wind; 
and breath'd a mournful air, unheard before; 
that much surprizing pan, yet pleas'd him more. 
admiring this new musick, thou, he said, 
who canst not be the partner of my bed, 
at least shall be the confort of my [[mind]]: 
and often, often to my lips be joyn'd. 
he form'd the reeds, proportion'd as they are, 
unequal in their length, and wax'd with [[care]], 
they still retain the name of his ungrateful [[fair]]. 

while hermes pip'd, and sung, and told his tale, 
the keeper's winking [[eyes]] began to fail, 
and drowsie slumber on the lids to creep; 
'till all the watchman was at length asleep. 
then soon the [[god]] his voice, and [[song]] supprest; 
and with his pow'rful rod confirm'd his rest: 
without delay his crooked faulchion drew, 
and at one fatal stroke the keeper slew. 
down from the rock fell the dissever'd head, 
opening its [[eyes]] in [[death]]; and falling, bled; 
and mark'd the passage with a crimson trail: 
thus argus lies [[lie]] in pieces, cold, and pale; 
and all his hundred [[eyes]], with all their [[light]], 
are clos'd at once, in one perpetual night. 
these juno takes, that they no more may fail, 
and spreads them in her peacock's gaudy tail. 

impatient to [[revenge]] her injur'd bed, 
she wreaks her anger on her rival's head; 
with furies frights her from her native [[home]]; 
and drives her gadding, round the [[world]] to roam: 
nor ceas'd her madness, and her flight, before 
she touch'd the limits of the pharian shore. 
at length, arriving on the banks of nile, 
wearied with length of ways, and worn with toil, 
she laid her down; and leaning on her knees, 
invok'd the cause of all her miseries: 
and cast her languishing regards above, 
for [[help]] from heav'n, and her ungrateful jove. 
she sigh'd, she wept, she low'd; 'twas all she cou'd; 
and with unkindness seem'd to tax the [[god]]. 
last, with an humble pray'r, she beg'd repose, 
or [[death]] at least, to finish all her woes. 
jove heard her vows, and with a flatt'ring look, 
in her behalf to [[jealous]] juno spoke, 
he cast his arms about her neck, and said, 
dame, rest secure; no more thy nuptial bed 
this [[nymph]] shall violate; by styx i swear, 
and every oath that binds the thunderer. 
the [[goddess]] was appeas'd; and at the word 
was io to her former shape restor'd. 
the rugged hair began to fall away; 
the sweetness of her [[eyes]] did only stay, 
tho' not so large; her crooked horns decrease; 
the wideness of her jaws and nostrils cease: 
her hoofs to hands return, in little space: 
the five long taper fingers take their place, 
and nothing of the heyfer now is seen, 
beside the native whiteness of the skin. 
erected on her feet she walks again: 
and two the [[duty]] of the four sustain. 
she tries her tongue; her [[silence]] softly breaks, 
and fears [[fear]] her former lowings when she speaks: 
a [[goddess]] now, through all th' aegyptian [[state]]: 
and serv'd by priests [[priest]], who in [[white]] linnen wait. 

her [[son]] was epaphus, at length believ'd 
the [[son]] of jove, and as a [[god]] receiv'd; 
with [[sacrifice]] ador'd, and publick pray'rs, 
he [[common]] temples with his [[mother]] shares. 
equal in years, and rival in renown 
with epaphus, the youthful phaeton 
like [[honour]] claims; and boasts his sire the sun. 
his haughty looks, and his assuming air, 
the [[son]] of isis could no longer bear: 
thou tak'st thy mother's word too far, said he, 
and hast usurp'd thy boasted pedigree. 
go, base pretender to a borrow'd name. 
thus tax'd, he blush'd with anger, and with shame; 
but shame repress'd his rage: the daunted [[youth]] 
soon seeks his [[mother]], and enquires the [[truth]]: 
mother, said he, this infamy was thrown 
by epaphus on you, and me your [[son]]. 
he spoke in publick, told it to my face; 
nor durst i vindicate the dire disgrace: 
even i, the bold, the sensible of [[wrong]], 
restrain'd by shame, was forc'd to hold my tongue. 
to hear an open slander, is a curse: 
but not to find an [[answer]], is a worse. 
if i am heav'n-begot, assert your [[son]] 
by some sure sign; and make my [[father]] known, 
to [[right]] my [[honour]], and redeem your own. 
he said, and saying cast his arms about 
her neck, and beg'd her to resolve the [[doubt]]. 

'tis hard to [[judge]] if clymene were mov'd 
more by his pray'r, whom she so dearly lov'd, 
or more with fury fir'd, to find her name 
traduc'd, and made the [[sport]] of [[common]] fame. 
she stretch'd her arms to heav'n, and fix'd her [[eyes]] 
on that [[fair]] planet that adorns the skies [[sky]]; 
now by those beams, said she, whose holy fires [[fire]] 
consume my breast, and kindle my desires [[desire]]; 
by him, who sees us both, and clears our sight, 
by him, the publick minister of [[light]], 
i swear that sun begot thee; if i lye, 
let him his chearful influence deny: 
let him no more this perjur'd creature see; 
and shine on all the [[world]] but only me. 
if still you [[doubt]] your mother's innocence, 
his eastern mansion is not far from hence; 
with little pains [[pain]] you to his leve go, 
and from himself your parentage may [[know]]. 
with joy th' ambitious [[youth]] his [[mother]] heard, 
and eager, for the [[journey]] soon prepar'd. 
he longs the [[world]] beneath him to survey; 
to guide the chariot; and to give the day: 
from meroe's burning sands he bends his course, 
nor less in [[india]] feels [[feel]] his father's [[force]]: 
his travel urging, till he came in sight; 
and saw the palace by the purple [[light]]. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book the second

the story of phaeton 

the sun's bright palace, on high columns rais'd, 
with burnish'd gold and flaming jewels blaz'd; 
the folding gates diffus'd a silver [[light]], 
and with a milder gleam refresh'd the sight; 
of polish'd iv'ry was the cov'ring wrought: 
the matter vied not with the sculptor's [[thought]], 
for in the portal was display'd on high 
(the [[work]] of vulcan) a fictitious [[sky]]; 
a waving sea th' inferiour [[earth]] embrac'd, 
and gods and goddesses [[goddess]] the waters grac'd. 
aegeon here a mighty whale bestrode; 
triton, and proteus (the deceiving god) 
with doris here were carv'd, and all her train, 
some loosely swimming in the figur'd main, 
while some on rocks their dropping hair divide, 
and some on fishes through the waters glide: 
tho' various features did the sisters grace, 
a sister's likeness was in ev'ry face. 
on [[earth]] a diff'rent landskip courts the [[eyes]], 
men, towns, and beasts in distant prospects rise, 
and nymphs [[nymph]], and streams, and woods, and rural deities. 
o'er all, the heav'n's refulgent image shines; 
on either gate were six engraven signs. 

here phaeton still gaining on th' ascent, 
to his suspected father's palace went, 
'till pressing forward through the bright abode, 
he saw at distance the illustrious [[god]]: 
he saw at distance, or the dazling [[light]] 
had flash'd too strongly on his aking sight. 

the [[god]] sits high, exalted on a [[throne]] 
of blazing gems, with purple garments on; 
the hours, in order rang'd on either hand, 
and days, and months, and years, and ages [[age]] stand. 
here spring appears with flow'ry chaplets bound; 
here summer in her wheaten garland crown'd; 
here autumn the [[rich]] trodden grapes besmear; 
and hoary winter shivers in the reer. 

phoebus beheld the [[youth]] from off his [[throne]]; 
that eye, which looks on all, was fix'd in one. 
he saw the boy's confusion in his face, 
surpriz'd at all the wonders of the place; 
and cries aloud, "what wants my [[son]]? for [[know]] 
my [[son]] thou art [[arts]], and i must call thee so." 
"light of the [[world]]," the trembling [[youth]] replies, 
"illustrious parent! since you don't despise 
the parent's name, some [[certain]] token give, 
that i may clymene's proud boast [[believe]], 
nor longer under false reproaches grieve." 

the tender sire was touch'd with what he said, 
and flung the blaze of glories from his head, 
and bid the [[youth]] advance: "my [[son]]," said he, 
"come to thy father's arms! for clymene 
has told thee true; a parent's name i own, 
and deem thee worthy to be called my [[son]]. 
as a sure proof, make some request, and i, 
whate'er it be, with that request comply; 
by styx i swear, whose waves are hid in night, 
and roul impervious to my piercing sight." 
the [[youth]] transported, asks, without delay, 
to guide the sun's bright chariot for a day. 

the [[god]] repented of the oath he took, 
for anguish thrice his radiant head he shook; 
"my [[son]]," says he, "some other proof require, 
rash was my promise, rash is thy [[desire]]. 
i'd fain deny this [[wish]], which thou hast made, 
or, what i can't deny, wou'd fain disswade. 
too vast and hazardous the task appears, 
nor suited to thy [[strength]], nor to thy years. 
thy lot is mortal, but thy wishes [[wish]] fly 
beyond the province of [[mortality]]: 
there is not one of all the gods that dares 
(however skill'd in other [[great]] affairs) 
to mount the burning axle-tree, but i; 
not jove himself, the ruler of the [[sky]], 
that hurles the three-fork'd thunder from above, 
dares try his [[strength]]: yet who so [[strong]] as jove? 
the steeds climb up the first ascent with [[pain]], 
and when the middle firmament they gain, 
if downward from the heav'ns my head i bow, 
and see the [[earth]] and ocean hang below, 
ev'n i am seiz'd with [[horror]] and affright, 
and my own [[heart]] misgives me at the sight. 
a mighty downfal steeps the ev'ning stage, 
and steddy reins must curb the horses' rage. 
tethys herself has fear'd to see me driv'n 
down headlong from the precipice of heav'n. 
besides, consider what impetuous [[force]] 
turns stars and planets in a diff'rent course. 
i steer against their motions; nor am i 
born back by all the current of the [[sky]]. 
but how cou'd you resist the orbs that roul 
in adverse whirls, and stem the rapid pole? 
but you perhaps may [[hope]] for pleasing woods, 
and stately dooms, and cities [[city]] fill'd with gods; 
while through a thousand snares your [[progress]] lies [[lie]], 
where forms of starry monsters stock the skies [[sky]]: 
for, shou'd you hit the doubtful way aright, 
the bull with stooping horns stands opposite; 
next him the bright haemonian bow is strung, 
and next, the lion's grinning visage hung: 
the scorpion's claws, here clasp a wide extent; 
and here the crab's in lesser clasps are bent. 
nor wou'd you find it easie to compose 
the mettled steeds, when from their nostrils flows 
the scorching [[fire]], that in their entrails glows. 
ev'n i their head-strong fury scarce restrain, 
when they grow warm and restif to the rein. 
let not my [[son]] a fatal gift require, 
but, o! in [[time]], recall your rash [[desire]]; 
you ask a gift that may your parent tell, 
let these my fears [[fear]] your parentage reveal; 
and learn a [[father]] from a father's [[care]]: 
look on my face; or if my [[heart]] lay bare, 
cou'd you but look, you'd [[read]] the [[father]] there. 
chuse out a gift from seas, or [[earth]], or skies [[sky]], 
for open to your [[wish]] all [[nature]] lies [[lie]], 
only decline this one unequal task, 
for 'tis a mischief, not a gift, you ask. 
you ask a real mischief, phaeton: 
nay hang not thus about my neck, my [[son]]: 
i grant your [[wish]], and styx has heard my voice, 
chuse what you will, but make a wiser [[choice]]." 

thus did the [[god]] th' unwary [[youth]] advise; 
but he still longs to travel through the skies [[sky]]. 
when the fond [[father]] (for in [[vain]] he pleads) 
at length to the vulcanian chariot leads. 
a golden axle did the [[work]] uphold, 
gold was the beam, the wheels were orb'd with gold. 
the spokes in rows of silver pleas'd the sight, 
the seat with party-colour'd gems was bright; 
apollo shin'd amid the glare of [[light]]. 
the [[youth]] with secret joy the [[work]] surveys, 
when now the moon disclos'd her purple rays; 
the stars were fled, for lucifer had chased 
the stars away, and fled himself at [[last]]. 
soon as the [[father]] saw the rosy morn, 
and the moon shining with a blunter horn, 
he bid the nimble hours, without delay, 
bring forth the steeds; the nimble hours obey: 
from their full racks the gen'rous steeds retire, 
dropping ambrosial foams, and snorting [[fire]]. 
still anxious for his [[son]], the [[god]] of day, 
to make him proof against the burning ray, 
his temples with celestial ointment wet, 
of sov'reign [[virtue]] to repel the heat; 
then fix'd the beamy circle on his head, 
and fetch'd a deep foreboding sigh, and said, 
"take this at least, this [[last]] [[advice]], my [[son]], 
keep a stiff rein, and move but gently on: 
the coursers of themselves will run too fast, 
your art [[arts]] must be to moderate their haste. 
drive 'em not on directly through the skies [[sky]], 
but where the zodiac's winding circle lies [[lie]], 
along the midmost zone; but sally forth 
nor to the distant south, nor stormy north. 
the horses' hoofs a beaten track will show, 
but neither mount too high, nor sink too low. 
that no new fires [[fire]], or heav'n or [[earth]] infest; 
keep the mid way, the middle way is [[best]]. 
nor, where in radiant folds the serpent twines, 
direct your course, nor where the altar shines. 
shun both extreams; the rest let [[fortune]] guide, 
and [[better]] for thee than thy [[self]] provide! 
see, while i speak, the shades disperse away, 
aurora gives the promise of a day; 
i'm call'd, nor can i make a longer stay. 
snatch up the reins; or still th' attempt forsake, 
and not my chariot, but my counsel, take, 
while yet securely on the [[earth]] you stand; 
nor touch the horses with too rash a hand. 
let me alone to [[light]] the [[world]], while you 
enjoy those beams which you may safely view." 
he spoke in [[vain]]; the [[youth]] with active heat 
and sprightly vigour vaults into the seat; 
and joys to hold the reins, and fondly gives 
those thanks his [[father]] with remorse receives. 

mean-while the restless horses neigh'd aloud, 
breathing out [[fire]], and pawing where they stood. 
tethys, not knowing what had [[past]], gave way, 
and all the waste of heav'n before 'em lay. 
they spring together out, and swiftly bear 
the flying [[youth]] thro' clouds and yielding air; 
with wingy speed outstrip the eastern wind, 
and leave the breezes of the morn behind. 
the [[youth]] was [[light]], nor cou'd he fill the seat, 
or poise the chariot with its wonted weight: 
but as at sea th' unballass'd vessel rides, 
cast to and fro, the [[sport]] of winds and tides; 
so in the bounding chariot toss'd on high, 
the [[youth]] is hurry'd headlong through the [[sky]]. 
soon as the steeds perceive it, they forsake 
their stated course, and leave the beaten track. 
the [[youth]] was in a maze, nor did he [[know]] 
which way to turn the reins, or where to go; 
nor wou'd the horses, had he known, obey. 
then the sev'n stars first [[felt]] apollo's ray, 
and wish'd to dip in the forbidden sea. 
the folded serpent next the frozen pole, 
stiff and benum'd before, began to rowle, 
and raged with inward heat, and threaten'd [[war]], 
and shot a redder [[light]] from ev'ry star; 
nay, and 'tis said bootes too, that fain 
thou woud'st have fled, tho' cumber'd with thy wane. 

th' unhappy [[youth]] then, bending down his head, 
saw [[earth]] and ocean far beneath him spread. 
his colour chang'd, he startled at the sight, 
and his [[eyes]] darken'd by too [[great]] a [[light]]. 
now cou'd he [[wish]] the fiery steeds untry'd, 
his birth obscure, and his request deny'd: 
now wou'd he merops for his [[father]] own, 
and quit his boasted kindred to the sun. 

so fares the pilot, when his ship is tost 
in troubled seas, and all its steerage lost, 
he gives her to the winds, and in despair 
seeks his [[last]] refuge in the gods and pray'r. 

what cou'd he do? his [[eyes]], if backward cast, 
find a long path he had already [[past]]; 
if forward, still a longer path they find: 
both he compares, and measures in his [[mind]]; 
and sometimes casts an eye upon the east, 
and sometimes looks on the forbidden west, 
the horses' names he knew not in the fright, 
nor wou'd he loose the reins, nor cou'd he hold 'em [[right]].

now all the horrors of the heav'ns he spies, 
and monstrous shadows of prodigious size, 
that, deck'd with stars, lye scatter'd o'er the skies [[sky]]. 
there is a place above, where scorpio bent 
in tail and arms surrounds a vast extent; 
in a wide circuit of the heav'ns he shines, 
and fills the space of two coelestial signs. 
soon as the [[youth]] beheld him vex'd with heat 
brandish his sting, and in his poison sweat, 
half [[dead]] with sudden [[fear]] he dropt the reins; 
the horses [[felt]] 'em loose upon their mains, 
and, flying out through all the plains above, 
ran uncontroul'd where-e're their fury drove; 
rush'd on the stars, and through a pathless way 
of unknown regions hurry'd on the day. 
and now above, and now below they flew, 
and near the [[earth]] the burning chariot drew. 

the clouds disperse in fumes, the wond'ring moon 
beholds her brother's steeds beneath her own; 
the highlands smoak, cleft by the piercing rays, 
or, clad with woods, in their own fewel blaze. 
next o'er the plains, where ripen'd harvests grow, 
the running conflagration spreads below. 
but these are trivial ills: whole cities [[city]] burn, 
and peopled kingdoms [[kingdom]] into ashes turn. 

the mountains kindle as the car draws near, 
athos and tmolus red with fires [[fire]] appear; 
oeagrian haemus (then a [[single]] name) 
and virgin helicon increase the flame; 
taurus and oete glare amid the [[sky]], 
and ida, spight of all her fountains, dry. 
eryx and othrys, and cithaeron, glow, 
and rhodope, no longer cloath'd in snow; 
high pindus, mimas, and parnassus, sweat, 
and aetna rages with redoubled heat. 
ev'n scythia, through her hoary regions warm'd, 
in [[vain]] with all her native frost was arm'd. 
cover'd with flames the tow'ring appennine, 
and caucasus, and proud [[olympus]], shine; 
and, where the long-extended alpes aspire, 
now stands a huge continu'd range of [[fire]]. 

th' astonisht [[youth]], where-e'er his [[eyes]] cou'd turn, 
beheld the [[universe]] around him burn: 
the [[world]] was in a blaze; nor cou'd he bear 
the sultry vapours and the scorching air, 
which from below, as from a furnace, flow'd; 
and now the axle-tree beneath him glow'd: 
lost in the whirling clouds that round him broke, 
and [[white]] with ashes, hov'ring in the smoke. 
he flew where-e'er the horses drove, nor knew 
whither the horses drove, or where he flew. 

'twas then, they say, the swarthy moor begun 
to [[change]] his hue, and blacken in the sun. 
then libya first, of all her moisture drain'd, 
became a barren waste, a wild of sand. 
the water-nymphs lament their empty urns, 
boeotia, robb's of silve dirce, mourns, 
corinth pyrene's wasted spring bewails, 
and argos grieves whilst amymone fails. 

the floods are drain'd from ev'ry distant coast, 
ev'n tanais, tho' fix'd in ice, was lost. 
enrag'd caicus and lycormas roar, 
and xanthus, fated to be burnt once more. 
the fam'd maeander, that unweary'd strays 
through mazy windings, smoaks in ev'ry maze. 
from his lov'd [[babylon]] euphrates flies; 
the big-swoln ganges and the danube rise 
in thick'ning fumes, and darken half the skies [[sky]]. 
in flames ismenos and the phasis roul'd, 
and tagus floating in his melted gold. 
the swans, that on cayster often try'd 
their tuneful songs [[song]], now sung their [[last]] and dy'd. 
the frighted nile ran off, and under ground 
conceal'd his head, nor can it yet be found: 
his sev'n divided currents all are dry, 
and where they row'ld, sev'n gaping trenches lye: 
no more the rhine or rhone their course maintain, 
nor tiber, of his promis'd [[empire]] [[vain]]. 

the ground, deep-cleft, admits the dazling ray, 
and startles pluto with the flash of day. 
the seas shrink in, and to the sight disclose 
wide naked plains, where once their billows rose; 
their rocks are all discover'd, and increase 
the number of the scatter'd cyclades. 
the fish in sholes about the bottom creep, 
nor longer dares the crooked dolphin leap 
gasping for breath, th' unshapen phocae [[die]], 
and on the boiling wave extended lye. 
nereus, and doris with her virgin train, 
seek out the [[last]] recesses of the main; 
beneath unfathomable depths they faint, 
and secret in their gloomy caverns pant. 
stern [[neptune]] thrice above the waves upheld 
his face, and thrice was by the flames repell'd. 

the [[earth]] at length, on ev'ry side embrac'd 
with scalding seas that floated round her waste, 
when now she [[felt]] the springs and rivers come, 
and crowd within the hollow of her womb, 
up-lifted to the heav'ns her blasted head, 
and clapt her hand upon her brows, and said 
(but first, impatient of the sultry heat, 
sunk deeper down, and sought a cooler seat): 
"if you, [[great]] [[king]] of gods, my [[death]] approve, 
and i deserve it, let me [[die]] by jove; 
if i must perish by the [[force]] of [[fire]], 
let me transfix'd with thunder-bolts expire. 
see, whilst i speak, my breath the vapours choak 
(for now her face lay wrapt in clouds of smoak), 
see my singe'd hair, behold my faded eye, 
and wither'd face, where heaps of cinders lye! 
and does the plow for this my [[body]] tear? 
this the [[reward]] for all the fruits i bear, 
tortur'd with rakes, and harrass'd all the year? 
that herbs for cattle daily i renew, 
and food for [[man]], and frankincense for you? 
but grant me guilty; what has [[neptune]] done? 
why are his waters boiling in the sun? 
the wavy [[empire]], which by lot was giv'n, 
why does it waste, and further shrink from heav'n? 
if i nor he your [[pity]] can provoke, 
see your own heav'ns, the heav'ns begin to smoke! 
shou'd once the sparkles catch those bright abodes, 
destruction seizes on the heav'ns and gods; 
atlas becomes unequal to his freight, 
and almost faints beneath the glowing weight. 
if heav'n, and [[earth]], and sea, together burn, 
all must again into their [[chaos]] turn. 
apply some speedy cure, prevent our [[fate]], 
and succour [[nature]], ere it be too late." 
she cea'sd, for choak'd with vapours round her spread, 
down to the deepest shades she sunk her head. 

jove call'd to witness ev'ry pow'r above, 
and ev'n the [[god]], whose [[son]] the chariot drove, 
that what he acts he is compell'd to do, 
or universal ruin must ensue. 
strait he ascends the high aetherial [[throne]], 
from whence he us'd to dart his thunder down, 
from whence his show'rs and storms he us'd to pour, 
but now cou'd meet with neither storm nor show'r. 
then, aiming at the [[youth]], with lifted hand, 
full at his head he hurl'd the forky brand, 
in dreadful thund'rings. thus th' almighty sire 
suppress'd the raging of the fires [[fire]] with [[fire]]. 

at once from [[life]] and from the chariot driv'n, 
th' ambitious boy fell thunder-struck from heav'n. 
the horses started with a sudden bound, 
and flung the reins and chariot to the ground: 
the studded harness from their necks they broke, 
here fell a wheel, and here a silver spoke, 
here were the beam and axle torn away; 
and, scatter'd o'er the [[earth]], the shining fragments lay.

the breathless phaeton, with flaming hair, 
shot from the chariot, like a falling star, 
that in a summer's ev'ning from the top 
of heav'n drops down, or seems at least to drop; 
'till on the po his blasted corps was hurl'd, 
far from his [[country]], in the western [[world]]. 

phaeton's sisters transform'd into trees 

the latian nymphs [[nymph]] came round him, and, amaz'd, 
on the [[dead]] [[youth]], transfix'd with thunder, gaz'd; 
and, whilst yet smoaking from the bolt he lay, 
his shatter'd [[body]] to a tomb convey, 
and o'er the tomb an epitaph devise: 
"here he, who drove the sun's bright chariot, lies [[lie]]; 
his father's fiery steeds he cou'd not guide, 
but in the glorious enterprize he dy'd." 

apollo hid his face, and pin'd for [[grief]], 
and, if the story may deserve [[belief]], 
the space of one whole day is said to run, 
from morn to wonted ev'n, without a sun: 
the burning ruins, with a fainter ray, 
supply the sun, and counterfeit a day, 
a day, that still did nature's face disclose: 
this comfort from the mighty mischief rose. 

but clymene, enrag'd with [[grief]], laments, 
and as her [[grief]] inspires, her passion vents: 
wild for her [[son]], and frantick in her woes, 
with hair dishevel'd round the [[world]] she goes, 
to seek where-e'er his [[body]] might be cast; 
'till, on the borders of the po, at [[last]] 
the name inscrib'd on the new tomb appears. 
the dear dear name she bathes in flowing tears, 
hangs o'er the tomb, unable to depart, 
and hugs the marble to her throbbing [[heart]]. 

her daughters [[daughter]] too lament, and sigh, and mourn 
(a fruitless tribute to their brother's urn), 
and beat their naked bosoms, and [[complain]], 
and call aloud for phaeton in [[vain]]: 
all the long night their mournful watch they keep, 
and all the day stand round the tomb, and weep. 

four times [[time]], revolving, the full moon return'd; 
so long the [[mother]] and the daughters [[daughter]] mourn'd: 
when now the eldest, phaethusa, strove 
to rest her weary limbs, but could not move; 
lampetia wou'd have help'd her, but she found 
her [[self]] with-held, and rooted to the ground: 
a third in wild affliction, as she grieves, 
wou'd rend her hair, but fills her hands with leaves; 
one sees her thighs transform'd, another views 
her arms shot out, and branching into boughs. 
and now their legs, and breasts, and bodies [[body]] stood 
crusted with bark, and hard'ning into wood; 
but still above were female heads display'd, 
and mouths, that call'd the [[mother]] to their aid. 
what cou'd, alas! the weeping [[mother]] do? 
from this to that with eager haste she flew, 
and kiss'd her sprouting daughters [[daughter]] as they grew. 
she tears the bark that to each [[body]] cleaves, 
and from their verdant fingers strips the leaves: 
the [[blood]] came trickling, where she tore away 
the leaves and bark: the maids were heard to say, 
"forbear, mistaken parent, oh! forbear; 
a wounded [[daughter]] in each tree you tear; 
farewell for ever." here the bark encreas'd, 
clos'd on their faces, and their words suppress'd. 

the new-made trees in tears of amber run, 
which, harden'd into value by the sun, 
distill for ever on the streams below: 
the limpid streams their radiant treasure show, 
mixt in the sand; whence the [[rich]] drops convey'd 
shine in the dress of the bright latian maid. 

the transformation of cycnus into a swan 

cycnus beheld the nymphs [[nymph]] transform'd, ally'd 
to their [[dead]] [[brother]] on the mortal side, 
in [[friendship]] and affection nearer bound; 
he left the cities [[city]] and the realms he own'd, 
thro' pathless fields and lonely shores to range, 
and woods made thicker by the sisters' [[change]]. 
whilst here, within the dismal gloom, alone, 
the melancholy monarch made his moan, 
his voice was lessen'd, as he try'd to speak, 
and issu'd through a long-extended neck; 
his hair transforms to down, his fingers meet 
in skinny films, and shape his oary feet; 
from both his sides the wings and feathers break; 
and from his mouth proceeds a blunted beak: 
all cycnus now into a swan was turn'd, 
who, still remembring how his kinsman burn'd, 
to solitary pools and lakes retires, 
and loves [[love]] the waters as oppos'd to fires [[fire]]. 

mean-while [[apollo]] in a gloomy shade 
(the native lustre of his brows decay'd) 
indulging [[sorrow]], sickens at the sight 
of his own sun-shine, and abhors the [[light]]; 
the hidden griefs, that in his bosom rise, 
sadden his looks and over-cast his [[eyes]], 
as when some dusky orb obstructs his ray, 
and sullies in a dim eclipse the day. 

now secretly with inward griefs he pin'd, 
now warm resentments to his griefs he joyn'd, 
and now renounc'd his office to [[mankind]]. 
"ere since the birth of [[time]]," said he, "i've born 
a long ungrateful toil, without return; 
let now some other manage, if he dare, 
the fiery steeds, and mount the burning carr; 
or, if none else, let jove his [[fortune]] try, 
and learn to lay his murd'ring thunder by; 
then will he own, perhaps, but own too late, 
my [[son]] deserv'd not so severe a [[fate]]." 

the gods stand round him, as he mourns, and [[pray]] 
he would resume the conduct of the day, 
nor let the [[world]] be lost in endless night: 
jove too himself descending from his height, 
excuses what had happen'd, and intreats, 
majestically mixing pray'rs and threats. 
prevail'd upon at length, again he took 
the harness'd steeds, that still with [[horror]] shook, 
and plies 'em with the lash, and whips 'em on, 
and, as he whips, upbraids 'em with his [[son]]. 

the story of calisto 

the day was settled in its course; and jove 
walk'd the wide circuit of the heavens [[heaven]] above, 
to search if any cracks or flaws were made; 
but all was safe: the [[earth]] he then survey'd, 
and cast an eye on ev'ry diff'rent coast, 
and ev'ry [[land]]; but on arcadia most. 
her fields he cloath'd, and chear'd her blasted face 
with running fountains, and with springing grass. 
no tracks of heav'n's destructive [[fire]] remain, 
the fields and woods revive, and [[nature]] smiles again. 

but as the [[god]] walk'd to and fro the [[earth]], 
and rais'd the plants, and gave the spring its birth, 
by [[chance]] a [[fair]] arcadian [[nymph]] he view'd, 
and [[felt]] the lovely charmer in his [[blood]]. 
the [[nymph]] nor spun, nor dress'd with artful [[pride]], 
her vest was gather'd up, her hair was ty'd; 
now in her hand a slender spear she bore, 
now a [[light]] quiver on her shoulders wore; 
to chaste diana from her [[youth]] inclin'd, 
the sprightly warriors of the wood she joyn'd. 
diana too the gentle huntress lov'd, 
nor was there one of all the nymphs [[nymph]] that rov'd 
o'er maenalus, amid the maiden throng, 
more favour'd once; but favour lasts not long. 

the sun now shone in all its [[strength]], and drove 
the heated virgin panting to a grove; 
the grove around a grateful shadow cast: 
she dropt her arrows, and her bow unbrac'd; 
she flung her [[self]] on the cool grassy bed; 
and on the painted quiver rais'd her head, 
jove saw the charming huntress unprepar'd, 
stretch'd on the verdant turf, without a guard. 
"here i am safe," he cries, "from juno's eye; 
or shou'd my [[jealous]] queen the theft descry, 
yet wou'd i venture on a theft like this, 
and stand her rage for such, for such a bliss!" 
diana's shape and habit strait he took, 
soften'd his brows, and smooth'd his awful look, 
and mildly in a female accent spoke. 
"how fares my girl? how went the morning chase?" 
to whom the virgin, starting from the grass, 
"all hail, bright deity, whom i prefer 
to jove himself, tho' jove himself were here." 
the [[god]] was nearer than she [[thought]], and heard 
well-pleas'd himself before himself preferr'd. 

he then salutes her with a warm embrace; 
and, e're she half had told the morning chase, 
with [[love]] enflam'd, and eager on his bliss, 
smother'd her words, and stop'd her with a kiss; 
his kisses with unwonted ardour glow'd, 
nor cou'd diana's shape conceal the [[god]]. 
the virgin did whate'er a virgin cou'd 
(sure juno must have pardon'd, had she view'd); 
with all her might against his [[force]] she strove; 
but how can mortal maids contend with jove? 

possest at length of what his [[heart]] desir'd, 
back to his heav'ns, th' exulting [[god]] retir'd. 
the lovely huntress, rising from the grass, 
with down-cast [[eyes]], and with a blushing face, 
by shame confounded, and by [[fear]] dismay'd, 
flew from the covert of the guilty shade, 
and almost, in the tumult of her [[mind]], 
left her forgotten bow and shafts behind. 

but now diana, with a sprightly train 
of quiver'd virgins, bounding o'er the plain, 
call'd to the [[nymph]]; the [[nymph]] began to [[fear]] 
a second fraud, a jove disguis'd in her; 
but, when she saw the sister nymphs [[nymph]], suppress'd 
her rising fears [[fear]], and mingled with the rest. 

how in the look does conscious guilt appear! 
slowly she mov'd, and loiter'd in the rear; 
nor lightly tripp'd, nor by the [[goddess]] ran, 
as once she us'd, the foremost of the train. 
her looks were flush'd, and sullen was her mien, 
that sure the virgin [[goddess]] (had she been 
aught but a virgin) must the guilt have seen. 
'tis said the nymphs [[nymph]] saw all, and guess'd aright: 
and now the moon had nine times [[time]] lost her [[light]], 
when dian, fainting in the mid-day beams, 
found a cool covert, and refreshing streams 
that in soft murmurs through the forest flow'd, 
and a smooth bed of shining gravel show'd. 

a covert so obscure, and streams so clear, 
the [[goddess]] prais'd: "and now no spies are near 
let's strip, my gentle maids, and wash," she cries. 
pleas'd with the motion, every maid complies; 
only the blushing huntress stood confus'd, 
and form'd delays, and her delays excus'd; 
in [[vain]] excus'd: her fellows round her press'd, 
and the reluctant [[nymph]] by [[force]] undress'd, 
the naked huntress all her shame reveal'd, 
in [[vain]] her hands the pregnant womb conceal'd; 
"begone!" the [[goddess]] cries with stern disdain, 
"begone! nor dare the hallow'd stream to stain": 
she fled, for ever banish'd from the train. 

this juno heard, who long had watch'd her [[time]] 
to punish the detested rival's crime; 
the [[time]] was come; for, to enrage her more, 
a lovely boy the teeming rival bore. 

the [[goddess]] cast a furious look, and cry'd, 
"it is enough! i'm fully satisfy'd! 
this boy shall stand a living mark, to prove 
my husband's baseness and the strumpet's [[love]]: 
but vengeance shall awake: those guilty charms 
that drew the thunderer from juno's arms, 
no longer shall their wonted [[force]] retain, 
nor please the [[god]], nor make the mortal [[vain]]." 

this said, her hand within her hair she wound, 
swung her to [[earth]], and drag'd her on the ground: 
the prostrate wretch lifts up her arms in pray'r; 
her arms grow shaggy, and deform'd with hair, 
her nails are sharpen'd into pointed claws, 
her hands bear half her weight, and turn to paws; 
her lips, that once cou'd tempt a [[god]], begin 
to grow distorted in an ugly grin. 
and, lest the supplicating brute might reach 
the ears of jove, she was depriv'd of [[speech]]: 
her surly voice thro' a hoarse passage came 
in savage sounds: her [[mind]] was still the same, 
the furry monster fix'd her [[eyes]] above, 
and heav'd her new unwieldy paws to jove, 
and beg'd his aid with inward groans; and tho' 
she could not call him false, she [[thought]] him so. 

how did she [[fear]] to lodge in woods alone, 
and haunt the fields and meadows, once her own! 
how often wou'd the deep-mouth'd dogs pursue, 
whilst from her hounds the frighted huntress flew! 
how did she [[fear]] her fellow-brutes, and shun 
the shaggy bear, tho' now her [[self]] was one! 
how from the sight of rugged wolves retire, 
although the grim lycaon was her sire! 

but now her [[son]] had fifteen summers told, 
fierce at the chase, and in the forest bold; 
when, as he beat the woods in quest of prey, 
he chanc'd to rouze his [[mother]] where she lay. 
she knew her [[son]], and kept him in her sight, 
and fondly gaz'd: the boy was in a fright, 
and aim'd a pointed arrow at her breast, 
and would have slain his [[mother]] in the beast; 
but jove forbad, and snatch'd 'em through the air 
in whirlwinds up to heav'n, and fix'd 'em there! 
where the new constellations nightly rise, 
and add a lustre to the northern skies [[sky]]. 

when juno saw the rival in her height, 
spangled with stars, and circled round with [[light]], 
she sought old ocean in his deep abodes, 
and tethys, both rever'd among the gods. 
they ask what brings her there: "ne'er ask," says she, 
"what brings me here, heav'n is no place for me. 
you'll see, when night has cover'd all things o'er, 
jove's starry bastard and triumphant whore 
usurp the heav'ns; you'll see 'em proudly rowle 
and who shall now on juno's altars wait, 
when those she hates grow greater by her hate? 
i on the [[nymph]] a brutal form impress'd, 
jove to a [[goddess]] has transform'd the beast; 
this, this was all my [[weak]] [[revenge]] could do: 
but let the [[god]] his chaste amours pursue, 
and, as he acted after io's rape, 
restore th' adultress to her former shape; 
then may he cast his juno off, and lead 
the [[great]] lycaon's offspring to his bed. 
but you, ye venerable pow'rs, be [[kind]], 
and, if my wrongs [[wrong]] a due resentment find, 
receive not in your waves their setting beams, 
nor let the glaring strumpet taint your streams." 

the [[goddess]] ended, and her [[wish]] was giv'n. 
back she return'd in triumph up to heav'n; 
her gawdy peacocks drew her through the skies [[sky]]. 
their tails were spotted with a thousand [[eyes]]; 
the [[eyes]] of argus on their tails were rang'd, 
at the same [[time]] the raven's colour chang'd. 

the story of coronis, and birth of aesculapius 

the raven once in snowy plumes was drest, 
white as the whitest dove's unsully'd breast, 
fair as the guardian of the capitol, 
soft as the swan; a large and lovely fowl; 
his tongue, his prating tongue had chang'd him quite 
to sooty blackness, from the purest [[white]]. 

the story of his [[change]] shall here be told; 
in thessaly there liv'd a [[nymph]] of old, 
coronis nam'd; a peerless maid she shin'd, 
confest the fairest of the fairer [[kind]]. 
apollo lov'd her, 'till her guilt he knew, 
while true she was, or whilst he [[thought]] her true. 
but his own bird the raven chanc'd to find 
the false one with a secret rival joyn'd. 
coronis begg'd him to suppress the tale, 
but could not with repeated pray'rs prevail. 
his milk-white pinions to the [[god]] he ply'd; 
the busy daw flew with him, side by side, 
and by a thousand teizing questions [[question]] drew 
th' important secret from him as they flew. 
the daw gave honest counsel, tho' despis'd, 
and, tedious in her tattle, thus advis'd: 
"stay, silly bird, th' ill-natur'd task refuse, 
nor be the bearer of unwelcome news. 
be warn'd by my [[example]]: you discern 
what now i am, and what i was shall learn. 
my foolish honesty was all my crime; 
then hear my story. once upon a [[time]], 
the two-shap'd ericthonius had his birth 
(without a mother) from the teeming [[earth]]; 
minerva nurs'd him, and the infant laid 
within a chest, of twining osiers made. 
the daughters [[daughter]] of [[king]] cecrops undertook 
to guard the chest, commanded not to look 
on what was hid within. i stood to see 
the charge obey'd, perch'd on a neighb'ring tree. 
the sisters pandrosos and herse keep 
the strict command; aglauros needs would peep, 
and saw the monstrous infant, in a fright, 
and call'd her sisters to the hideous sight: 
a boy's soft shape did to the waste prevail, 
but the boy ended in a dragon's tail. 
i told the stern minerva all that pass'd; 
but for my pains [[pain]], discarded and disgrac'd, 
the frowning [[goddess]] drove me from her sight, 
and for her fav'rite chose the bird of night. 
be then no tell-tale; for i [[think]] my [[wrong]] 
enough to [[teach]] a bird to hold her tongue. 

but you, perhaps, may [[think]] i was remov'd, 
as never by the heav'nly maid belov'd: 
but i was lov'd; ask pallas if i lye; 
tho' pallas hate me now, she won't deny: 
for i, whom in a feather'd shape you view, 
was once a maid (by heav'n the story's true) 
a blooming maid, and a king's [[daughter]] too. 
a crowd of lovers own'd my beauty's charms; 
my [[beauty]] was the cause of all my harms; 
neptune, as on his shores i wont to rove, 
observ'd me in my walks, and fell in [[love]]. 
he made his courtship, he confess'd his [[pain]], 
and offer'd [[force]], when all his [[arts]] were [[vain]]; 
swift he pursu'd: i ran along the strand, 
'till, spent and weary'd on the sinking sand, 
i shriek'd aloud, with cries i fill'd the air 
to gods and [[men]]; nor [[god]] nor [[man]] was there: 
a virgin [[goddess]] heard a virgin's pray'r. 
for, as my arms i lifted to the skies [[sky]], 
i saw black feathers from my fingers rise; 
i strove to fling my garment on the ground; 
my garment turn'd to plumes, and girt me round: 
my hands to beat my naked bosom try; 
nor naked bosom now nor hands had i: 
lightly i tript, nor weary as before 
sunk in the sand, but skim'd along the shore; 
'till, rising on my wings, i was preferr'd 
to be the chaste minerva's virgin bird: 
preferr'd in vain! i am now in disgrace: 
nyctimene the owl enjoys my place. 

on her incestuous [[life]] i need not dwell 
(in lesbos still the horrid tale they tell), 
and of her dire amours you must have heard, 
for which she now does penance in a bird, 
that conscious of her shame, avoids the [[light]], 
and loves [[love]] the gloomy cov'ring of the night; 
the birds, where-e'er she flutters, scare away 
the hooting wretch, and drive her from the day." 

the raven, urg'd by such impertinence, 
grew passionate, it seems, and took offence, 
and curst the harmless daw; the daw withdrew: 
the raven to her injur'd patron flew, 
and found him out, and told the fatal [[truth]] 
of false coronis and the favour'd [[youth]]. 

the [[god]] was wroth, the colour left his look, 
the wreath his head, the harp his hand forsook: 
his silver bow and feather'd shafts he took, 
and lodg'd an arrow in the tender breast, 
that had so often to his own been prest. 
down fell the wounded [[nymph]], and sadly groan'd, 
and pull'd his arrow reeking from the wound; 
and weltring in her [[blood]], thus faintly cry'd, 
"ah cruel god! tho' i have justly dy'd, 
what has, alas! my unborn infant done, 
that he should fall, and two expire in one?" 
this said, in agonies she fetch'd her breath. 

the [[god]] dissolves in [[pity]] at her [[death]]; 
he hates the bird that made her falshood known, 
and hates himself for what himself had done; 
the feather'd shaft, that sent her to the fates [[fate]], 
and his own hand, that sent the shaft, he hates. 
fain would he heal the wound, and ease her [[pain]], 
and tries the compass of his art [[arts]] in [[vain]]. 
soon as he saw the lovely [[nymph]] expire, 
the pile made ready, and the kindling [[fire]]. 
with sighs and groans her obsequies he kept, 
and, if a [[god]] could weep, the [[god]] had wept. 
her corps he kiss'd, and heav'nly incense brought, 
and solemniz'd the [[death]] himself had wrought. 

but lest his offspring should her [[fate]] partake, 
spight of th' [[immortal]] mixture in his make, 
he ript her womb, and set the child at large, 
and gave him to the centaur chiron's charge: 
then in his fury black'd the raven o'er, 
and bid him prate in his [[white]] plumes no more. 

ocyrrhoe transform'd into a mare 

old chiron took the babe with secret joy, 
proud of the charge of the celestial boy. 
his [[daughter]] too, whom on the sandy shore 
the [[nymph]] charicle to the centaur bore, 
with hair dishevel'd on her shoulders, came 
to see the child, ocyrrhoe was her name; 
she knew her father's [[arts]], and could rehearse 
the depths of prophecy in sounding verse. 
once, as the [[sacred]] infant she survey'd, 
the [[god]] was kindled in the raving maid, 
and thus she utter'd her prophetick tale: 
"hail, [[great]] physician of the [[world]], all-hail; 
hail, mighty infant, who in years to come 
shalt heal the nations, and defraud the tomb; 
swift be thy growth! thy triumphs unconfin'd! 
make kingdoms [[kingdom]] thicker, and increase [[mankind]]. 
thy daring art [[arts]] shall animate the [[dead]], 
and draw the thunder on thy guilty head: 
then shalt thou dye, but from the dark abode 
rise up victorious, and be twice a [[god]]. 
and thou, my sire, not destin'd by thy birth 
to turn to dust, and mix with [[common]] [[earth]], 
how wilt thou toss, and rave, and long to dye, 
and quit thy claim to immortality; 
when thou shalt [[feel]], enrag'd with inward pains [[pain]], 
the hydra's venom rankling in thy veins? 
the gods, in [[pity]], shall contract thy date, 
and give thee over to the pow'r of [[fate]]." 

thus entring into [[destiny]], the maid 
the secrets of offended jove betray'd: 
more had she still to say; but now appears 
oppress'd with sobs and sighs, and drown'd in tears. 
"my voice," says she, "is gone, my [[language]] fails; 
through ev'ry limb my kindred shape prevails: 
why did the [[god]] this fatal gift impart, 
and with prophetick raptures swell my heart! 
what new desires [[desire]] are these? i long to pace 
o'er flow'ry meadows, and to feed on grass; 
i hasten to a brute, a maid no more; 
but why, alas! am i transform'd all o'er? 
my sire does half a [[human]] shape retain, 
and in his upper parts preserve the [[man]]." 

her tongue no more distinct complaints affords, 
but in shrill accents and mis-shapen words 
pours forth such hideous wailings, as declare 
the [[human]] form confounded in the mare: 
'till by degrees [[degree]] accomplish'd in the beast, 
she neigh'd outright, and all the steed exprest. 
her stooping [[body]] on her hands is born, 
her hands are turn'd to hoofs, and shod in horn, 
her yellow tresses ruffle in a mane, 
and in a flowing tail she frisks her train, 
the mare was finish'd in her voice and look, 
and a new name from the new figure took. 

the transformation of battus to a touch stone 

sore wept the centuar, and to phoebus pray'd; 
but how could phoebus give the centaur aid? 
degraded of his pow'r by angry jove, 
in elis then a herd of beeves he drove; 
and wielded in his hand a staff of oak, 
and o'er his shoulders threw the shepherd's cloak; 
on sev'n compacted reeds he us'd to play, 
and on his rural pipe to waste the day. 

as once attentive to his pipe he play'd, 
the crafty hermes from the [[god]] convey'd 
a drove, that sep'rate from their fellows stray'd. 
the theft an old insidious peasant view'd 
(they call'd him battus in the neighbourhood), 
hir'd by a vealthy pylian [[prince]] to feed 
his fav'rite mares, and watch the gen'rous breed. 
the thievish [[god]] suspected him, and took 
the hind aside, and thus in whispers spoke: 
"discover not the theft, whoe'er thou be, 
and take that milk-white heifer for thy fee." 
"go, stranger," cries the clown, "securely on, 
that stone shall sooner tell," and show'd a stone. 

the [[god]] withdrew, but strait return'd again, 
in [[speech]] and habit like a [[country]] swain; 
and cries out, "neighbour, hast thou seen a stray 
of bullocks and of heifers pass this way? 
in the recov'ry of my cattle join, 
a bullock and a heifer shall be thine." 
the peasant quick replies, "you'll find 'em there 
in yon dark vale"; and in the vale they were. 
the double bribe had his false [[heart]] beguil'd: 
the [[god]], successful in the tryal, smil'd; 
"and dost thou thus betray my [[self]] to me? 
me to my [[self]] dost thou betray?" says he: 
then to a touch stone turns the faithless spy; 
and in his name records his infamy. 

the story of aglauros, transform'd into a statue 

this done, the [[god]] flew up on high, and pass'd 
o'er lofty [[athens]], by minerva grac'd, 
and wide munichia, whilst his [[eyes]] survey 
all the vast region that beneath him lay. 

'twas now the feast, when each athenian maid 
her yearly homage to minerva paid; 
in canisters, with garlands cover'd o'er, 
high on their heads, their mystick gifts they bore: 
and now, returning in a solemn train, 
the troop of shining virgins fill'd the plain. 

the [[god]] well pleas'd beheld the pompous show, 
and saw the bright procession pass below; 
then veer'd about, and took a wheeling flight, 
and hover'd o'er them: as the spreading kite, 
that smells the slaughter'd victim from on high, 
flies at a distance, if the priests [[priest]] are nigh, 
and sails around, and keeps it in her eye: 
so kept the [[god]] the virgin quire in view, 
and in slow winding circles round them flew. 

as lucifer excells the meanest star, 
or, as the full-orb'd phoebe, lucifer; 
so much did herse all the rest outvy, 
and gave a grace to the solemnity. 
hermes was fir'd, as in the clouds he hung: 
so the cold bullet, that with fury slung 
from balearick engines mounts on high, 
glows in the whirl, and burns along the [[sky]]. 
at length he pitch'd upon the ground, and show'd 
the form [[divine]], the features of a [[god]]. 
he knew their vertue o'er a female [[heart]], 
and yet he strives to [[better]] them by art [[arts]]. 
he hangs his mantle loose, and sets to show 
the golden edging on the seam below; 
adjusts his flowing curls, and in his hand 
waves, with an air, the sleep-procuring wand; 
the glitt'ring sandals to his feet applies, 
and to each heel the well-trim'd pinion ties. 

his ornaments with nicest art [[arts]] display'd, 
he seeks th' apartment of the [[royal]] maid. 
the roof was all with polish'd iv'ry lin'd, 
that richly mix'd, in clouds of tortoise shin'd. 
three rooms, contiguous, in a range were plac'd, 
the midmost by the beauteous herse grac'd; 
her virgin sisters lodg'd on either side. 
aglauros first th' approaching [[god]] descry'd, 
and, as he cross'd her chamber, ask'd his name, 
and what his [[business]] was, and whence he came. 
"i come," reply'd the [[god]], "from heav'n, to woo 
your sister, and to make an aunt of you; 
i am the [[son]] and messenger of jove; 
my name is mercury, my bus'ness [[love]]; 
do you, [[kind]] damsel, take a lover's part, 
and gain admittance to your sister's [[heart]]." 

she star'd him in the face with looks amaz'd, 
as when she on minerva's secret gaz'd, 
and asks a mighty treasure for her hire; 
and, 'till he brings it, makes the [[god]] retire. 
minerva griev'd to see the [[nymph]] succeed; 
and now remembring the late impious deed, 
when, disobedient to her strict command, 
she touch'd the chest with an unhallow'd hand; 
in big-swoln sighs her inward rage express'd, 
that heav'd the rising aegis on her breast; 
then sought out envy in her dark abode, 
defil'd with ropy gore and clots of [[blood]]: 
shut from the winds, and from the wholesome skies [[sky]], 
in a deep vale the gloomy dungeon lies [[lie]], 
dismal and cold, where not a beam of [[light]] 
invades the winter, or disturbs the night. 

directly to the cave her course she steer'd; 
against the gates her martial lance she rear'd; 
the gates flew open, and the fiend appear'd. 
a pois'nous morsel in her teeth she chew'd, 
and gorg'd the flesh of vipers for her food. 
minerva loathing turn'd away her eye; 
the hideous monster, rising heavily, 
came stalking forward with a sullen pace, 
and left her mangled offals on the place. 
soon as she saw the [[goddess]] [[gay]] and bright, 
she fetch'd a groan at such a chearful sight. 
livid and meagre were her looks, her eye 
in foul distorted glances turn'd awry; 
a hoard of gall her inward parts possess'd, 
and spread a greenness o'er her canker'd breast; 
her teeth were brown with rust, and from her tongue, 
in dangling drops, the stringy poison hung. 
she never smiles but when the wretched weep, 
nor lulls her malice with a moment's sleep, 
restless in spite: while watchful to [[destroy]], 
she pines and sickens at another's joy; 
foe to her [[self]], distressing and distrest, 
she bears her own tormentor in her breast. 
the [[goddess]] gave (for she abhorr'd her sight) 
a short command: "to [[athens]] speed thy flight; 
on curst aglauros try thy utmost art [[arts]], 
and fix thy rankest venoms in her [[heart]]." 
this said, her spear she push'd against the ground, 
and mounting from it with an active bound, 
flew off to heav'n: the hag with [[eyes]] askew 
look'd up, and mutter'd curses as she flew; 
for sore she fretted, and began to grieve 
at the [[success]] which she her [[self]] must give. 
then takes her staff, hung round with wreaths of thorn, 
and sails along, in a black whirlwind born, 
o'er fields and flow'ry meadows: where she steers 
her baneful course, a mighty blast appears, 
mildews and blights; the meadows are defac'd, 
the fields, the flow'rs, and the whole years laid waste:

on mortals next, and peopled towns she falls, 
and breathes a burning plague among their walls. 

when [[athens]] she beheld, for [[arts]] renown'd, 
with [[peace]] made [[happy]], and with plenty crown'd, 
scarce could the hideous fiend from tears forbear, 
to find out nothing that deserv'd a tear. 
th' apartment now she enter'd, where at rest 
aglauros lay, with gentle sleep opprest. 
to execute minerva's dire command, 
she stroak'd the virgin with her canker'd hand, 
then prickly thorns into her breast convey'd, 
that stung to madness the devoted maid: 
her subtle venom still improves the smart, 
frets in the [[blood]], and festers in the [[heart]]. 

to make the [[work]] more sure, a scene she drew, 
and plac'd before the dreaming virgin's view 
her sister's [[marriage]], and her glorious [[fate]]: 
th' imaginary bride appears in [[state]]; 
the bride-groom with unwonted [[beauty]] glows: 
for envy magnifies what-e'er she shows. 

full of the [[dream]], aglauros pin'd away 
in tears all night, in darkness all the day; 
consum'd like ice, that just begins to run, 
when feebly smitten by the distant sun; 
or like unwholsome weeds, that set on [[fire]] 
are slowly wasted, and in smoke expire. 
giv'n up to envy (for in ev'ry [[thought]] 
the thorns, the venom, and the vision wrought) 
oft did she call on [[death]], as oft decreed, 
rather than see her sister's [[wish]] succeed, 
to tell her awfull [[father]] what had [[past]]: 
at length before the door her [[self]] she cast; 
and, sitting on the ground with sullen [[pride]], 
a passage to the love-sick [[god]] deny'd. 
the [[god]] caress'd, and for admission pray'd, 
and sooth'd in softest words th' envenom'd maid. 
in [[vain]] he sooth'd: "begone!" the maid replies, 
"or here i keep my seat, and never rise." 
"then keep thy seat for ever," cries the [[god]], 
and touch'd the door, wide op'ning to his rod. 
fain would she rise, and stop him, but she found 
her trunk too heavy to forsake the ground; 
her joynts are all benum'd, her hands are pale, 
and marble now appears in ev'ry nail. 
as when a cancer in the [[body]] feeds, 
and gradual [[death]] from limb to limb proceeds; 
so does the chilness to each vital parte 
spread by degrees [[degree]], and creeps into her [[heart]]; 
'till hard'ning ev'ry where, and speechless grown, 
she sits unmov'd, and freezes to a stone. 
but still her envious hue and sullen mien 
are in the sedentary figure seen. 

europa's rape 

when now the [[god]] his fury had allay'd, 
and taken vengeance of the stubborn maid, 
from where the bright athenian turrets rise 
he mounts aloft, and re-ascends the skies [[sky]]. 
jove saw him enter the sublime abodes, 
and, as he mix'd among the crowd of gods, 
beckon'd him out, and drew him from the rest, 
and in soft whispers thus his will exprest. 

"my trusty hermes, by whose ready aid 
thy sire's commands are through the [[world]] convey'd. 
resume thy wings, exert their utmost [[force]], 
and to the walls of sidon speed thy course; 
there find a herd of heifers wand'ring o'er 
the neighb'ring hill, and drive 'em to the shore." 

thus spoke the [[god]], concealing his intent. 
the trusty hermes, on his message went, 
and found the herd of heifers wand'ring o'er 
a neighb'ring hill, and drove 'em to the shore; 
where the king's [[daughter]], with a lovely train 
of fellow-nymphs, was sporting on the plain. 

the [[dignity]] of [[empire]] laid aside, 
(for [[love]] but ill agrees with kingly pride) 
the ruler of the skies [[sky]], the thund'ring [[god]], 
who shakes the world's foundations with a nod, 
among a herd of lowing heifers ran, 
frisk'd in a bull, and bellow'd o'er the plain. 
large rowles of fat about his shoulders clung, 
and from his neck the double dewlap hung. 
his skin was whiter than the snow that lies [[lie]] 
unsully'd by the breath of southern skies [[sky]]; 
small shining horns on his curl'd forehead stand, 
as turn'd and polish'd by the work-man's hand; 
his eye-balls rowl'd, not formidably bright, 
but gaz'd and languish'd with a gentle [[light]]. 
his ev'ry look was peaceful, and exprest 
the softness of the lover in the beast. 

agenor's [[royal]] [[daughter]], as she plaid 
among the fields, the milk-white bull survey'd, 
and view'd his spotless [[body]] with delight, 
and at a distance kept him in her sight. 
at length she pluck'd the rising flow'rs, and fed 
the gentle beast, and fondly stroak'd his head. 
he stood well-pleas'd to touch the charming [[fair]], 
but hardly could confine his [[pleasure]] there. 
and now he wantons o'er the neighb'ring strand, 
now rowls his [[body]] on the yellow sand; 
and, now perceiving all her fears [[fear]] decay'd, 
comes tossing forward to the [[royal]] maid; 
gives her his breast to stroke, and downward turns 
his grizly brow, and gently stoops his horns. 
in flow'ry wreaths the [[royal]] virgin drest 
his bending horns, and kindly clapt his breast. 
'till now grown wanton and devoid of [[fear]], 
not knowing that she prest the thunderer, 
she plac'd her [[self]] upon his back, and rode 
o'er fields and meadows, seated on the [[god]]. 

he gently march'd along, and by degrees [[degree]] 
left the dry meadow, and approach'd the seas; 
where now he dips his hoofs and wets his thighs, 
now plunges in, and carries off the prize. 
the frighted [[nymph]] looks backward on the shoar, 
and hears the tumbling billows round her roar; 
but still she holds him fast: one hand is born 
upon his back; the other grasps a horn: 
her train of ruffling garments flies behind, 
swells in the air, and hovers in the wind. 

through storms and tempests he the virgin bore, 
and lands [[land]] her safe on the dictean shore; 
where now, in his divinest form array'd, 
in his true shape he captivates the maid; 
who gazes on him, and with wond'ring [[eyes]] 
beholds the new majestick figure rise, 
his glowing features, and celestial [[light]], 
and all the [[god]] discover'd to her sight.

book the third

the story of of cadmus 

when now agenor had his [[daughter]] lost, 
he sent his [[son]] to search on ev'ry coast; 
and sternly bid him to his arms restore 
the darling maid, or see his face no more, 
but [[live]] an [[exile]] in a [[foreign]] clime; 
thus was the [[father]] pious to a crime. 
the restless [[youth]] search'd all the [[world]] around; 
but how can jove in his amours be found? 
when, tir'd at length with unsuccessful toil, 
to shun his angry sire and native soil, 
he goes a suppliant to the delphick dome; 
there asks the [[god]] what new appointed [[home]] 
should end his wand'rings, and his toils relieve. 
the delphick oracles this [[answer]] give. 

"behold among the fields a lonely cow, 
unworn with yokes, unbroken to the plow; 
mark well the place where first she lays her down, 
there measure out thy walls, and build thy town, 
and from thy guide boeotia call the [[land]], 
in which the destin'd walls and town shall stand." 

no sooner had he left the dark abode, 
big with the promise of the delphick [[god]], 
when in the fields the fatal cow he view'd, 
nor gall'd with yokes, nor worn with servitude: 
her gently at a distance he pursu'd; 
and as he walk'd aloof, in [[silence]] pray'd 
to the [[great]] pow'r whose counsels he obey'd. 
her way thro' flow'ry panope she took, 
and now, cephisus, cross'd thy silver brook; 
when to the heav'ns her spacious front she rais'd, 
and bellow'd thrice, then backward turning gaz'd 
on those behind, 'till on the destin'd place 
she stoop'd, and couch'd amid the rising grass. 

cadmus salutes the soil, and gladly hails 
the new-found mountains, and the nameless vales, 
and thanks the gods, and turns about his eye 
to see his new dominions round him lye; 
then sends his servants to a neighb'ring grove 
for living streams, a [[sacrifice]] to jove. 
o'er the wide plain there rose a shady wood 
of aged trees; in its dark bosom stood 
a bushy thicket, pathless and unworn, 
o'er-run with brambles, and perplex'd with thorn: 
amidst the brake a hollow den was found, 
with rocks and shelving arches vaulted round. 

deep in the dreary den, conceal'd from day, 
sacred to [[mars]], a mighty dragon lay, 
bloated with poison to a monstrous size; 
fire broke in flashes when he glanc'd his [[eyes]]: 
his tow'ring crest was glorious to behold, 
his shoulders and his sides were scal'd with gold; 
three tongues he brandish'd when he charg'd his foes; 
his teeth stood jaggy in three dreadful rowes. 
the tyrians in the den for water sought, 
and with their urns explor'd the hollow vault: 
from side to side their empty urns rebound, 
and rowse the sleeping serpent with the sound. 
strait he bestirs him, and is seen to rise; 
and now with dreadful hissings fills the skies [[sky]], 
and darts his forky tongues, and rowles his glaring [[eyes]].

the tyrians drop their vessels in the fright, 
all pale and trembling at the hideous sight. 
spire above spire uprear'd in air he stood, 
and gazing round him over-look'd the wood: 
then floating on the ground in circles rowl'd; 
then leap'd upon them in a mighty fold. 
of such a bulk, and such a monstrous size 
the serpent in the polar circle lyes, 
that stretches over half the northern skies [[sky]]. 
in [[vain]] the tyrians on their arms rely, 
in [[vain]] attempt to [[fight]], in [[vain]] to fly: 
all their endeavours and their hopes [[hope]] are [[vain]]; 
some [[die]] entangled in the winding train; 
some are devour'd, or [[feel]] a loathsom [[death]], 
swoln up with blasts of pestilential breath. 

and now the scorching sun was mounted high, 
in all its lustre, to the noon-day [[sky]]; 
when, anxious for his [[friends]], and fill'd with cares [[care]], 
to search the woods th' impatient [[chief]] prepares. 
a lion's hide around his loins he wore, 
the well poiz'd javelin to the field he bore, 
inur'd to [[blood]]; the far-destroying dart; 
and, the [[best]] weapon, an undaunted [[heart]]. 

soon as the [[youth]] approach'd the fatal place, 
he saw his servants breathless on the grass; 
the scaly foe amid their corps he view'd, 
basking at ease, and feasting in their [[blood]]. 
"such [[friends]]," he cries, "deserv'd a longer date; 
but cadmus will [[revenge]] or share their [[fate]]." 
then heav'd a stone, and rising to the throw, 
he sent it in a whirlwind at the foe: 
a tow'r, assaulted by so rude a stroke, 
with all its lofty battlements had shook; 
but nothing here th' unwieldy rock avails, 
rebounding harmless from the plaited scales, 
that, firmly join'd, preserv'd him from a wound, 
with native armour crusted all around. 
with more [[success]], the dart unerring flew, 
which at his back the raging warriour threw; 
amid the plaited scales it took its course, 
and in the spinal marrow spent its [[force]]. 
the monster hiss'd aloud, and rag'd in [[vain]], 
and writh'd his [[body]] to and fro with [[pain]]; 
he bit the dart, and wrench'd the wood away; 
the point still buried in the marrow lay. 
and now his rage, increasing with his [[pain]], 
reddens his [[eyes]], and beats in ev'ry vein; 
churn'd in his teeth the foamy venom rose, 
whilst from his mouth a blast of vapours flows, 
such as th' infernal stygian waters cast. 
the plants around him wither in the blast. 
now in a maze of rings he lies [[lie]] enrowl'd, 
now all unravel'd, and without a fold; 
now, like a torrent, with a mighty [[force]] 
bears down the forest in his boist'rous course. 
cadmus gave back, and on the lion's spoil 
sustain'd the shock, then forc'd him to recoil; 
the pointed jav'lin warded off his rage: 
mad with his pains [[pain]], and furious to engage, 
the serpent champs the steel, and bites the spear, 
'till [[blood]] and venom all the point besmear. 
but still the hurt he yet receiv'd was slight; 
for, whilst the champion with redoubled might 
strikes [[home]] the jav'lin, his retiring foe 
shrinks from the wound, and disappoints the blow. 

the dauntless heroe still pursues his stroke, 
and presses forward, 'till a knotty oak 
retards his foe, and stops him in the rear; 
full in his throat he plung'd the fatal spear, 
that in th' extended neck a passage found, 
and pierc'd the solid timber through the wound. 
fix'd to the reeling trunk, with many a stroke 
of his huge tail he lash'd the sturdy oak; 
'till spent with toil, and lab'ring hard for breath, 
he now lay twisting in the pangs of [[death]]. 

cadmus beheld him wallow in a flood 
of swimming poison, intermix'd with [[blood]]; 
when suddenly a [[speech]] was heard from high 
(the [[speech]] was heard, nor was the speaker nigh), 
"why dost thou thus with secret [[pleasure]] see, 
insulting man! what thou thy [[self]] shalt be?" 
astonish'd at the voice, he stood amaz'd, 
and all around with inward [[horror]] gaz'd: 
when pallas swift descending from the skies [[sky]], 
pallas, the guardian of the bold and [[wise]], 
bids him plow up the field, and scatter round 
the dragon's teeth o'er all the furrow'd ground; 
then tells the [[youth]] how to his wond'ring [[eyes]] 
embattled armies [[army]] from the field should rise. 

he sows the teeth at pallas's command, 
and flings the future [[people]] from his hand. 
the clods grow warm, and crumble where he sows; 
and now the pointed spears advance in rows; 
now nodding plumes appear, and shining crests, 
now the broad shoulders and the rising breasts; 
o'er all the field the breathing harvest swarms, 
a growing host, a crop of [[men]] and arms. 

so through the parting stage a figure rears 
its [[body]] up, and limb by limb appears 
by just degrees [[degree]]; 'till all the [[man]] arise, 
and in his full proportion strikes the [[eyes]]. 

cadmus surpriz'd, and startled at the sight 
of his new foes, prepar'd himself for [[fight]]: 
when one cry'd out, "forbear, fond [[man]], forbear 
to mingle in a blind promiscuous [[war]]." 
this said, he struck his [[brother]] to the ground, 
himself expiring by another's wound; 
nor did the third his [[conquest]] long survive, 
dying ere scarce he had begun to [[live]]. 

the dire [[example]] ran through all the field, 
'till heaps of brothers [[brother]] were by brothers [[brother]] kill'd; 
the furrows swam in [[blood]]: and only five 
of all the vast increase were left alive. 
echion one, at pallas's command, 
let fall the guiltless weapon from his hand, 
and with the rest a peaceful treaty makes, 
whom cadmus as his [[friends]] and partners takes; 
so founds a [[city]] on the promis'd [[earth]], 
and gives his new boeotian [[empire]] birth. 

here cadmus reign'd; and now one would have guess'd 
the [[royal]] founder in his [[exile]] blest: 
long did he [[live]] within his new abodes, 
ally'd by [[marriage]] to the deathless gods; 
and, in a fruitful wife's embraces old, 
a long increase of children's [[children]] told: 
but no frail [[man]], however [[great]] or high, 
can be concluded blest before he [[die]]. 

actaeon was the first of all his [[race]], 
who griev'd his grandsire in his borrow'd face; 
condemn'd by stern diana to bemoan 
the branching horns, and visage not his own; 
to shun his once lov'd dogs, to bound away, 
and from their huntsman to become their prey, 
and yet consider why the [[change]] was wrought, 
you'll find it his misfortune, not his [[fault]]; 
or, if a [[fault]], it was the [[fault]] of [[chance]]: 
for how can guilt proceed from ignorance? 

the transformation of actaeon into a stag 

in a [[fair]] chace a shady mountain stood, 
well stor'd with game, and mark'd with trails of [[blood]]; 
here did the huntsmen, 'till the heat of day, 
pursue the stag, and load themselves with rey: 
when thus actaeon calling to the rest: 
"my [[friends]]," said he, "our [[sport]] is at the [[best]], 
the sun is high advanc'd, and downward sheds 
his burning beams directly on our heads; 
then by [[consent]] abstain from further spoils, 
call off the dogs, and gather up the toils, 
and ere to-morrow's sun begins his [[race]], 
take the cool morning to renew the chace." 
they all [[consent]], and in a chearful train 
the jolly huntsmen, loaden with the slain, 
return in triumph from the sultry plain. 

down in a vale with pine and cypress clad, 
refresh'd with gentle winds, and brown with shade, 
the chaste diana's private haunt, there stood 
full in the centre of the darksome wood 
a spacious grotto, all around o'er-grown 
with hoary moss, and arch'd with pumice-stone. 
from out its rocky clefts the waters flow, 
and trickling swell into a lake below. 
nature had ev'ry where so plaid her part, 
that ev'ry where she seem'd to vie with art [[arts]]. 
here the bright [[goddess]], toil'd and chaf'd with heat, 
was wont to bathe her in the cool retreat. 

here did she now with all her train resort, 
panting with heat, and breathless from the [[sport]]; 
her armour-bearer laid her bow aside, 
some loos'd her sandals, some her veil unty'd; 
each busy [[nymph]] her proper part undrest; 
while crocale, more handy than the rest, 
gather'd her flowing hair, and in a noose 
bound it together, whilst her own hung loose. 
five of the more ignoble sort by turns 
fetch up the water, and unlade the urns. 

now all undrest the shining [[goddess]] stood, 
when [[young]] actaeon, wilder'd in the wood, 
to the cool grott by his hard [[fate]] betray'd, 
the fountains fill'd with naked nymphs [[nymph]] survey'd. 
the frighted virgins shriek'd at the surprize 
(the forest echo'd with their piercing cries). 
then in a huddle round their [[goddess]] prest: 
she, proudly eminent above the rest, 
with blushes glow'd; such blushes as adorn 
the ruddy welkin, or the purple morn; 
and tho' the crowding nymphs [[nymph]] her [[body]] hide, 
half backward shrunk, and view'd him from a side. 
surpriz'd, at first she would have snatch'd her bow, 
but sees the circling waters round her flow; 
these in the hollow of her hand she took, 
and dash'd 'em in his face, while thus she spoke: 
"tell, if thou can'st, the wond'rous sight disclos'd, 
a [[goddess]] naked to thy view expos'd." 

this said, the [[man]] begun to disappear 
by slow degrees [[degree]], and ended in a deer. 
a rising horn on either brow he wears, 
and stretches out his neck, and pricks his ears; 
rough is his skin, with sudden hairs o'er-grown, 
his bosom pants with fears [[fear]] before unknown: 
transform'd at length, he flies away in haste, 
and wonders why he flies away so fast. 
but as by [[chance]], within a neighb'ring brook, 
he saw his branching horns and alter'd look. 
wretched actaeon! in a doleful tone 
he try'd to speak, but only gave a groan; 
and as he wept, within the watry glass 
he saw the big round drops, with silent pace, 
run trickling down a savage hairy face. 
what should he do? or seek his old abodes, 
or herd among the deer, and sculk in woods! 
here shame dissuades him, there his [[fear]] prevails, 
and each by turns his aking [[heart]] assails. 

as he thus ponders, he behind him spies 
his op'ning hounds, and now he hears their cries: 
a gen'rous pack, or to maintain the chace, 
or snuff the vapour from the scented grass. 

he bounded off with [[fear]], and swiftly ran 
o'er craggy mountains, and the flow'ry plain; 
through brakes and thickets forc'd his way, and flew 
through many a ring, where once he did pursue. 
in [[vain]] he oft endeavour'd to proclaim 
his new misfortune, and to tell his name; 
nor voice nor words the brutal tongue supplies; 
from shouting [[men]], and horns, and dogs he flies, 
deafen'd and stunn'd with their promiscuous cries. 
when now the fleetest of the pack, that prest 
close at his heels, and sprung before the rest, 
had fasten'd on him, straight another pair, 
hung on his wounded haunch, and held him there, 
'till all the pack came up, and ev'ry hound 
tore the [[sad]] huntsman grov'ling on the ground, 
who now appear'd but one continu'd wound. 
with dropping tears his bitter [[fate]] he moans, 
and fills the mountain with his dying groans. 
his servants with a piteous look he spies, 
and turns about his supplicating [[eyes]]. 
his servants, ignorant of what had chanc'd, 
with eager haste and joyful shouts advanc'd, 
and call'd their [[lord]] actaeon to the game. 
he shook his head in [[answer]] to the name; 
he heard, but wish'd he had indeed been gone, 
or only to have stood a looker-on. 
but to his [[grief]] he finds himself too near, 
and feels [[feel]] his rav'nous dogs with fury tear 
their wretched master panting in a deer. 

the birth of bacchus 

actaeon's suff'rings, and diana's rage, 
did all the thoughts [[thought]] of [[men]] and gods engage; 
some call'd the evils [[evil]] which diana wrought, 
too [[great]], and disproportion'd to the [[fault]]: 
others again, esteem'd actaeon's woes 
fit for a virgin [[goddess]] to impose. 
the hearers into diff'rent parts divide, 
and reasons [[reason]] are produc'd on either side. 

juno alone, of all that heard the news, 
nor would condemn the [[goddess]], nor excuse: 
she heeded not the [[justice]] of the deed, 
but joy'd to see the [[race]] of cadmus bleed; 
for still she kept europa in her [[mind]], 
and, for her sake, detested all her [[kind]]. 
besides, to aggravate her hate, she heard 
how semele, to jove's embrace preferr'd, 
was now grown big with an [[immortal]] load, 
and carry'd in her womb a future [[god]]. 
thus terribly incens'd, the [[goddess]] broke 
to sudden fury, and abruptly spoke. 

"are my reproaches of so small a [[force]]? 
'tis [[time]] i then pursue another course: 
it is decreed the guilty wretch shall [[die]], 
if i'm indeed the mistress of the [[sky]], 
if rightly styl'd among the pow'rs above 
the [[wife]] and sister of the thund'ring jove 
(and none can sure a sister's [[right]] deny); 
it is decreed the guilty wretch shall [[die]]. 
she boasts an [[honour]] i can hardly claim, 
pregnant she rises to a mother's name; 
while proud and [[vain]] she triumphs in her jove, 
and shows the glorious tokens of his [[love]]: 
but if i'm still the mistress of the skies [[sky]], 
by her own lover the fond [[beauty]] dies." 
this said, descending in a yellow cloud, 
before the gates of semele she stood. 

old beroe's decrepit shape she wears, 
her wrinkled visage, and her hoary hairs; 
whilst in her trembling gait she totters on, 
and learns to tattle in the nurse's tone. 
the [[goddess]], thus disguis'd in [[age]], beguil'd 
with pleasing stories her false foster-child. 
much did she talk of [[love]], and when she came 
to mention to the [[nymph]] her lover's name, 
fetching a sigh, and holding down her head, 
"'tis well," says she, "if all be true that's said. 
but trust me, child, i'm much inclin'd to [[fear]] 
some counterfeit in this your [[jupiter]]: 
many an honest well-designing maid 
has been by these pretended gods betray'd, 
but if he be indeed the thund'ring jove, 
bid him, when next he courts the rites of [[love]], 
descend triumphant from th' etherial [[sky]], 
in all the pomp of his divinity, 
encompass'd round by those celestial charms, 
with which he fills th' [[immortal]] juno's arms." 

th' unwary [[nymph]], ensnar'd with what she said, 
desir'd of jove, when next he sought her bed, 
to grant a [[certain]] gift which she would chuse; 
"fear not," reply'd the [[god]], "that i'll refuse 
whate'er you ask: may styx confirm my voice, 
chuse what you will, and you shall have your [[choice]]." 
"then," says the [[nymph]], "when next you seek my arms, 
may you descend in those celestial charms, 
with which your juno's bosom you enflame, 
and fill with transport heav'n's [[immortal]] dame." 
the [[god]] surpriz'd would fain have stopp'd her voice, 
but he had sworn, and she had made her [[choice]]. 

to keep his promise he ascends, and shrowds 
his awful brow in whirl-winds and in clouds; 
whilst all around, in terrible array, 
his thunders rattle, and his light'nings play. 
and yet, the dazling lustre to abate, 
he set not out in all his pomp and [[state]], 
clad in the mildest light'ning of the skies [[sky]], 
and arm'd with thunder of the smallest size: 
not those huge bolts, by which the giants slain 
lay overthrown on the phlegrean plain. 
'twas of a lesser mould, and lighter weight; 
they call it thunder of a second-rate, 
for the rough cyclops, who by jove's command 
temper'd the bolt, and turn'd it to his hand, 
work'd up less flame and fury in its make, 
and quench'd it sooner in the standing lake. 
thus dreadfully adorn'd, with [[horror]] bright, 
th' illustrious [[god]], descending from his height, 
came rushing on her in a storm of [[light]]. 

the mortal dame, too feeble to engage 
the lightning's flashes, and the thunder's rage, 
consum'd amidst the glories she desir'd, 
and in the terrible embrace expir'd. 

but, to preserve his offspring from the tomb, 
jove took him smoaking from the blasted womb: 
and, if on ancient tales we may rely, 
inclos'd th' abortive infant in his thigh. 
here when the babe had all his [[time]] fulfill'd, 
ino first took him for her foster-child; 
then the niseans, in their dark abode, 
nurs'd secretly with milk the thriving [[god]]. 

the transformation of tiresias 

'twas now, while these transactions [[past]] on [[earth]], 
and bacchus thus procur'd a second birth, 
when jove, dispos'd to lay aside the weight 
of publick [[empire]] and the cares [[care]] of [[state]], 
as to his queen in nectar bowls he quaff'd, 
"in troth," says he, and as he spoke he laugh'd, 
"the sense of [[pleasure]] in the male is far 
more dull and [[dead]], than what you females share." 
juno the [[truth]] of what was said deny'd; 
tiresias therefore must the cause decide, 
for he the [[pleasure]] of each [[sex]] had try'd. 

it happen'd once, within a shady wood, 
two twisted snakes he in conjunction view'd, 
when with his staff their slimy folds he broke, 
and lost his manhood at the fatal stroke. 
but, after seven revolving years, he view'd 
the self-same serpents in the self-same wood: 
"and if," says he, "such [[virtue]] in you lye, 
that he who dares your slimy folds untie 
must [[change]] his [[kind]], a second stroke i'll try." 
again he struck the snakes, and stood again 
new-sex'd, and strait recover'd into [[man]]. 
him therefore both the deities create 
the sov'raign umpire, in their grand debate; 
and he declar'd for jove: when juno fir'd, 
more than so trivial an affair requir'd, 
depriv'd him, in her fury, of his sight, 
and left him groping round in sudden night. 
but jove (for so it is in heav'n decreed, 
that no one [[god]] repeal another's deed) 
irradiates all his [[soul]] with inward [[light]], 
and with the prophet's art [[arts]] relieves the want of sight. 

the transformation of echo 

fam'd far and near for knowing things to come, 
from him th' enquiring nations sought their doom; 
the [[fair]] liriope his answers [[answer]] try'd, 
and first th' unerring [[prophet]] justify'd. 
this [[nymph]] the [[god]] cephisus had abus'd, 
with all his winding waters circumfus'd, 
and on the nereid got a lovely boy, 
whom the soft maids ev'n then beheld with joy. 

the tender dame, sollicitous to [[know]] 
whether her child should reach old [[age]] or no, 
consults the sage tiresias, who replies, 
"if e'er he knows [[know]] himself he surely dies." 
long liv'd the dubious [[mother]] in suspence, 
'till [[time]] unriddled all the prophet's sense. 

narcissus now his sixteenth year began, 
just turn'd of boy, and on the verge of [[man]]; 
many a friend the blooming [[youth]] caress'd, 
many a love-sick maid her flame confess'd: 
such was his [[pride]], in [[vain]] the friend caress'd, 
the love-sick maid in [[vain]] her flame confess'd. 

once, in the woods, as he pursu'd the chace, 
the babbling echo had descry'd his face; 
she, who in others' words her [[silence]] breaks, 
nor speaks her [[self]] but when another speaks. 
echo was then a maid, of [[speech]] bereft, 
of wonted [[speech]]; for tho' her voice was left, 
juno a curse did on her tongue impose, 
to [[sport]] with ev'ry sentence in the close. 
full often when the [[goddess]] might have caught 
jove and her rivals in the very [[fault]], 
this [[nymph]] with subtle stories would delay 
her coming, 'till the lovers slip'd away. 
the [[goddess]] found out the deceit in [[time]], 
and then she cry'd, "that tongue, for this thy crime, 
which could so many subtle tales [[produce]], 
shall be hereafter but of little use." 
hence 'tis she prattles in a fainter tone, 
with mimick sounds, and accents not her own. 

this love-sick virgin, over-joy'd to find 
the boy alone, still follow'd him behind: 
when glowing warmly at her near approach, 
as sulphur blazes at the taper's touch, 
she long'd her hidden passion to reveal, 
and tell her pains [[pain]], but had not words to tell: 
she can't begin, but waits for the rebound, 
to catch his voice, and to return the sound. 

the [[nymph]], when nothing could narcissus move, 
still dash'd with blushes for her slighted [[love]], 
liv'd in the shady covert of the woods, 
in solitary caves and dark abodes; 
where pining wander'd the rejected [[fair]], 
'till harrass'd out, and worn away with [[care]], 
the sounding skeleton, of [[blood]] bereft, 
besides her bones and voice had nothing left. 
her bones are petrify'd, her voice is found 
in vaults, where still it doubles ev'ry sound. 

the story of narcissus 

thus did the nymphs [[nymph]] in [[vain]] caress the boy, 
he still was lovely, but he still was coy; 
when one [[fair]] virgin of the slighted train 
thus pray'd the gods, provok'd by his disdain, 
"oh may he [[love]] like me, and [[love]] like me in vain!" 
rhamnusia pity'd the neglected [[fair]], 
and with just vengeance answer'd to her pray'r. 

there stands a fountain in a darksom wood, 
nor stain'd with falling leaves nor rising mud; 
untroubled by the breath of winds it rests, 
unsully'd by the touch of [[men]] or beasts; 
high bow'rs of shady trees above it grow, 
and rising grass and chearful greens below. 
pleas'd with the form and coolness of the place, 
and over-heated by the morning chace, 
narcissus on the grassie verdure lyes: 
but whilst within the chrystal fount he tries 
to quench his heat, he feels [[feel]] new heats arise. 
for as his own bright image he survey'd, 
he fell in [[love]] with the fantastick shade; 
and o'er the [[fair]] resemblance hung unmov'd, 
nor knew, fond youth! it was himself he lov'd. 
the well-turn'd neck and shoulders he descries, 
the spacious forehead, and the sparkling [[eyes]]; 
the hands that bacchus might not scorn to show, 
and hair that round apollo's head might flow; 
with all the purple youthfulness of face, 
that gently blushes in the wat'ry glass. 
by his own flames consum'd the lover lyes, 
and gives himself the wound by which he dies. 
to the cold water oft he joins his lips, 
oft catching at the beauteous shade he dips 
his arms, as often from himself he slips. 
nor knows [[know]] he who it is his arms pursue 
with eager clasps, but loves [[love]] he knows [[know]] not who. 

what could, fond [[youth]], this helpless passion move? 
what kindled in thee this unpity'd [[love]]? 
thy own warm blush within the water glows, 
with thee the colour'd shadow comes and goes, 
its empty being on thy [[self]] relies; 
step thou aside, and the frail charmer dies. 

still o'er the fountain's wat'ry gleam he stood, 
mindless of sleep, and negligent of food; 
still view'd his face, and languish'd as he view'd. 
at length he rais'd his head, and thus began 
to vent his griefs, and tell the woods his [[pain]]. 
"you trees," says he, "and thou surrounding grove, 
who oft have been the kindly scenes of [[love]], 
tell me, if e'er within your shades did lye 
a [[youth]] so tortur'd, so perplex'd as i? 
i, who before me see the charming [[fair]], 
whilst there he stands, and yet he stands not there: 
in such a maze of [[love]] my thoughts [[thought]] are lost: 
and yet no bulwark'd town, nor distant coast, 
preserves the beauteous [[youth]] from being seen, 
no mountains rise, nor oceans flow between. 
a shallow water hinders my embrace; 
and yet the lovely mimick wears a face 
that kindly smiles, and when i bend to join 
my lips to his, he fondly bends to mine. 
hear, gentle [[youth]], and [[pity]] my complaint, 
come from thy well, thou [[fair]] inhabitant. 
my charms an easy [[conquest]] have obtain'd 
o'er other hearts [[heart]], by thee alone disdain'd. 
but why should i despair? i'm sure he burns 
with [[equal]] flames, and languishes by turns. 
when-e'er i stoop, he offers at a kiss, 
and when my arms i stretch, he stretches his. 
his eye with [[pleasure]] on my face he keeps, 
he smiles my smiles, and when i weep he weeps. 
when e'er i speak, his moving lips appear 
to utter something, which i cannot hear. 

"ah wretched me! i now begin too late 
to find out all the long-perplex'd deceit; 
it is my [[self]] i [[love]], my [[self]] i see; 
the [[gay]] delusion is a part of me. 
i kindle up the fires [[fire]] by which i burn, 
and my own beauties [[beauty]] from the well return. 
whom should i court? how utter my complaint? 
enjoyment but produces [[produce]] my restraint, 
and too much plenty makes me [[die]] for want. 
how gladly would i from my [[self]] remove! 
and at a distance set the thing i [[love]]. 
my breast is warm'd with such unusual [[fire]], 
i [[wish]] him absent whom i most [[desire]]. 
and now i faint with [[grief]]; my [[fate]] draws nigh; 
in all the [[pride]] of blooming [[youth]] i [[die]]. 
death will the sorrows [[sorrow]] of my [[heart]] relieve. 
oh might the visionary [[youth]] survive, 
i should with joy my latest breath resign! 
but oh! i see his [[fate]] involv'd in mine." 

this said, the weeping [[youth]] again return'd 
to the clear fountain, where again he burn'd; 
his tears defac'd the surface of the well, 
with circle after circle, as they fell: 
and now the lovely face but half appears, 
o'er-run with wrinkles, and deform'd with tears. 
"ah whither," cries narcissus, "dost thou fly? 
let me still feed the flame by which i [[die]]; 
let me still see, tho' i'm no further blest." 
then rends his garment off, and beats his breast: 
his naked bosom redden'd with the blow, 
in such a blush as purple clusters show, 
ere yet the sun's autumnal heats refine 
their sprightly juice, and mellow it to wine. 
the glowing beauties [[beauty]] of his breast he spies, 
and with a new redoubled passion dies. 
as wax dissolves, as ice begins to run, 
and trickle into drops before the sun; 
so melts the [[youth]], and languishes away, 
his [[beauty]] withers, and his limbs decay; 
and none of those attractive charms remain, 
to which the slighted echo su'd in [[vain]]. 

she saw him in his [[present]] misery, 
whom, spight of all her wrongs [[wrong]], she griev'd to see. 
she answer'd sadly to the lover's moan, 
sigh'd back his sighs, and groan'd to ev'ry groan: 
"ah youth! belov'd in [[vain]]," narcissus cries; 
"ah youth! belov'd in [[vain]]," the [[nymph]] replies. 
"farewel," says he; the parting sound scarce fell 
from his faint lips, but she reply'd, "farewel." 
then on th' wholsome [[earth]] he gasping lyes, 
'till [[death]] shuts up those self-admiring [[eyes]]. 
to the cold shades his flitting ghost retires, 
and in the stygian waves it [[self]] admires. 

for him the naiads and the dryads mourn, 
whom the [[sad]] echo answers [[answer]] in her turn; 
and now the sister-nymphs prepare his urn: 
when, looking for his corps, they only found 
a rising stalk, with yellow blossoms crown'd. 

the story of pentheus 

this [[sad]] event gave blind tiresias fame, 
through greece establish'd in a prophet's name. 

th' unhallow'd pentheus only durst deride 
the cheated [[people]], and their eyeless guide. 
to whom the [[prophet]] in his fury said, 
shaking the hoary honours [[honour]] of his head: 
"'twere well, presumptuous [[man]], 'twere well for thee 
if thou wert eyeless too, and blind, like me: 
for the [[time]] comes, nay, 'tis already here, 
when the [[young]] god's solemnities appear: 
which, if thou dost not with just rites adorn, 
thy impious carcass, into pieces torn, 
shall strew the woods, and hang on ev'ry thorn. 
then, then, [[remember]] what i now foretel, 
and own the blind tiresias saw too well." 

still pentheus scorns him, and derides his [[skill]]; 
but [[time]] did all the prophet's threats fulfil. 
for now through prostrate greece [[young]] bacchus rode, 
whilst howling matrons celebrate the [[god]]: 
all ranks and sexes [[sex]] to his orgies ran, 
to mingle in the pomps, and fill the train. 
when pentheus thus his wicked rage express'd: 
"what madness, thebans, has your souls [[soul]] possess'd? 
can hollow timbrels, can a drunken shout, 
and the lewd clamours of a beastly rout, 
thus quell your [[courage]]; can the [[weak]] alarm 
of women's yells those stubborn souls [[soul]] disarm, 
whom nor the [[sword]] nor trumpet e'er could fright, 
nor the loud din and [[horror]] of a [[fight]]? 
and you, our sires, who left your old abodes, 
and fix'd in [[foreign]] [[earth]] your [[country]] gods; 
will you without a stroak your [[city]] yield, 
and poorly quit an undisputed field? 
but you, whose [[youth]] and vigour should inspire 
heroick warmth, and kindle martial [[fire]], 
whom burnish'd arms and crested helmets grace, 
not flow'ry garlands and a painted face; 
remember him to whom you stand ally'd: 
the serpent for his well of waters dy'd. 
he fought the [[strong]]; do you his [[courage]] show, 
and gain a [[conquest]] o'er a feeble foe. 
if thebes must fall, oh might the fates [[fate]] afford 
a nobler doom from famine, [[fire]], or [[sword]]. 
then might the thebans perish with renown: 
but now a beardless victor sacks the town; 
whom nor the prancing steed, nor pond'rous shield, 
nor the hack'd helmet, nor the dusty field, 
but the soft joys of luxury and ease, 
the purple vests, and flow'ry garlands please. 
stand then aside, i'll make the counterfeit 
renounce his god-head, and confess the [[cheat]]. 
acrisius from the grecian walls repell'd 
this boasted pow'r; why then should pentheus yield? 
go quickly drag th' impostor boy to me; 
i'll try the [[force]] of his divinity." 
thus did th' audacious wretch those rites profane; 
his [[friends]] dissuade th' audacious wretch in [[vain]]: 
in [[vain]] his grandsire urg'd him to give o'er 
his impious threats; the wretch but raves the more. 

so have i seen a river gently glide, 
in a smooth course, and inoffensive tide; 
but if with dams its current we restrain, 
it bears down all, and foams along the plain. 

but now his servants came besmear'd with [[blood]], 
sent by their haughty [[prince]] to seize the [[god]]; 
the [[god]] they found not in the frantick throng, 
but dragg'd a zealous votary along. 

the mariners transform'd to dolphins 

him pentheus view'd with fury in his look, 
and scarce with-held his hands, whilst thus he spoke: 
"vile slave! whom speedy vengeance shall pursue, 
and terrify thy base seditious crew: 
thy [[country]] and thy parentage reveal, 
and, why thou joinest in these mad orgies, tell." 

the captive views him with undaunted [[eyes]], 
and, arm'd with inward innocence, replies, 

"from high meonia's rocky shores i came, 
of [[poor]] descent, acoetes is my name: 
my sire was meanly born; no oxen plow'd 
his fruitful fields, nor in his pastures low'd. 
his whole estate within the waters lay; 
with lines and hooks he caught the finny prey, 
his art [[arts]] was all his livelyhood; which he 
thus with his dying lips bequeath'd to me: 
in streams, my boy, and rivers take thy [[chance]]; 
there swims, said he, thy whole [[inheritance]]. 
long did i [[live]] on this [[poor]] legacy; 
'till tir'd with rocks, and my old native [[sky]], 
to [[arts]] of navigation i inclin'd; 
observ'd the turns and changes [[change]] of the wind, 
learn'd the fit havens, and began to note 
the stormy hyades, the rainy goat, 
the bright taygete, and the shining bears, 
with all the sailor's catalogue of stars. 

"once, as by [[chance]] for delos i design'd, 
my vessel, driv'n by a [[strong]] gust of wind, 
moor'd in a chian creek; a-shore i went, 
and all the following night in chios spent. 
when morning rose, i sent my mates to bring 
supplies of water from a neighb'ring spring, 
whilst i the motion of the winds explor'd; 
then summon'd in my crew, and went aboard. 
opheltes heard my summons, and with joy 
brought to the shore a soft and lovely boy, 
with more than female sweetness in his look, 
whom straggling in the neighb'ring fields he took. 
with fumes of wine the little captive glows, 
and nods with sleep, and staggers as he goes. 

"i view'd him nicely, and began to trace 
each heav'nly feature, each [[immortal]] grace, 
and saw divinity in all his face, 
i [[know]] not who, said i, this [[god]] should be; 
but that he is a [[god]] i plainly see: 
and thou, who-e'er thou art [[arts]], excuse the [[force]] 
these [[men]] have us'd; and oh befriend our course! 
pray not for us, the nimble dictys cry'd, 
dictys, that could the main-top mast bestride, 
and down the ropes with active vigour slide. 
to the same [[purpose]] old epopeus spoke, 
who over-look'd the oars, and tim'd the stroke; 
the same the pilot, and the same the rest; 
such impious avarice their souls [[soul]] possest. 
nay, heav'n forbid that i should bear away 
within my vessel so [[divine]] a prey, 
said i; and stood to hinder their intent: 
when lycabas, a wretch for murder sent 
from tuscany, to suffer [[banishment]], 
with his clench'd fist had struck me over-board, 
had not my hands in falling grasp'd a cord. 

"his base confederates the [[fact]] approve; 
when bacchus (for 'twas he) begun to move, 
wak'd by the noise and clamours which they rais'd; 
and shook his drowsie limbs, and round him gaz'd: 
what means this noise? he cries; am i betray'd? 
ah, whither, whither must i be convey'd? 
fear not, said proreus, child, but tell us where 
you [[wish]] to [[land]], and trust our friendly [[care]]. 
to naxos then direct your course, said he; 
naxos a hospitable port shall be 
to each of you, a joyful [[home]] to me. 
by ev'ry [[god]], that rules [[rule]] the sea or [[sky]], 
the perjur'd villains promise to comply, 
and bid me hasten to unmoor the ship. 
with eager joy i launch into the deep; 
and, heedless of the fraud, for naxos stand. 
they whisper oft, and beckon with the hand, 
and give me signs, all anxious for their prey, 
to tack about, and steer another way. 
then let some other to my post succeed, 
said i, i'm guiltless of so foul a deed. 
what, says ethalion, must the ship's whole crew 
follow your [[humour]], and depend on you? 
and strait himself he seated at the prore, 
and tack'd about, and sought another shore. 

"the beauteous [[youth]] now found himself betray'd, 
and from the deck the rising waves survey'd, 
and seem'd to weep, and as he wept he said: 
and do you thus my easy [[faith]] beguile? 
thus do you bear me to my native isle? 
will such a multitude of [[men]] employ 
their [[strength]] against a [[weak]] defenceless boy? 

"in [[vain]] did i the god-like [[youth]] deplore, 
the more i begg'd, they thwarted me the more. 
and now by all the gods in heav'n that hear 
this solemn oath, by bacchus' [[self]], i swear, 
the mighty miracle that did ensue, 
although it seems beyond [[belief]], is true. 
the vessel, fix'd and rooted in the flood, 
unmov'd by all the beating billows stood. 
in [[vain]] the mariners would plow the main 
with sails unfurl'd, and strike their oars in [[vain]]; 
around their oars a twining ivy cleaves, 
and climbs the mast, and hides the cords in leaves: 
the sails are cover'd with a chearful green, 
and berries in the fruitful canvass seen. 
amidst the waves a sudden forest rears 
its verdant head, and a new spring appears. 

"the [[god]] we now behold with open'd [[eyes]]; 
a herd of spotted panthers round him lyes 
in glaring forms; the grapy clusters spread 
on his [[fair]] brows, and dangle on his head. 
and whilst he frowns, and brandishes his spear, 
my mates surpriz'd with madness or with [[fear]], 
leap'd over board; first perjur'd madon found 
rough scales and fins his stiff'ning sides surround; 
ah what, cries one, has thus transform'd thy look? 
strait his own mouth grew wider as he spoke; 
and now himself he views with like surprize. 
still at his oar th' industrious libys plies; 
but, as he plies, each busy arm shrinks in, 
and by degrees [[degree]] is fashion'd to a fin. 
another, as he catches at a cord, 
misses his arms, and, tumbling over-board, 
with his broad fins and forky tail he laves 
the rising surge, and flounces in the waves. 
thus all my crew transform'd around the ship, 
or dive below, or on the surface leap, 
and spout the waves, and wanton in the deep. 
full nineteen sailors did the ship convey, 
a shole of nineteen dolphins round her play. 
i only in my proper shape appear, 
speechless with wonder, and half [[dead]] with [[fear]], 
'till bacchus kindly bid me [[fear]] no more. 
with him i landed on the chian shore, 
and him shall ever gratefully adore." 

"this forging [[slave]]," says pentheus, "would prevail 
o'er our just fury by a far-fetch'd tale: 
go, let him [[feel]] the whips, the swords [[sword]], the [[fire]], 
and in the tortures of the rack expire." 
th' officious servants hurry him away, 
and the [[poor]] captive in a dungeon lay. 
but, whilst the whips and tortures are prepar'd, 
the gates fly open, of themselves unbarr'd; 
at [[liberty]] th' unfetter'd captive stands, 
and flings the loosen'd shackles from his hands. 

the [[death]] of pentheus 

but pentheus, grown more furious than before, 
resolv'd to send his messengers no more, 
but went himself to the distracted throng, 
where high cithaeron echo'd with their [[song]]. 
and as the fiery war-horse paws the ground, 
and snorts and trembles at the trumpet's sound; 
transported thus he heard the frantick rout, 
and rav'd and madden'd at the distant shout. 

a spacious circuit on the hill there stood. 
level and wide, and skirted round with wood; 
here the rash pentheus, with unhallow'd [[eyes]], 
the howling dames and mystick orgies spies. 
his [[mother]] sternly view'd him where he stood, 
and kindled into madness as she view'd: 
her leafy jav'lin at her [[son]] she cast, 
and cries, "the boar that lays our [[country]] waste! 
the boar, my sisters! aim the fatal dart, 
and strike the brindled monster to the [[heart]]." 

pentheus astonish'd heard the dismal sound, 
and sees the yelling matrons gath'ring round; 
he sees, and weeps at his approaching [[fate]], 
and begs for [[mercy]], and repents too late. 
"help, help! my aunt autonoe," he cry'd; 
"remember, how your own actaeon dy'd." 
deaf to his cries, the frantick matron crops 
one stretch'd-out arm, the other ino lops. 
in [[vain]] does pentheus to his [[mother]] sue, 
and the raw bleeding stumps presents [[present]] to view: 
his [[mother]] howl'd; and, heedless of his pray'r, 
her trembling hand she twisted in his hair, 
"and this," she cry'd, "shall be agave's share," 
when from the neck his struggling head she tore, 
and in her hands the ghastly visage bore. 
with [[pleasure]] all the hideous trunk survey; 
then pull'd and tore the mangled limbs away, 
as starting in the pangs of [[death]] it lay, 
soon as the wood its leafy honours [[honour]] casts, 
blown off and scatter'd by autumnal blasts, 
with such a sudden [[death]] lay pentheus slain, 
and in a thousand pieces strow'd the plain. 

by so distinguishing a [[judgment]] aw'd, 
the thebans tremble, and confess the [[god]]. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book the fourth

the story of alcithoe and her sisters 

yet still alcithoe perverse remains, 
and bacchus still, and all his rites, disdains. 
too rash, and madly bold, she bids him prove 
himself a [[god]], nor owns the [[son]] of jove. 
her sisters too unanimous agree, 
faithful associates in impiety. 
be this a solemn feast, the [[priest]] had said; 
be, with each mistress, unemploy'd each maid. 
with skins of beasts your tender limbs enclose, 
and with an ivy-crown adorn your brows, 
the leafy thyrsus high in triumph bear, 
and give your locks to wanton in the air. 

these rites profan'd, the holy seer foreshow'd 
a mourning [[people]], and a vengeful [[god]]. 

matrons and pious wives [[wife]] [[obedience]] show, 
distaffs, and wooll, half spun, away they throw: 
then incense burn, and, bacchus, thee adore, 
or lov'st thou nyseus, or lyaeus more? 
o! doubly got, o! doubly born, they sung, 
thou mighty bromius, hail, from light'ning sprung! 
hail, thyon, eleleus! each name is thine: 
or, listen parent of the genial vine! 
iachus! evan! loudly they repeat, 
and not one grecian attribute forget, 
which to thy [[praise]], [[great]] deity, belong, 
stil'd justly liber in the roman [[song]]. 
eternity of [[youth]] is thine! enjoy 
years roul'd on years, yet still a blooming boy. 
in heav'n thou shin'st with a superior grace; 
conceal thy horns, and 'tis a virgin's face. 
thou taught'st the tawny [[indian]] to obey, 
and ganges, smoothly flowing, own'd thy sway. 
lycurgus, pentheus, equally profane, 
by thy just vengeance equally were slain. 
by thee the tuscans, who conspir'd to keep 
thee captive, plung'd, and cut with finns the deep. 
with painted reins, all-glitt'ring from afar, 
the spotted lynxes proudly draw thy car. 
around, the bacchae, and the satyrs throng; 
behind, silenus, drunk, lags slow along: 
on his dull ass he nods from side to side, 
forbears to fall, yet half forgets to ride. 
still at thy near approach, applauses loud 
are heard, with yellings of the female crowd. 
timbrels, and boxen pipes, with mingled cries, 
swell up in sounds confus'd, and rend the skies [[sky]]. 
come, bacchus, come propitious, all implore, 
and act thy [[sacred]] orgies o'er and o'er. 

but mineus' daughters [[daughter]], while these rites were pay'd, 
at [[home]], impertinently busie, stay'd. 
their wicked tasks they ply with various art [[arts]], 
and thro' the loom the sliding shuttle dart; 
or at the [[fire]] to comb the wooll they stand, 
or twirl the spindle with a dext'rous hand. 
guilty themselves, they [[force]] the guiltless in; 
their maids, who share the [[labour]], share the [[sin]]. 
at [[last]] one sister cries, who nimbly knew 
to draw nice threads, and winde the finest clue, 
while others idly rove, and gods revere, 
their fancy'd gods! they [[know]] not who, or where; 
let us, whom pallas taught her [[better]] [[arts]], 
still working, cheer with mirthful chat our hearts [[heart]], 
and to [[deceive]] the [[time]], let me prevail 
with each by turns to tell some antique tale. 
she said: her sisters lik'd the [[humour]] well, 
and smiling, [[bad]] her the first story tell. 
but she a-while profoundly seem'd to muse, 
perplex'd amid variety to chuse: 
and knew not, whether she should first relate 
the [[poor]] dircetis, and her wond'rous [[fate]]. 
the palestines [[believe]] it to a [[man]], 
and show the lake, in which her scales began. 
or if she rather should the [[daughter]] sing, 
who in the hoary verge of [[life]] took wing; 
who soar'd from [[earth]], and dwelt in tow'rs on high, 
and now a dove she flits along the [[sky]]. 
or how lewd nais, when her [[lust]] was cloy'd, 
to fishes turn'd the youths [[youth]], she had enjoy'd, 
by pow'rful verse, and herbs; effect most strange! 
at [[last]] the changer shar'd herself the [[change]]. 
or how the tree, which once [[white]] berries bore, 
still crimson bears, since stain'd with crimson gore. 
the tree was new; she likes it, and begins 
to tell the tale, and as she tells, she spins. 

the story of pyramus and thisbe 

in [[babylon]], where first her queen, for [[state]] 
rais'd walls of brick magnificently [[great]], 
liv'd pyramus, and thisbe, lovely pair! 
he found no eastern [[youth]] his [[equal]] there, 
and she beyond the fairest [[nymph]] was [[fair]]. 
a closer neighbourhood was never known, 
tho' two the houses, yet the roof was one. 
acquaintance grew, th' acquaintance they improve 
to [[friendship]], [[friendship]] ripen'd into [[love]]: 
love had been crown'd, but impotently mad, 
what parents could not hinder, they forbad. 
for with fierce flames [[young]] pyramus still burn'd, 
and grateful thisbe flames as fierce return'd. 
aloud in words their thoughts [[thought]] they dare not break, 
but silent stand; and silent looks can speak. 
the [[fire]] of [[love]] the more it is supprest, 
the more it glows, and rages in the breast. 

when the division-wall was built, a chink 
was left, the cement unobserv'd to shrink. 
so slight the cranny, that it still had been 
for centuries unclos'd, because unseen. 
but oh! what thing so small, so secret lies [[lie]], 
which scapes, if form'd for [[love]], a lover's [[eyes]]? 
ev'n in this narrow chink they quickly found 
a friendly passage for a trackless sound. 
safely they told their sorrows [[sorrow]], and their joys, 
in whisper'd murmurs, and a dying noise, 
by turns to catch each other's breath they strove, 
and suck'd in all the balmy breeze of [[love]]. 
oft as on diff'rent sides they stood, they cry'd, 
malicious wall, thus lovers to divide! 
suppose, thou should'st a-while to us give place 
to lock, and fasten in a close embrace: 
but if too much to grant so sweet a bliss, 
indulge at least the [[pleasure]] of a kiss. 
we scorn ingratitude: to thee, we [[know]], 
this safe conveyance of our minds [[mind]] we owe. 

thus they their [[vain]] petition did renew 
'till night, and then they softly sigh'd adieu. 
but first they strove to kiss, and that was all; 
their kisses dy'd untasted on the wall. 
soon as the morn had o'er the stars prevail'd, 
and warm'd by phoebus, flow'rs their dews exhal'd, 
the lovers to their well-known place return, 
alike they suffer, and alike they mourn. 
at [[last]] their parents they resolve to [[cheat]] 
(if to [[deceive]] in [[love]] be call'd deceit), 
to steal by night from [[home]], and thence unknown 
to seek the fields, and quit th' unfaithful town. 
but, to prevent their wand'ring in the dark, 
they both agree to fix upon a mark; 
a mark, that could not their designs expose: 
the tomb of ninus was the mark they chose. 
there they might rest secure beneath the shade, 
which boughs, with snowy fruit encumber'd, made: 
a wide-spread mulberry its rise had took 
just on the margin of a gurgling brook. 
impatient for the friendly dusk they stay; 
and chide the slowness of departing day; 
in western seas down sunk at [[last]] the [[light]], 
from western seas up-rose the shades of night. 
the loving thisbe ev'n prevents the hour, 
with cautious [[silence]] she unlocks the door, 
and veils her face, and marching thro' the gloom 
swiftly arrives at th' assignation-tomb. 
for still the fearful [[sex]] can fearless prove; 
boldly they act, if spirited by [[love]]. 
when lo! a lioness rush'd o'er the plain, 
grimly besmear'd with [[blood]] of oxen slain: 
and what to the dire sight new horrors brought, 
to slake her thirst the neighb'ring spring she sought. 
which, by the moon, when trembling thisbe spies, 
wing'd with her [[fear]], swift, as the wind, she flies; 
and in a cave recovers from her fright, 
but drop'd her veil, confounded in her flight. 
when sated with repeated draughts, again 
the queen of beasts scour'd back along the plain, 
she found the veil, and mouthing it all o'er, 
with bloody jaws the lifeless prey she tore. 

the [[youth]], who could not [[cheat]] his guards so soon, 
late came, and noted by the glimm'ring moon 
some savage feet, new printed on the ground, 
his cheeks turn'd pale, his limbs no vigour found; 
but when, advancing on, the veil he spied 
distain'd with [[blood]], and ghastly torn, he cried, 
one night shall [[death]] to two [[young]] lovers give, 
but she deserv'd unnumber'd years to live! 
'tis i am guilty, i have thee betray'd, 
who came not early, as my charming maid. 
whatever slew thee, i the cause remain, 
i nam'd, and fix'd the place where thou wast slain. 
ye lions from your neighb'ring dens repair, 
pity the wretch, this impious [[body]] tear! 
but cowards thus for [[death]] can idly cry; 
the brave still have it in their pow'r to [[die]]. 
then to th' appointed tree he hastes away, 
the veil first gather'd, tho' all rent it lay: 
the veil all rent yet still it [[self]] endears, 
he kist, and kissing, wash'd it with his tears. 
tho' [[rich]] (he cry'd) with many a precious stain, 
still from my [[blood]] a deeper tincture gain. 
then in his breast his shining [[sword]] he drown'd, 
and fell supine, extended on the ground. 
as out again the blade [[lie]] dying drew, 
out spun the [[blood]], and streaming upwards flew. 
so if a conduit-pipe e'er burst you saw, 
swift spring the gushing waters thro' the flaw: 
then spouting in a bow, they rise on high, 
and a new fountain plays amid the [[sky]]. 
the berries, stain'd with [[blood]], began to show 
a dark [[complexion]], and forgot their snow; 
while fatten'd with the flowing gore, the root 
was doom'd for ever to a purple fruit. 

mean-time [[poor]] thisbe fear'd, so long she stay'd, 
her lover might suspect a perjur'd maid. 
her fright scarce o'er, she strove the [[youth]] to find 
with ardent [[eyes]], which spoke an ardent [[mind]]. 
already in his arms, she hears him sigh 
at her destruction, which was once so nigh. 
the tomb, the tree, but not the fruit she knew, 
the fruit she doubted for its alter'd hue. 
still as she doubts [[doubt]], her [[eyes]] a [[body]] found 
quiv'ring in [[death]], and gasping on the ground. 
she started back, the red her cheeks forsook, 
and ev'ry nerve with thrilling horrors shook. 
so trembles the smooth surface of the seas, 
if brush'd o'er gently with a rising breeze. 
but when her view her bleeding [[love]] confest, 
she shriek'd, she tore her hair, she beat her breast. 
she rais'd the [[body]], and embrac'd it round, 
and bath'd with tears unfeign'd the gaping wound. 
then her warm lips to the cold face apply'd, 
and is it thus, ah! thus we meet, she cry'd! 
my pyramus! whence sprung thy cruel [[fate]]? 
my pyramus!- ah! speak, ere 'tis too late. 
i, thy own thisbe, but one word implore, 
one word thy thisbe never ask'd before. 
at thisbe's name, awak'd, he open'd wide 
his dying [[eyes]]; with dying [[eyes]] he try'd 
on her to dwell, but clos'd them slow, and dy'd. 

the fatal cause was now at [[last]] explor'd, 
her veil she knew, and saw his sheathless [[sword]]: 
from thy own hand thy ruin thou hast found, 
she said, but [[love]] first taught that hand to wound, 
ev'n i for thee as bold a hand can show, 
and [[love]], which shall as true direct the blow. 
i will against the woman's weakness strive, 
and never thee, lamented [[youth]], survive. 
the [[world]] may say, i caus'd, alas! thy [[death]], 
but saw thee breathless, and resign'd my breath. 
fate, tho' it conquers, shall no triumph gain, 
fate, that divides us, still divides in [[vain]]. 

now, both our cruel parents, hear my pray'r; 
my pray'r to offer for us both i dare; 
oh! see our ashes in one urn confin'd, 
whom [[love]] at first, and [[fate]] at [[last]] has join'd. 
the bliss, you envy'd, is not our request; 
lovers, when [[dead]], may sure together rest. 
thou, tree, where now one lifeless lump is laid, 
ere-long o'er two shalt cast a friendly shade. 
still let our loves [[love]] from thee be understood, 
still witness in thy purple fruit our [[blood]]. 
she spoke, and in her bosom plung'd the [[sword]], 
all warm and reeking from its slaughter'd [[lord]]. 
the pray'r, which dying thisbe had preferr'd, 
both gods, and parents, with compassion heard. 
the whiteness of the mulberry soon fled, 
and rip'ning, sadden'd in a dusky red: 
while both their parents their lost [[children]] mourn, 
and mix their ashes in one golden urn. 

thus did the melancholy tale conclude, 
and a short, silent interval ensu'd. 
the next in birth unloos'd her artful tongue, 
and drew attentive all the sister-throng. 

the story of leucothoe and the sun 

the sun, the source of [[light]], by beauty's pow'r 
once am'rous grew; then hear the sun's amour. 
venus, and [[mars]], with his far-piercing [[eyes]] 
this [[god]] first spy'd; this [[god]] first all things spies. 
stung at the sight, and swift on mischief bent, 
to haughty juno's shapeless [[son]] he went: 
the [[goddess]], and her [[god]] gallant betray'd, 
and told the cuckold, where their pranks were play'd. 
poor vulcan soon desir'd to hear no more, 
he drop'd his hammer, and he shook all o'er: 
then [[courage]] takes, and full of vengeful ire 
he heaves the bellows, and blows fierce the [[fire]]: 
from liquid brass, tho' sure, yet subtile snares 
he forms, and next a wond'rous net prepares, 
drawn with such [[curious]] art [[arts]], so nicely sly, 
unseen the mashes [[cheat]] the searching eye. 
not half so thin their webs the spiders weave, 
which the most wary, buzzing prey [[deceive]]. 
these chains, [[obedient]] to the touch, he spread 
in secret foldings o'er the conscious bed: 
the conscious bed again was quickly prest 
by the fond pair, in lawless raptures blest. 
mars wonder'd at his cytherea's charms, 
more fast than ever lock'd within her arms. 
while vulcan th' iv'ry doors unbarr'd with [[care]], 
then call'd the gods to view the sportive pair: 
the gods throng'd in, and saw in open day, 
where [[mars]], and beauty's queen, all naked, lay. 
o! shameful sight, if shameful that we name, 
which gods with envy view'd, and could not blame; 
but, for the [[pleasure]], wish'd to bear the shame. 
each deity, with laughter tir'd, departs, 
yet all still laugh'd at vulcan in their hearts [[heart]]. 

thro' heav'n the news of this surprizal run, 
but [[venus]] did not thus forget the sun. 
he, who stol'n transports idly had betray'd, 
by a betrayer was in [[kind]] repay'd. 
what now avails, [[great]] [[god]], thy piercing blaze, 
that [[youth]], and [[beauty]], and those golden rays? 
thou, who can'st warm this [[universe]] alone, 
feel'st now a warmth more pow'rful than thy own: 
and those bright [[eyes]], which all things should survey, 
know not from [[fair]] leucothoe to stray. 
the lamp of [[light]], for [[human]] [[good]] design'd, 
is to one virgin niggardly confin'd. 
sometimes too early rise thy eastern beams, 
sometimes too late they set in western streams: 
'tis then her [[beauty]] thy swift course delays, 
and gives to winter skies [[sky]] long summer days. 
now in thy face thy love-sick [[mind]] appears, 
and spreads thro' impious nations empty fears [[fear]]: 
for when thy beamless head is wrapt in night, 
poor mortals tremble in despair of [[light]]. 
'tis not the moon, that o'er thee casts a veil 
'tis [[love]] alone, which makes thy looks so pale. 
leucothoe is grown thy only [[care]], 
not phaeton's [[fair]] [[mother]] now is [[fair]]. 
the youthful rhodos moves no tender [[thought]], 
and beauteous porsa is at [[last]] forgot. 
fond clytie, scorn'd, yet lov'd, and sought thy bed, 
ev'n then thy [[heart]] for other virgins bled. 
leucothoe has all thy [[soul]] possest, 
and chas'd each rival passion from thy breast. 
to this bright [[nymph]] eurynome gave birth 
in the blest confines of the spicy [[earth]]. 
excelling others, she herself beheld 
by her own blooming [[daughter]] far excell'd. 
the sire was orchamus, whose vast command, 
the sev'nth from belus, rul'd the persian [[land]]. 

deep in cool vales, beneath th' hesperian [[sky]], 
for the sun's fiery steeds the pastures lye. 
ambrosia there they [[eat]], and thence they gain 
new vigour, and their daily toils sustain. 
while thus on heav'nly food the coursers fed, 
and night, around, her gloomy [[empire]] spread, 
the [[god]] assum'd the mother's shape and air, 
and pass'd, unheeded, to his darling [[fair]]. 
close by a lamp, with maids encompass'd round, 
the [[royal]] spinster, full employ'd, he found: 
then cry'd, a-while from [[work]], my [[daughter]], rest; 
and, like a [[mother]], scarce her lips he prest. 
servants retire!- nor secrets dare to hear, 
intrusted only to a daughter's ear. 
they swift obey'd: not one, suspicious, [[thought]] 
the secret, which their mistress would be taught. 
then he: since now no witnesses are near, 
behold! the [[god]], who guides the various year! 
the world's vast eye, of [[light]] the source serene, 
who all things sees, by whom are all things seen. 
believe me, nymph! (for i the [[truth]] have show'd) 
thy charms have pow'r to charm so [[great]] a [[god]]. 
confus'd, she heard him his soft passion tell, 
and on the floor, untwirl'd, the spindle fell: 
still from the sweet confusion some new grace 
blush'd out by stealth, and languish'd in her face. 
the lover, now inflam'd, himself put on, 
and out at once the [[god]], all-radiant, shone. 
the virgin startled at his alter'd form, 
too [[weak]] to bear a god's impetuous storm: 
no more against the dazling [[youth]] she strove, 
but silent yielded, and indulg'd his [[love]]. 

this clytie knew, and knew she was undone, 
whose [[soul]] was fix'd, and doated on the sun. 
she rag'd to [[think]] on her neglected charms, 
and phoebus, panting in another's arms. 
with envious madness fir'd, she flies in haste, 
and tells the [[king]], his [[daughter]] was unchaste. 
the [[king]], incens'd to hear his [[honour]] stain'd, 
no more the [[father]] nor the [[man]] retain'd. 
in [[vain]] she stretch'd her arms, and turn'd her [[eyes]] 
to her lov'd [[god]], th' enlightner of the skies [[sky]]. 
in [[vain]] she own'd it was a crime, yet still 
it was a crime not acted by her will. 
the brutal sire stood deaf to ev'ry pray'r, 
and deep in [[earth]] entomb'd alive the [[fair]]. 
what phoebus could do, was by phoebus done: 
full on her grave with pointed beams he shone: 
to pointed beams the gaping [[earth]] gave way; 
had the [[nymph]] [[eyes]], her [[eyes]] had seen the day, 
but lifeless now, yet lovely still, she lay. 
not more the [[god]] wept, when the [[world]] was fir'd, 
and in the wreck his blooming boy expir'd. 
the vital flame he strives to [[light]] again, 
and warm the frozen [[blood]] in ev'ry vein: 
but since resistless fates [[fate]] deny'd that pow'r, 
on the cold [[nymph]] he rain'd a nectar show'r. 
ah! undeserving thus (he said) to [[die]], 
yet still in odours thou shalt reach the [[sky]]. 
the [[body]] soon dissolv'd, and all around 
perfum'd with heav'nly fragrancies the ground, 
a [[sacrifice]] for gods up-rose from thence, 
a sweet, delightful tree of frankincense. 

the transformation of clytie 

tho' guilty clytie thus the sun betray'd, 
by too much passion she was guilty made. 
excess of [[love]] begot excess of [[grief]], 
grief fondly [[bad]] her hence to [[hope]] relief. 
but angry phoebus hears, unmov'd, her sighs, 
and scornful from her loath'd embraces flies. 
all day, all night, in trackless wilds, alone 
she pin'd, and taught the list'ning rocks her moan. 
on the bare [[earth]] she lies [[lie]], her bosom bare, 
loose her attire, dishevel'd is her hair. 
nine times [[time]] the morn unbarr'd the gates of [[light]], 
as oft were spread th' alternate shades of night, 
so long no sustenance the mourner knew, 
unless she drunk her tears, or suck'd the dew. 
she turn'd about, but rose not from the ground, 
turn'd to the sun, still as he roul'd his round: 
on his bright face hung her desiring [[eyes]], 
'till fix'd to [[earth]], she strove in [[vain]] to rise. 
her looks their paleness in a flow'r retain'd, 
but here, and there, some purple streaks they gain'd. 
still the lov'd object the fond leafs pursue, 
still move their root, the moving sun to view, 
and in the heliotrope the [[nymph]] is true. 

the sisters heard these wonders with surprise, 
but part receiv'd them as romantick lies [[lie]]; 
and pertly rally'd, that they could not see 
in pow'rs [[divine]] so vast an energy. 
part own'd, true gods such [[miracles]] might do, 
but own'd not bacchus, one among the true. 
at [[last]] a [[common]], just request they make, 
and beg alcithoe her turn to take. 
i will (she said) and please you, if i can. 
then shot her shuttle swift, and thus began. 

the [[fate]] of daphnis is a [[fate]] too known, 
whom an enamour'd [[nymph]] transform'd to stone, 
because she fear'd another [[nymph]] might see 
the lovely [[youth]], and [[love]] as much as she: 
so [[strange]] the madness is of jealousie! 
nor shall i tell, what changes [[change]] scython made, 
and how he walk'd a [[man]], or tripp'd a maid. 
you too would peevish frown, and patience want 
to hear, how celmis grew an adamant. 
he once was dear to jove, and saw of old 
jove, when a child; but what he saw, he told. 
crocus, and smilax may be turn'd to flow'rs, 
and the curetes spring from bounteous show'rs; 
i pass a hundred legends stale, as these, 
and with sweet novelty your taste will please. 

the story of salmacis and hermaphroditus 

how salmacis, with [[weak]] enfeebling streams 
softens the [[body]], and unnerves the limbs, 
and what the secret cause, shall here be shown; 
the cause is secret, but th' effect is known. 

the naids nurst an infant heretofore, 
that cytherea once to hermes bore: 
from both th' illustrious authors of his [[race]] 
the child was nam'd, nor was it hard to trace 
both the bright parents thro' the infant's face. 
when fifteen years in ida's cool retreat 
the boy had told, he left his native seat, 
and sought fresh fountains in a [[foreign]] soil: 
the [[pleasure]] lessen'd the attending toil, 
with eager steps the lycian fields he crost, 
a river here he view'd so lovely bright, 
it shew'd the bottom in a fairer [[light]], 
nor kept a sand conceal'd from [[human]] sight. 
the stream produc'd nor slimy ooze, nor weeds, 
nor miry rushes, nor the spiky reeds; 
but dealt enriching moisture all around, 
the fruitful banks with chearful verdure crown'd, 
and kept the spring eternal on the ground. 
a [[nymph]] presides, not practis'd in the chace, 
nor skilful at the bow, nor at the [[race]]; 
of all the blue-ey'd daughters [[daughter]] of the main, 
the only stranger to diana's train: 
her sisters often, as 'tis said, wou'd cry, 
"fie salmacis: what, always idle! fie. 
or take thy quiver, or thy arrows seize, 
and mix the toils of hunting with thy ease." 
nor quiver she nor arrows e'er wou'd seize, 
nor mix the toils of hunting with her ease. 
but oft would bathe her in the chrystal tide, 
oft with a comb her dewy locks divide; 
now in the limpid streams she views her face, 
and drest her image in the floating glass: 
on beds of leaves she now repos'd her limbs, 
now gather'd flow'rs that grew about her streams, 
and then by [[chance]] was gathering, as he stood 
to view the boy, and long'd for what she view'd. 

fain wou'd she meet the [[youth]] with hasty feet, 
she fain wou'd meet him, but refus'd to meet 
before her looks were set with nicest [[care]], 
and well deserv'd to be reputed [[fair]]. 
"bright [[youth]]," she cries, "whom all thy features prove 
a [[god]], and, if a [[god]], the [[god]] of [[love]]; 
but if a mortal, blest thy nurse's breast, 
blest are thy parents, and thy sisters blest: 
but oh how blest! how more than blest thy bride, 
ally'd in bliss, if any yet ally'd. 
if so, let mine the stoln enjoyments be; 
if not, behold a willing bride in me." 

the boy knew nought of [[love]], and toucht with shame, 
he strove, and blusht, but still the blush became: 
in rising blushes still fresh beauties [[beauty]] rose; 
the sunny side of fruit such blushes shows, 
and such the moon, when all her silver [[white]] 
turns in eclipses to a ruddy [[light]]. 
the [[nymph]] still begs, if not a nobler bliss, 
a cold salute at least, a sister's kiss: 
and now prepares to take the lovely boy 
between her arms. he, innocently coy, 
replies, "or leave me to my [[self]] alone, 
you rude uncivil [[nymph]], or i'll be gone." 
"fair stranger then," says she, "it shall be so"; 
and, for she fear'd his threats, she feign'd to go: 
but hid within a covert's neighbouring green, 
she kept him still in sight, herself unseen. 
the boy now fancies all the danger o'er, 
and innocently sports [[sport]] about the shore, 
playful and wanton to the stream he trips, 
and dips his foot, and shivers as he dips. 
the coolness pleas'd him, and with eager haste 
his airy garments on the banks he cast; 
his godlike features, and his heav'nly hue, 
and all his beauties [[beauty]] were expos'd to view. 
his naked limbs the [[nymph]] with rapture spies, 
while hotter [[passions]] in her bosom rise, 
flush in her cheeks, and sparkle in her [[eyes]]. 
she longs, she burns to clasp him in her arms, 
and looks, and sighs, and kindles at his charms. 

now all undrest upon the banks he stood, 
and clapt his sides, and leapt into the flood: 
his lovely limbs the silver waves divide, 
his limbs appear more lovely through the tide; 
as lillies shut within a chrystal case, 
receive a glossy lustre from the glass. 
he's mine, he's all my own, the naid cries, 
and flings off all, and after him she flies. 
and now she fastens on him as he swims, 
and holds him close, and wraps about his limbs. 
the more the boy resisted, and was coy, 
the more she clipt, and kist the strugling boy. 
so when the wrigling snake is snatcht on high 
in eagle's claws, and hisses in the [[sky]], 
around the foe his twirling tail he flings, 
and twists her legs, and wriths about her wings. 

the restless boy still obstinately strove 
to [[free]] himself, and still refus'd her [[love]]. 
amidst his limbs she kept her limbs intwin'd, 
"and why, coy [[youth]]," she cries, "why thus unkind! 
oh may the gods thus keep us ever join'd! 
oh may we never, never part again!" 

so pray'd the [[nymph]], nor did she [[pray]] in [[vain]]: 
for now she finds him, as his limbs she prest, 
grow nearer still, and nearer to her breast; 
'till, piercing each the other's flesh, they run 
together, and incorporate in one: 
last in one face are both their faces join'd, 
as when the stock and grafted twig combin'd 
shoot up the same, and wear a [[common]] rind: 
both bodies [[body]] in a [[single]] [[body]] mix, 
a [[single]] [[body]] with a double [[sex]]. 

the boy, thus lost in woman, now survey'd 
the river's guilty stream, and thus he pray'd. 
(he pray'd, but wonder'd at his softer tone, 
surpriz'd to hear a voice but half his own.) 
you parent-gods, whose heav'nly names i bear, 
hear your hermaphrodite, and grant my pray'r; 
oh grant, that whomsoe'er these streams contain, 
if [[man]] he enter'd, he may rise again 
supple, unsinew'd, and but half a man! 

the heav'nly parents answer'd from on high, 
their two-shap'd [[son]], the double votary 
then gave a secret [[virtue]] to the flood, 
and ting'd its source to make his wishes [[wish]] [[good]]. 

alcithoe and her sisters transform'd to bats 

but mineus' daughters [[daughter]] still their tasks pursue, 
to wickedness most obstinately true: 
at bacchus still they laugh, when all around, 
unseen, the timbrels hoarse were heard to sound. 
saffron and myrrh their fragrant odours shed, 
and now the [[present]] deity they dread. 
strange to relate! here ivy first was seen, 
along the distaff crept the wond'rous green. 
then sudden-springing vines began to bloom, 
and the soft tendrils curl'd around the loom: 
while purple clusters, dangling from on high, 
ting'd the wrought purple with a second [[die]]. 

now from the skies [[sky]] was shot a doubtful [[light]], 
the day declining to the bounds of night. 
the fabrick's firm foundations shake all o'er, 
false tigers rage, and figur'd lions roar. 
torches, aloft, seem blazing in the air, 
and angry flashes of red light'nings glare. 
to dark recesses, the dire sight to shun, 
swift the pale sisters in confusion run. 
their arms were lost in pinions, as they fled, 
and subtle films each slender limb o'er-spread. 
their alter'd forms their senses soon reveal'd; 
their forms, how alter'd, darkness still conceal'd. 
close to the roof each, wond'ring, upwards springs, 
born on unknown, transparent, plumeless wings. 
they strove for words; their little bodies [[body]] found 
no words, but murmur'd in a fainting sound. 
in towns, not woods, the sooty bats delight, 
and, never, 'till the dusk, begin their flight; 
'till vesper rises with his ev'ning flame; 
from whom the romans have deriv'd their name. 

the transformation of ino and melicerta to sea-gods 

the pow'r of bacchus now o'er thebes had flown: 
with awful rev'rence soon the [[god]] they own. 
proud ino, all around the wonder tells, 
and on her nephew deity still dwells. 
of num'rous sisters, she alone yet knew 
no [[grief]], but [[grief]], which she from sisters drew. 

imperial juno saw her with disdain, 
vain in her offspring, in her consort [[vain]], 
who rul'd the trembling thebans with a nod, 
but saw her vainest in her foster-god. 
could then (she cry'd) a bastard-boy have pow'r 
to make a [[mother]] her own [[son]] devour? 
could he the tuscan crew to fishes [[change]], 
and now three sisters damn to forms so [[strange]]? 
yet shall the [[wife]] of jove find no relief? 
shall she, still unreveng'd, disclose her [[grief]]? 
have i the mighty [[freedom]] to [[complain]]? 
is that my pow'r? is that to ease my [[pain]]? 
a foe has taught me vengeance; and who ought 
to scorn that vengeance, which a foe has taught? 
what sure destruction frantick rage can throw, 
the gaping wounds of slaughter'd pentheus show. 
why should not ino, fir'd with madness, stray, 
like her mad sisters her own kindred slay? 
why, she not [[follow]], where they lead the way? 

down a steep, yawning cave, where yews display'd 
in arches meet, and lend a baleful shade, 
thro' silent labyrinths a passage lies [[lie]] 
to mournful regions, and infernal skies [[sky]]. 
here styx exhales its noisome clouds, and here, 
the fun'ral rites once paid, all souls [[soul]] appear. 
stiff cold, and [[horror]] with a ghastly face 
and staring [[eyes]], infest the dreary place. 
ghosts, new-arriv'd, and strangers to these plains, 
know not the palace, where grim pluto reigns. 
they [[journey]] doubtful, nor the road can tell, 
which leads to the metropolis of hell. 
a thousand avenues those tow'rs command, 
a thousand gates for ever open stand. 
as all the rivers, disembogu'd, find room 
for all their waters in old ocean's womb: 
so this vast [[city]] worlds [[world]] of shades receives, 
and space for millions still of worlds [[world]] she leaves. 
th' unbody'd spectres freely rove, and show 
whate'er they lov'd on [[earth]], they [[love]] below. 
the lawyers still, or [[right]], or [[wrong]], support, 
the courtiers smoothly glide to pluto's court. 
still airy heroes thoughts [[thought]] of [[glory]] [[fire]], 
still the [[dead]] poet strings his deathless lyre, 
and lovers still with fancy'd darts expire. 

the queen of [[heaven]], to gratify her hate, 
and sooth [[immortal]] wrath, forgets her [[state]]. 
down from the realms of day, to realms of night, 
the [[goddess]] swift precipitates her flight. 
at hell arriv'd, the noise hell's porter heard, 
th' enormous dog his triple head up-rear'd: 
thrice from three grizly throats he howl'd profound, 
then suppliant couch'd, and stretch'd along the ground. 
the trembling threshold, which saturnia prest, 
the weight of such divinity confest. 

before a lofty, adamantine gate, 
which clos'd a tow'r of brass, the furies sate: 
mis-shapen forms, tremendous to the sight, 
th' implacable foul daughters [[daughter]] of the night. 
a sounding whip each bloody sister shakes, 
or from her tresses combs the curling snakes. 
but now [[great]] juno's majesty was known; 
thro' the thick gloom, all heav'nly bright, she shone: 
the hideous monsters their [[obedience]] show'd, 
and rising from their seats, submissive bow'd. 

this is the place of woe, here groan the [[dead]]; 
huge tityus o'er nine acres here is spread. 
fruitful for [[pain]] th' [[immortal]] liver breeds, 
still grows, and still th' insatiate vulture feeds. 
poor tantalus to taste the water tries, 
but from his lips the faithless water flies: 
then thinks [[think]] the bending tree he can command, 
the tree starts backwards, and eludes his hand. 
the [[labour]] too of sisyphus is [[vain]], 
up the steep mount he heaves the stone with [[pain]], 
down from the summet rouls the stone again. 
the belides their leaky vessels still 
are ever filling, and yet never fill: 
doom'd to this [[punishment]] for [[blood]] they shed, 
for bridegrooms slaughter'd in the bridal bed. 
stretch'd on the rolling wheel ixion lies [[lie]]; 
himself he follows, and himself he flies. 
ixion, tortur'd, juno sternly ey'd, 
then turn'd, and toiling sisyphus espy'd: 
and why (she said) so wretched is the [[fate]] 
of him, whose [[brother]] proudly reigns in [[state]]? 
yet still my altars unador'd have been 
by athamas, and his presumptuous queen. 

what caus'd her hate, the [[goddess]] thus confest, 
what caus'd her [[journey]] now was more than guest. 
that hate, relentless, its [[revenge]] did want, 
and that [[revenge]] the furies soon could grant: 
they could the [[glory]] of proud thebes efface, 
and hide in ruin the cadmean [[race]]. 
for this she largely promises, entreats, 
and to intreaties adds imperial threats. 

then fell tisiphone with rage was stung, 
and from her mouth th' untwisted serpents flung. 
to gain this trifling boon, there is no need 
(she cry'd) in formal speeches [[speech]] to proceed. 
whatever thou command'st to do, is done; 
believe it finish'd, tho' not yet begun. 
but from these melancholly seats repair 
to happier mansions, and to purer air. 
she spoke: the [[goddess]], darting upwards, flies, 
and joyous re-ascends her native skies [[sky]]: 
nor enter'd there, till 'round her iris threw 
ambrosial sweets, and pour'd celestial dew. 

the faithful fury, guiltless of delays, 
with cruel haste the dire command obeys. 
girt in a bloody gown, a torch she shakes, 
and round her neck twines speckled wreaths of snakes. 
fear, and dismay, and agonizing [[pain]], 
with frantick rage, compleat her loveless train. 
to thebes her flight she sped, and hell forsook; 
at her approach the theban turrets shook: 
the sun shrunk back, thick clouds the day o'er-cast, 
and springing greens were wither'd as she [[past]]. 

now, dismal yellings heard, [[strange]] spectres seen, 
confound as much the monarch as the queen. 
in [[vain]] to quit the palace they prepar'd, 
tisiphone was there, and kept the ward. 
she wide extended her unfriendly arms, 
and all the fury lavish'd all her harms. 
part of her tresses loudly hiss, and part 
spread poyson, as their forky tongues they dart. 
then from her middle locks two snakes she drew, 
whose [[merit]] from superior mischief grew: 
th' envenom'd ruin, thrown with spiteful [[care]], 
clung to the bosoms of the hapless pair. 
the hapless pair soon with wild thoughts [[thought]] were fir'd, 
and madness, by a thousand ways inspir'd. 
'tis true, th' unwounded [[body]] still was sound, 
but 'twas the [[soul]] which [[felt]] the deadly wound. 
nor did th' unsated monster here give o'er, 
but dealt of plagues a fresh, unnumber'd store. 
each baneful juice too well she understood, 
foam, churn'd by cerberus, and hydra's [[blood]]. 
hot hemlock, and cold aconite she chose, 
delighted in variety of woes. 
whatever can untune th' harmonious [[soul]], 
and its mild, reas'ning faculties controul, 
give false ideas [[idea]], raise desires [[desire]] profane, 
and whirl in eddies the tumultuous brain, 
mix'd with curs'd art [[arts]], she direfully around 
thro' all their nerves diffus'd the [[sad]] compound. 
then toss'd her torch in circles still the same, 
improv'd their rage, and added flame to flame. 
the grinning fury her own [[conquest]] spy'd, 
and to her rueful shades return'd with [[pride]], 
and threw th' exhausted, useless snakes aside. 

now athamas cries out, his [[reason]] fled, 
here, fellow-hunters, let the toils be spread. 
i saw a lioness, in quest of food, 
with her two [[young]], run roaring in this wood. 
again the fancy'd savages were seen, 
as thro' his palace still he chac'd his queen; 
then tore learchus from her breast: the child 
stretch'd little arms, and on its [[father]] smil'd: 
a [[father]] now no more, who now begun 
around his head to whirl his giddy [[son]], 
and, quite insensible to nature's call, 
the helpless infant flung against the wall. 
the same mad poyson in the [[mother]] wrought, 
young melicerta in her arms she caught, 
and with disorder'd tresses, howling, flies, 
o! bacchus, evoe, bacchus! loud she cries. 
the name of bacchus juno laugh'd to hear, 
and said, thy foster-god has cost thee dear. 

a rock there stood, whose side the beating waves 
had long consum'd, and hollow'd into caves. 
the head shot forwards in a bending steep, 
and cast a dreadful covert o'er the deep. 
the wretched ino, on destruction bent, 
climb'd up the cliff; such [[strength]] her fury lent: 
thence with her guiltless boy, who wept in [[vain]], 
at one bold spring she plung'd into the main. 

her neice's [[fate]] touch'd cytherea's breast, 
and in soft sounds she [[neptune]] thus addrest: 
great [[god]] of waters, whose extended sway 
is next to his, whom heav'n and [[earth]] obey: 
let not the suit of [[venus]] thee displease, 
pity the floaters on th' ionian seas. 
encrease thy subject-gods, nor yet disdain 
to add my kindred to that glorious train. 
if from the sea i may such honours [[honour]] claim, 
if 'tis desert, that from the sea i came, 
as grecian poets artfully have sung, 
and in the name confest, from whence i sprung. 

pleas'd [[neptune]] nodded his assent, and [[free]] 
both soon became from frail [[mortality]]. 
he gave them form, and majesty [[divine]], 
and [[bad]] them glide along the foamy brine. 
for melicerta is palaemon known, 
and ino once, leucothoe is grown. 

the transformation of the theban matrons 

the theban matrons their lov'd queen pursu'd, 
and tracing to the rock, her footsteps view'd. 
too [[certain]] of her [[fate]], they rend the skies [[sky]] 
with piteous shrieks, and lamentable cries. 
all beat their breasts, and juno all upbraid, 
who still remember'd a deluded maid: 
who, still revengeful for one stol'n embrace, 
thus wreak'd her hate on the cadmean [[race]]. 
this juno heard: and shall such elfs, she cry'd, 
dispute my [[justice]], or my pow'r deride? 
you too shall [[feel]] my wrath not idly spent; 
a [[goddess]] never for insults was meant. 

she, who lov'd most, and who most lov'd had been, 
said, not the waves shall part me from my queen. 
she strove to plunge into the roaring flood; 
fix'd to the stone, a stone her [[self]] she stood. 
this, on her breast would fain her blows repeat, 
her stiffen'd hands refus'd her breast to beat. 
that, stretch'd her arms unto the seas; in [[vain]] 
her arms she labour'd to unstretch again. 
to tear her comely locks another try'd, 
both comely locks, and fingers petryfi'd. 
part thus; but juno with a softer [[mind]] 
part doom'd to mix among the feather'd [[kind]]. 
transform'd, the name of theban birds they keep, 
and skim the surface of that fatal deep. 

cadmus and his queen transform'd to serpents 

mean-time, the wretched cadmus mourns, nor knows [[know]], 
that they who mortal fell, [[immortal]] rose. 
with a long series of new ills opprest, 
he droops, and all the [[man]] forsakes his breast. 
strange prodigies confound his frighted [[eyes]]; 
from the [[fair]] [[city]], which he rais'd, he flies: 
as if misfortune not pursu'd his [[race]], 
but only hung o'er that devoted place. 
resolv'd by sea to seek some distant [[land]], 
at [[last]] he safely gain'd th' illyrian strand. 
chearless himself, his consort still he chears, 
hoary, and loaden'd both with woes and years. 
then to recount [[past]] sorrows [[sorrow]] they begin, 
and trace them to the gloomy origin. 
that serpent sure was hallow'd, cadmus cry'd, 
which once my spear transfix'd with foolish [[pride]]; 
when the big teeth, a seed before unknown, 
by me along the wond'ring glebe were sown, 
and sprouting armies [[army]] by themselves o'erthrown. 
if thence the wrath of heav'n on me is bent, 
may heav'n conclude it with one [[sad]] event; 
to an extended serpent [[change]] the [[man]]: 
and while he spoke, the wish'd-for [[change]] began. 
his skin with sea-green spots was vary'd 'round, 
and on his belly prone he prest the ground. 
he glitter'd soon with many a golden scale, 
and his shrunk legs clos'd in a spiry tail. 
arms yet remain'd, remaining arms he spread 
to his lov'd [[wife]], and [[human]] tears yet shed. 
come, my harmonia, come, thy face recline 
down to my face; still touch, what still is mine. 
o! let these hands, while hands, be gently prest, 
while yet the serpent has not all possest. 
more he had spoke, but strove to speak in [[vain]], 
the forky tongue refus'd to tell his [[pain]], 
and learn'd in hissings only to [[complain]]. 

then shriek'd harmonia, stay, my cadmus, stay, 
glide not in such a monstrous shape away! 
destruction, like impetuous waves, rouls on. 
where are thy feet, thy legs, thy shoulders gone? 
chang'd is thy visage, chang'd is all thy frame; 
cadmus is only cadmus now in name. 
ye gods, my cadmus to himself restore, 
or me like him transform; i ask no more. 

the husband-serpent show'd he still had [[thought]], 
with wonted fondness an embrace he sought; 
play'd 'round her neck in many a harmless twist, 
and lick'd that bosom, which, a [[man]], he kist. 
the lookers-on (for lookers-on there were) 
shock'd at the sight, half-dy'd away with [[fear]]. 
the transformation was again renew'd, 
and, like the husband, chang'd the [[wife]] they view'd. 
both, serpents now, with fold involv'd in fold, 
to the next covert amicably roul'd. 
there curl'd they [[lie]], or wave along the green, 
fearless see [[men]], by [[men]] are fearless seen, 
still mild, and conscious what they once have been. 

the story of perseus 

yet tho' this harsh, inglorious [[fate]] they found, 
each in the deathless grandson liv'd renown'd. 
thro' conquer'd [[india]] bacchus nobly rode, 
and greece with temples hail'd the conqu'ring [[god]]. 
in argos only proud acrisius reign'd, 
who all the consecrated rites profan'd. 
audacious wretch! thus bacchus to deny, 
and the [[great]] thunderer's [[great]] [[son]] defie! 
nor him alone: thy [[daughter]] vainly strove, 
brave perseus of celestial stem to prove, 
and her [[self]] pregnant by a golden jove. 
yet this was true, and [[truth]] in [[time]] prevails; 
acrisius now his unbelief bewails. 
his former [[thought]], an impious [[thought]] he found, 
and both the heroe, and the [[god]] were own'd. 
he saw, already one in heav'n was plac'd, 
and one with more than mortal triumphs grac'd, 
the victor perseus with the gorgon-head, 
o'er libyan sands his airy [[journey]] sped. 
the gory drops distill'd, as swift he flew, 
and from each drop envenom'd serpents grew, 
the mischiefs brooded on the barren plains, 
and still th' unhappy fruitfulness remains. 

atlas transform'd to a mountain 

thence perseus, like a cloud, by storms was driv'n, 
thro' all th' expanse beneath the cope of [[heaven]]. 
the jarring winds unable to controul, 
he saw the southern, and the northern pole: 
and eastward thrice, and westward thrice was whirl'd, 
and from the skies [[sky]] survey'd the nether [[world]]. 
but when grey ev'ning show'd the verge of night, 
he fear'd in darkness to pursue his flight. 
he pois'd his pinions, and forgot to soar, 
and sinking, clos'd them on th' hesperian shore: 
then beg'd to rest, 'till lucifer begun 
to wake the morn, the morn to wake the sun. 

here atlas reign'd, of more than [[human]] size, 
and in his [[kingdom]] the world's limit lies [[lie]]. 
here titan bids his weary'd coursers sleep, 
and cools the burning axle in the deep. 
the mighty monarch, uncontrol'd, alone, 
his sceptre sways: no neighb'ring states are known. 
a thousand flocks on shady mountains fed, 
a thousand herds o'er grassy plains were spread. 
here wond'rous trees their shining stores unfold, 
their shining stores too wond'rous to be told, 
their leafs, their branches, and their apples, gold. 
then perseus the gigantick [[prince]] addrest, 
humbly implor'd a hospitable rest. 
if bold exploits thy admiration [[fire]], 
he said, i fancy, mine thou wilt [[admire]]. 
or if the [[glory]] of a [[race]] can move, 
not mean my [[glory]], for i spring from jove. 
at this [[confession]] atlas ghastly star'd, 
mindful of what an oracle declar'd, 
that the dark womb of [[time]] conceal'd a day, 
which should, disclos'd, the bloomy gold betray: 
all should at once be ravish'd from his [[eyes]], 
and jove's own progeny enjoy the prize. 
for this, the fruit he loftily immur'd, 
and a fierce dragon the strait pass secur'd. 
for this, all strangers he forbad to [[land]], 
and drove them from th' inhospitable strand. 
to perseus then: fly quickly, fly this coast, 
nor falsly dare thy acts and [[race]] to boast. 
in [[vain]] the heroe for one night entreats, 
threat'ning he storms, and next adds [[force]] to threats. 
by [[strength]] not perseus could himself defend, 
for who in [[strength]] with atlas could contend? 
but since short rest to me thou wilt not give, 
a gift of endless rest from me receive, 
he said, and backward turn'd, no more conceal'd 
the [[present]], and medusa's head reveal'd. 
soon the high atlas a high mountain stood, 
his locks, and beard became a leafy wood. 
his hands, and shoulders, into ridges went, 
the summit-head still crown'd the steep ascent. 
his bones a solid, rocky hardness gain'd: 
he, thus immensely grown (as [[fate]] ordain'd), 
the stars, the heav'ns, and all the gods sustain'd. 

andromeda rescu'd from the sea monster 

now aeolus had with [[strong]] chains confin'd, 
and deep imprison'd e'vry blust'ring wind, 
the rising phospher with a purple [[light]] 
did sluggish mortals to new toils invite. 
his feet again the valiant perseus plumes, 
and his keen sabre in his hand resumes: 
then nobly spurns the ground, and upwards springs, 
and cuts the liquid air with sounding wings. 
o'er various seas, and various lands [[land]] he [[past]], 
'till aethiopia's shore appear'd at [[last]]. 
andromeda was there, doom'd to attone 
by her own ruin follies not her own: 
and if [[injustice]] in a [[god]] can be, 
such was the libyan god's [[unjust]] decree. 
chain'd to a rock she stood; [[young]] perseus stay'd 
his rapid flight, to view the beauteous maid. 
so sweet her frame, so exquisitely fine, 
she seem'd a statue by a hand [[divine]], 
had not the wind her waving tresses show'd, 
and down her cheeks the melting sorrows [[sorrow]] flow'd. 
her faultless form the heroe's bosom fires [[fire]]; 
the more he looks, the more he still admires. 
th' admirer almost had forgot to fly, 
and swift descended, flutt'ring from on high. 
o! virgin, worthy no such chains to prove, 
but pleasing chains in the soft folds of [[love]]; 
thy [[country]], and thy name (he said) disclose, 
and give a true rehearsal of thy woes. 

a quick reply her bashfulness refus'd, 
to the [[free]] converse of a [[man]] unus'd. 
her rising blushes had concealment found 
from her spread hands, but that her hands were bound. 
she acted to her full extent of pow'r, 
and bath'd her face with a fresh, silent show'r. 
but by degrees [[degree]] in innocence grown bold, 
her name, her [[country]], and her birth she told: 
and how she suffer'd for her mother's [[pride]], 
who with the nereids once in [[beauty]] vy'd. 
part yet untold, the seas began to roar, 
and mounting billows tumbled to the shore. 
above the waves a monster rais'd his head, 
his [[body]] o'er the deep was widely spread: 
onward he flounc'd; aloud the virgin cries; 
each parent to her shrieks in shrieks replies: 
but she had deepest cause to rend the skies [[sky]]. 
weeping, to her they cling; no sign appears 
of [[help]], they only lend their helpless tears. 
too long you vent your sorrows [[sorrow]], perseus said, 
short is the hour, and swift the [[time]] of aid, 
in me the [[son]] of thund'ring jove behold, 
got in a kindly show'r of fruitful gold. 
medusa's snaky head is now my prey, 
and thro' the clouds i boldly wing my way. 
if such desert be worthy of esteem, 
and, if your [[daughter]] i from [[death]] redeem, 
shall she be mine? shall it not then be [[thought]], 
a bride, so lovely, was too cheaply bought? 
for her my arms i willingly employ, 
if i may beauties [[beauty]], which i save, enjoy. 
the parents eagerly the terms embrace: 
for who would slight such terms in such a case? 
nor her alone they promise, but beside, 
the dowry of a [[kingdom]] with the bride. 

as well-rigg'd gallies, which slaves [[slave]], sweating, row, 
with their sharp beaks the whiten'd ocean plough; 
so when the monster mov'd, still at his back 
the furrow'd waters left a foamy track. 
now to the rock he was advanc'd so nigh, 
whirl'd from a sling a stone the space would fly. 
then bounding, upwards the brave perseus sprung, 
and in mid air on hov'ring pinions hung. 
his shadow quickly floated on the main; 
the monster could not his wild rage restrain, 
but at the floating shadow leap'd in [[vain]]. 
as when jove's bird, a speckl'd serpent spies, 
which in the shine of phoebus basking lies [[lie]], 
unseen, he souses down, and bears away, 
truss'd from behind, the vainly-hissing prey. 
to writh his neck the [[labour]] nought avails, 
too deep th' imperial talons pierce his scales. 
thus the wing'd heroe now descends, now soars, 
and at his [[pleasure]] the vast monster gores. 
full in his back, swift stooping from above, 
the crooked sabre to its hilt he drove. 
the monster rag'd, impatient of the [[pain]], 
first bounded high, and then sunk low again. 
now, like a savage boar, when chaf'd with wounds, 
and bay'd with opening mouths of hungry hounds, 
he on the foe turns with collected might, 
who still eludes him with an airy flight; 
and wheeling round, the scaly armour tries 
of his thick sides; his thinner tall now plies: 
'till from repeated strokes out gush'd a flood, 
and the waves redden'd with the streaming [[blood]]. 
at [[last]] the dropping wings, befoam'd all o'er, 
with flaggy heaviness their master bore: 
a rock he spy'd, whose humble head was low, 
bare at an ebb, but cover'd at a flow. 
a ridgy hold, he, thither flying, gain'd, 
and with one hand his bending weight sustain'd; 
with th' other, vig'rous blows he dealt around, 
and the home-thrusts the expiring monster own'd. 
in deaf'ning shouts the glad applauses rise, 
and peal on peal runs ratling thro' the skies [[sky]]. 
the saviour-youth the [[royal]] pair confess, 
and with heav'd hands their daughter's bridegroom bless.

the beauteous bride moves on, now loos'd from chains, 
the cause, and sweet [[reward]] of all the heroe's pains [[pain]], 

mean-time, on shore triumphant perseus stood, 
and purg'd his hands, smear'd with the monster's [[blood]]: 
then in the windings of a sandy bed 
compos'd medusa's execrable head. 
but to prevent the roughness, leafs he threw, 
and [[young]], green twigs, which soft in waters grew, 
there soft, and full of sap; but here, when lay'd, 
touch'd by the head, that softness soon decay'd. 
the wonted flexibility quite gone, 
the tender scyons harden'd into stone. 
fresh, juicy twigs, surpriz'd, the nereids brought, 
fresh, juicy twigs the same contagion caught. 
the nymphs [[nymph]] the petrifying seeds still keep, 
and propagate the wonder thro' the deep. 
the pliant sprays of coral yet declare 
their stiff'ning [[nature]], when expos'd to air. 
those sprays, which did, like bending osiers, move, 
snatch'd from their element, obdurate prove, 
and shrubs beneath the waves, grow stones above. 

the [[great]] immortals [[immortal]] grateful perseus prais'd, 
and to three pow'rs three turfy altars rais'd. 
to hermes this; and that he did assign 
to pallas: the mid honours [[honour]], jove, were thine, 
he hastes for pallas a [[white]] cow to cull, 
a calf for hermes, but for jove a bull. 
then seiz'd the prize of his victorious [[fight]], 
andromeda, and claim'd the nuptial rite. 
andromeda alone he greatly sought, 
the dowry [[kingdom]] was not worth his [[thought]]. 

pleas'd hymen now his golden torch displays; 
with [[rich]] oblations fragrant altars blaze, 
sweet wreaths of choicest flow'rs are hung on high, 
and cloudless [[pleasure]] smiles in ev'ry eye. 
the melting musick melting thoughts [[thought]] inspires, 
and warbling songsters aid the warbling lyres. 
the palace opens wide in pompous [[state]], 
and by his peers surrounded, cepheus sate. 
a feast was serv'd, fit for a [[king]] to give, 
and fit for god-like heroes to receive. 
the banquet ended, the [[gay]], chearful bowl 
mov'd round, and brighten'd, and enlarg'd each [[soul]]. 
then perseus ask'd, what customs there obtain'd, 
and by what laws [[law]] the [[people]] were restrain'd. 
which told; the teller a like [[freedom]] takes, 
and to the warrior his petition makes, 
to [[know]], what [[arts]] had won medusa's snakes. 

the story of medusa's head 

the heroe with his just request complies, 
shows, how a vale beneath cold atlas lies [[lie]], 
where, with aspiring mountains fenc'd around, 
he the two daughters [[daughter]] of old phorcus found. 
fate had one [[common]] eye to both assign'd, 
each saw by turns, and each by turns was blind. 
but while one strove to lend her sister sight, 
he stretch'd his hand, and stole their mutual [[light]], 
and left both eyeless, both involv'd in night. 
thro' devious wilds, and trackless woods he [[past]], 
and at the gorgon-seats arriv'd at [[last]]: 
but as he journey'd, pensive he survey'd, 
what wasteful havock dire medusa made. 
here, stood still breathing statues, [[men]] before; 
there, rampant lions seem'd in stone to roar. 
nor did he, yet affrighted, quit the field, 
but in the mirror of his polish'd shield 
reflected saw medusa slumbers take, 
and not one serpent by [[good]] [[chance]] awake. 
then backward an unerring blow he sped, 
and from her [[body]] lop'd at once her head. 
the gore prolifick prov'd; with sudden [[force]] 
sprung pegasus, and wing'd his airy course. 

the heav'n-born warrior faithfully went on, 
and told the num'rous dangers which he run. 
what [[subject]] seas, what lands [[land]] he had in view, 
and nigh what stars th' advent'rous heroe flew. 
at [[last]] he silent sate; the list'ning throng 
sigh'd at the pause of his delightful tongue. 
some beg'd to [[know]], why this alone should wear, 
of all the sisters, such destructive hair. 

great perseus then: with me you shall prevail, 
worth the relation, to relate a tale. 
medusa once had charms; to gain her [[love]] 
a rival crowd of envious lovers strove. 
they, who have seen her, own, they ne'er did trace 
more moving features in a sweeter face. 
yet above all, her length of hair, they own, 
in golden ringlets wav'd, and graceful shone. 
her [[neptune]] saw, and with such beauties [[beauty]] fir'd, 
resolv'd to compass, what his [[soul]] desir'd. 
in chaste minerva's fane, he, lustful, stay'd, 
and seiz'd, and rifled the [[young]], blushing maid. 
the bashful [[goddess]] turn'd her [[eyes]] away, 
nor durst such bold impurity survey; 
but on the ravish'd virgin vengeance takes, 
her shining hair is chang'd to hissing snakes. 
these in her aegis pallas joys to bear, 
the hissing snakes her foes more sure ensnare, 
than they did lovers once, when shining hair.

book the fifth

the story of perseus continu'd 

while perseus entertain'd with this report 
his [[father]] cepheus, and the list'ning court, 
within the palace walls was heard aloud 
the roaring noise of some unruly crowd; 
not like the songs [[song]] which chearful [[friends]] prepare 
for nuptial days, but sounds that threaten'd [[war]]; 
and all the pleasures [[pleasure]] of this [[happy]] feast, 
to tumult turn'd, in wild disorder ceas'd: 
so, when the sea is calm, we often find 
a storm rais'd sudden by some furious wind. 
chief in the riot phineus first appear'd, 
the rash ringleader of this boist'rous herd, 
and brandishing his brazen-pointed lance, 
behold, he said, an injur'd [[man]] advance, 
stung with resentment for his ravish'd [[wife]], 
nor shall thy wings, o perseus, save thy [[life]]; 
nor jove himself; tho' we've been often told 
who got thee in the form of tempting gold. 
his lance was aim'd, when cepheus ran, and said, 
hold, [[brother]], hold; what brutal rage has made 
your frantick [[mind]] so black a crime conceive? 
are these the thanks that you to perseus give? 
this the [[reward]] that to his worth you [[pay]], 
whose timely valour sav'd andromeda? 
nor was it he, if you would [[reason]] [[right]], 
that forc'd her from you, but the [[jealous]] spight 
of envious nereids, and jove's high decree; 
and that devouring monster of the sea, 
that ready with his jaws wide gaping stood 
to [[eat]] my child, the fairest of my [[blood]]. 
you lost her then, when she seem'd [[past]] relief, 
and wish'd perhaps her [[death]], to ease your [[grief]] 
with my afflictions: not content to view 
andromeda in chains, unhelp'd by you, 
her spouse, and uncle; will you grieve that he 
expos'd his [[life]] the dying maid to [[free]]? 
and shall you claim his [[merit]]? had you [[thought]] 
her charms so [[great]], you shou'd have bravely sought 
that blessing on the rocks, where fix'd she lay: 
but now let perseus bear his prize away, 
by service gain'd, by promis'd [[faith]] possess'd; 
to him i owe it, that my [[age]] is bless'd 
still with a child: nor [[think]] that i prefer 
perseus to thee, but to the loss of her. 

phineus on him, and perseus, roul'd about 
his [[eyes]] in silent rage, and seem'd to [[doubt]] 
which to [[destroy]]; 'till, resolute at length, 
he threw his spear with the redoubled [[strength]] 
his fury gave him, and at perseus struck; 
but missing perseus, in his seat it stuck. 
who, springing nimbly up, return'd the dart, 
and almost plung'd it in his rival's [[heart]]; 
but he for safety to the altar ran, 
unfit protection for so vile a [[man]]; 
yet was the stroke not [[vain]], as rhaetus found, 
who in his brow receiv'd a mortal wound; 
headlong he tumbled, when his skull was broke, 
from which his [[friends]] the fatal weapon took, 
while he lay trembling, and his gushing [[blood]] 
in crimson streams around the table flow'd. 

but this provok'd th' unruly rabble worse, 
they flung their darts, and some in loud discourse 
to [[death]] [[young]] perseus, and the monarch doom; 
but cepheus left before the guilty room, 
with [[grief]] appealing to the gods above, 
who laws [[law]] of hospitality approve, 
who [[faith]] [[protect]], and succour injur'd [[right]], 
that he was guiltless of this barb'rous [[fight]]. 

pallas her [[brother]] perseus close attends, 
and with her ample shield from harm defends, 
raising a sprightly [[courage]] in his [[heart]]: 
but [[indian]] athis took the weaker part, 
born in the chrystal grottoes of the sea, 
limnate's [[son]], a fenny [[nymph]], and she 
daughter of ganges; graceful was his mein, 
his [[person]] lovely, and his [[age]] sixteen. 
his habit made his native [[beauty]] more; 
a purple mantle fring'd with gold he wore; 
his neck well-turn'd with golden chains was grac'd, 
his hair with myrrh perfum'd, was nicely dress'd. 
tho' with just aim he cou'd the javelin throw, 
yet with more [[skill]] he drew the bending bow; 
and now was drawing it with artful hand, 
when perseus snatching up a flaming brand, 
whirl'd sudden at his face the burning wood, 
crush'd his [[eyes]] in, and quench'd the [[fire]] with [[blood]]; 
thro' the soft skin the splinter'd bones appear, 
and spoil'd the face that lately was so [[fair]]. 

when lycabas his athis thus beheld, 
how was his [[heart]] with friendly [[horror]] fill'd! 
a [[youth]] so [[noble]], to his [[soul]] so dear, 
to see his shapeless look, his dying groans to hear! 
he snatch'd the bow the boy was us'd to bend, 
and cry'd, with me, false traytor, dare contend; 
boast not a [[conquest]] o'er a child, but try 
thy [[strength]] with me, who all thy pow'rs defy; 
nor [[think]] so mean an act a [[victory]]. 
while yet he spoke he flung the whizzing dart, 
which pierc'd the plaited robe, but miss'd his [[heart]]: 
perseus defy'd, upon him fiercely press'd 
with [[sword]], unsheath'd, and plung'd it in his breast; 
his [[eyes]] o'erwhelm'd with night, he stumbling falls, 
and with his latest breath on athis calls; 
pleas'd that so near the lovely [[youth]] he lies [[lie]], 
he sinks his head upon his friend, and dies. 

next eager phorbas, old methion's [[son]], 
came rushing forward with amphimedon; 
when the smooth pavement, slippery made with gore, 
trip'd up their feet, and flung 'em on the floor; 
the [[sword]] of perseus, who by [[chance]] was nigh, 
prevents their rise, and where they fall, they lye: 
full in his ribs amphimedon he smote, 
and then stuck fiery phorbas in the throat. 
eurythus lifting up his ax, the blow 
was thus prevented by his nimble foe; 
a golden cup he seizes, high embost, 
and at his head the massy goblet tost: 
it hits, and from his forehead bruis'd rebounds, 
and [[blood]], and brains he vomits from his wounds; 
with his slain fellows on the floor he lies [[lie]], 
and [[death]] for ever shuts his swimming [[eyes]]. 
then polydaemon fell, a goddess-born; 
phlegias, and elycen with locks unshorn 
next follow'd; next, the stroke of [[death]] he gave 
to clytus, abanis, and lycetus brave; 
while o'er unnumber'd heaps of ghastly [[dead]], 
the argive heroe's feet triumphant tread. 

but phineus stands aloof, and dreads to [[feel]] 
his rival's [[force]], and flies his pointed steel: 
yet threw a dart from far; by [[chance]] it lights [[light]] 
on idas, who for neither party fights; 
but wounded, sternly thus to phineus said, 
since of a neuter thou a foe hast made, 
this i return thee, drawing from his side 
the dart; which, as he strove to fling, he dy'd. 
odites fell by clymenus's [[sword]], 
the cephen court had not a greater [[lord]]. 
hypseus his blade does in protenor sheath, 
but brave lyncides soon reveng'd his [[death]]. 
here too was old emathion, one that fear'd 
the gods, and in the cause of heav'n appear'd, 
who only wishing the [[success]] of [[right]], 
and, by his [[age]], exempted from the [[fight]], 
both sides alike condemns: this impious [[war]] 
cease, cease, he cries; these bloody broils forbear. 
this scarce the sage with high concern had said, 
when chromis at a blow struck off his head, 
which dropping, on the [[royal]] altar roul'd, 
still staring on the crowd with aspect bold; 
and still it seem'd their horrid strife to blame, 
in [[life]] and [[death]], his pious zeal the same; 
while clinging to the horns, the trunk expires, 
the sever'd head consumes amidst the fires [[fire]]. 

then phineus, who from far his javelin threw, 
broteas and ammon, twins and brothers [[brother]], slew; 
for knotted gauntlets matchless in the field; 
but gauntlets must to swords [[sword]] and javelins yield. 
ampycus next, with hallow'd fillets bound, 
as ceres' [[priest]], and with a mitre crown'd, 
his spear transfix'd, and struck him to the ground. 

o iapetides, with [[pain]] i tell 
how you, sweet lyrist, in the riot fell; 
what worse than brutal rage his breast could fill, 
who did thy [[blood]], o bard celestial! spill? 
kindly you press'd amid the princely throng, 
to [[crown]] the feast, and give the nuptial [[song]]: 
discord abhorr'd the musick of thy lyre, 
whose notes did gentle [[peace]] so well inspire; 
thee, when fierce pettalus far off espy'd, 
defenceless with thy harp, he scoffing cry'd, 
go; to the ghosts thy soothing lessons play; 
we loath thy lyre, and scorn thy peaceful lay: 
and, as again he fiercely bid him go, 
he pierc'd his temples with a mortal blow. 
his harp he held, tho' sinking on the ground, 
whose strings in [[death]] his trembling fingers found 
by [[chance]], and tun'd by [[chance]] a dying sound. 

with [[grief]] lycormas saw him fall, from far, 
and, wresting from the door a massy bar, 
full in his poll lays on a load of knocks, 
which stun him, and he falls like a devoted ox. 
another bar pelates would have snach'd, 
but corynthus his motions slily watch'd; 
he darts his weapon from a private stand, 
and rivets to the post his veiny hand: 
when strait a missive spear transfix'd his side, 
by abas thrown, and as he hung, he dy'd. 

melaneus on the prince's side was slain; 
and dorylas, who own'd a fertile plain, 
of nasamonia's fields the wealthy [[lord]], 
whose crowded barns, could scarce contain their board. 
a whizzing spear obliquely gave a blow, 
stuck in his groin, and pierc'd the nerves below; 
his foe behld his [[eyes]] convulsive roul, 
his ebbing veins, and his departing [[soul]]; 
then taunting said, of all thy spacious plain, 
this spot thy only [[property]] remains. 
he left him thus; but had no sooner left, 
than perseus in [[revenge]] his nostrils cleft; 
from his friend's breast the murd'ring dart he drew, 
and the same weapon at the murderer threw; 
his head in halves the darted javelin cut, 
and on each side the brain came issuing out. 

fortune his friend, in deaths [[death]] around he deals, 
and this his lance, and that his faulchion feels [[feel]]: 
now clytius dies; and by a diff'rent wound, 
the twin, his [[brother]] clanis, bites the ground. 
in his rent jaw the bearded weapon sticks, 
and the steel'd dart does clytius' thigh transfix. 
with these mendesian celadon he slew: 
and astreus next, whose [[mother]] was a jew, 
his sire uncertain: then by perseus fell 
aethion, who cou'd things to come foretell; 
but now he knows [[know]] not whence the javelin flies 
that wounds his breast, nor by whose arm he dies. 

the squire to phineus next his valour try'd, 
and fierce agyrtes stain'd with paricide. 

as these are slain, fresh numbers still appear, 
and wage with perseus an unequal [[war]]; 
to rob him of his [[right]], the maid he won, 
by [[honour]], promise, and desert his own. 
with him, the [[father]] of the beauteous bride, 
the [[mother]], and the frighted virgin side; 
with shrieks, and doleful cries they rend the air: 
their shrieks confounded with the din of [[war]], 
with dashing arms, and groanings of the slain, 
they grieve unpitied, and unheard [[complain]]. 
the floor with ruddy streams bellona stains, 
and phineus a new [[war]] with double rage maintains. 

perseus begirt, from all around they pour 
their lances on him, a tempestuous show'r, 
aim'd all at him; a cloud of darts, and spears, 
or blind his [[eyes]], or whistle round his ears. 
their numbers to resist, against the wall 
he guards his back secure, and dares them all. 
here from the left molpeus renews the [[fight]], 
and bold ethemon presses on the [[right]]: 
as when a hungry tyger near him hears 
two lowing herds, a-while he both forbears; 
nor can his hopes [[hope]] of this, or that renounce, 
so [[strong]] he lusts to prey on both at once; 
thus perseus now with that, or this is loth 
to [[war]] distinct:, but fain would fall on both. 
and first chaonian molpeus [[felt]] his blow, 
and fled, and never after fac'd his foe; 
then fierce ethemon, as he turn'd his back, 
hurried with fury, aiming at his neck, 
his brandish'd [[sword]] against the marble struck 
with all his might; the brittle weapon broke, 
and in his throat the point rebounding stuck. 
too slight the wound for [[life]] to issue thence, 
and yet too [[great]] for battel, or defence; 
his arms extended in this piteous [[state]], 
for [[mercy]] he wou'd sue, but sues too late; 
perseus has in his bosom plung'd the [[sword]], 
and, ere he speaks, the wound prevents the word. 

the crowds encreasing, and his [[friends]] distress'd, 
himself by warring multitudes oppress'd: 
since thus unequally you [[fight]], 'tis [[time]], 
he cry'd, to punish your presumptuous crime; 
beware, my [[friends]]; his [[friends]] were soon prepar'd, 
their sight averting, high the head he rear'd, 
and gorgon on his foes severely star'd. 
vain shift! says thescelus, with aspect bold, 
thee, and thy bugbear monster, i behold 
with scorn; he lifts his arm, but ere he threw 
the dart, the heroe to a statue grew. 
in the same posture still the marble stands, 
and holds the warrior's [[weapons]] in its hands. 
amphyx, whom yet this wonder can't alarm, 
heaves at lyncides' breast his impious arm; 
but, while thus daringly he presses on, 
his weapon and his arm are turn'd to stone. 
next nileus, he who vainly said he ow'd 
his origin to nile's prolifick flood; 
who on his shield seven silver rivers bore, 
his birth to witness by the arms he wore; 
full of his sev'n-fold [[father]], thus express'd 
his boast to perseus, and his [[pride]] confess'd: 
see whence we sprung; let this thy comfort be 
in thy sure [[death]], that thou didst [[die]] by me. 
while yet he spoke, the dying accents hung 
in sounds imperfect on his marble tongue; 
tho' chang'd to stone, his lips he seem'd to stretch, 
and thro' th' insensate rock wou'd [[force]] a [[speech]]. 

this eryx saw, but seeing wou'd not own; 
the mischief by your selves, he cries, is done, 
'tis your cold [[courage]] turns your hearts [[heart]] to stone. 
come, [[follow]] me; fall on the stripling boy, 
kill him, and you his magick arms [[destroy]]. 
then rushing on, his arm to strike he rear'd, 
and marbled o'er his varied frame appear'd. 

these for affronting pallas were chastis'd, 
and justly met the [[death]] they had despis'd. 
but brave aconteus, perseus' friend, by [[chance]] 
look'd back, and met the gorgon's fatal glance: 
a statue now become, he ghastly stares, 
and still the foe to mortal combat dares. 
astyages the living likeness knew, 
on the [[dead]] stone with vengeful fury flew; 
but impotent his rage, the jarring blade 
no print upon the solid marble made: 
again, as with redoubled might he struck, 
himself astonish'd in the quarry stuck. 

the vulgar deaths [[death]] 'twere tedious to rehearse, 
and fates [[fate]] below the [[dignity]] of verse; 
their safety in their flight two hundred found, 
two hundred, by medusa's head were ston'd. 
fierce phineus now repents the wrongful [[fight]], 
and views his varied [[friends]], a dreadful sight; 
he knows [[know]] their faces, for their [[help]] he sues, 
and thinks [[think]], not hearing him, that they refuse: 
by name he begs their succour, one by one, 
then doubts [[doubt]] their [[life]], and feels [[feel]] the friendly stone. 
struck with remorse, and conscious of his [[pride]], 
convict of [[sin]], he turn'd his [[eyes]] aside; 
with suppliant mein to perseus thus he prays, 
hence with the head, as far as winds and seas 
can bear thee; hence, o quit the cephen shore, 
and never curse us with medusa more, 
that horrid head, which stiffens into stone 
those impious [[men]] who, daring [[death]], look on. 
i warr'd not with thee out of hate or strife, 
my honest cause was to defend my [[wife]], 
first pledg'd to me; what crime cou'd i suppose, 
to arm my [[friends]], and vindicate my spouse? 
but [[vain]], too late i see, was our design; 
mine was the title, but the [[merit]] thine. 
contending made me guilty, i confess; 
but penitence shou'd make that guilt the less: 
'twas thine to conquer by minerva's pow'r; 
favour'd of heav'n, thy [[mercy]] i implore; 
for [[life]] i sue; the rest to thee i yield; 
in [[pity]], from my sight remove the shield. 

he suing said; nor durst revert his [[eyes]] 
on the grim head: and perseus thus replies: 
coward, what is in me to grant, i will, 
nor [[blood]], unworthy of my valour spill: 
fear not to perish by my vengeful [[sword]], 
from that secure; 'tis all the fates [[fate]] afford. 
where i now see thee, thou shalt still be seen, 
a lasting monument to please our queen; 
there still shall thy betroth'd behold her spouse, 
and find his image in her father's house. 
this said; where phineus turn'd to shun the shield 
full in his face the staring head he held; 
as here and there he strove to turn aside, 
the wonder wrought, the [[man]] was petrify'd: 
all marble was his frame, his humid [[eyes]] 
drop'd tears, which hung upon the stone like ice. 
in suppliant posture, with uplifted hands, 
and fearful look, the guilty statue stands. 

hence perseus to his native [[city]] hies, 
victorious, and rewarded with his prize. 
conquest, o'er praetus the usurper, won, 
he re-instates his grandsire in the [[throne]]. 
praetus, his [[brother]] dispossess'd by might, 
his realm enjoy'd, and still detain'd his [[right]]: 
but perseus pull'd the haughty [[tyrant]] down, 
and to the rightful [[king]] restor'd the [[throne]]. 
weak was th' usurper, as his cause was [[wrong]]; 
where gorgon's head appears, what arms are [[strong]]? 
when perseus to his host the monster held, 
they soon were statues, and their [[king]] expell'd. 

thence, to seriphus with the head he sails, 
whose [[prince]] his story treats as idle tales: 
lord of a little isle, he scorns to seem 
too credulous, but laughs at that, and him. 
yet did he not so much suspect the [[truth]], 
as out of [[pride]], or envy, hate the [[youth]]. 
the argive [[prince]], at his contempt enrag'd, 
to [[force]] his [[faith]] by fatal proof engag'd. 
friends, shut your [[eyes]], he cries; his shield he takes, 
and to the [[king]] expos'd medusa's snakes. 
the monarch [[felt]] the pow'r he wou'd not own, 
and stood convict of folly in the stone. 

minerva's interview with the muses 

thus far minerva was content to rove 
with perseus, offspring of her [[father]] jove: 
now, hid in clouds, seriphus she forsook; 
and to the theban tow'rs her [[journey]] took. 
cythnos and gyaros lying to the [[right]], 
she pass'd unheeded in her eager flight; 
and chusing first on helicon to rest, 
the virgin muses in these words address'd: 

me, the [[strange]] tidings of a new-found spring, 
ye learned sisters, to this mountain bring. 
if all be true that fame's wide rumours tell, 
'twas pegasus discover'd first your well; 
whose piercing hoof gave the soft [[earth]] a blow, 
which broke the surface where these waters flow. 
i saw that horse by miracle obtain 
life, from the [[blood]] of dire medusa slain; 
and now, this [[equal]] prodigy to view, 
from distant isles to fam'd boeotia flew. 

the muse urania said, whatever cause 
so [[great]] a [[goddess]] to this mansion draws; 
our shades are [[happy]] with so bright a guest, 
you, queen, are welcome, and we muses blest. 
what fame has publish'd of our spring is true, 
thanks for our spring to pegasus are due. 
then, with becoming courtesy, she [[led]] 
the [[curious]] stranger to their fountain's head; 
who long survey'd, with wonder, and delight, 
their [[sacred]] water, charming to the sight; 
their ancient groves, dark grottos, shady bow'rs, 
and smiling plains adorn'd with various flow'rs. 
o [[happy]] muses! she with rapture cry'd, 
who, safe from cares [[care]], on this [[fair]] hill reside; 
blest in your seat, and [[free]] your selves to please 
with joys of study, and with glorious ease. 

the [[fate]] of pyreneus 

then one replies: o [[goddess]], fit to guide 
our humble works [[work]], and in our choir preside, 
who sure wou'd wisely to these fields repair, 
to taste our pleasures [[pleasure]], and our labours [[labour]] share, 
were not your [[virtue]], and superior [[mind]] 
to higher [[arts]], and nobler deeds inclin'd; 
justly you [[praise]] our works [[work]], and pleasing seat, 
which all might envy in this soft retreat, 
were we secur'd from dangers, and from harms; 
but maids are frighten'd with the least alarms, 
and none are safe in this licentious [[time]]; 
still fierce pyreneus, and his daring crime, 
with lasting [[horror]] strikes my feeble sight, 
nor is my [[mind]] recover'd from the fright. 
with thracian arms this bold usurper gain'd 
daulis, and phocis, where he proudly reign'd: 
it happen'd once, as thro' his lands [[land]] we went, 
for the bright temple of parnassus bent, 
he met us there, and in his artful [[mind]] 
hiding the faithless action he design'd, 
confer'd on us (whom, oh! too well he knew) 
all honours [[honour]] that to goddesses [[goddess]] are due. 
stop, stop, ye muses, 'tis your friend who calls, 
the [[tyrant]] said; behold the rain that falls 
on ev'ry side, and that ill-boding [[sky]], 
whose lowring face portends more storms are nigh. 
pray make my house your own, and void of [[fear]], 
while this [[bad]] weather lasts, take shelter here. 
gods have made meaner places their resort, 
and, for a cottage, left their shining court. 

oblig'd to stop, by the [[united]] [[force]] 
of pouring rains, and complaisant discourse, 
his courteous invitation we obey, 
and in his hall resolve a-while to stay. 
soon it clear'd up; the clouds began to fly, 
the driving north refin'd the show'ry [[sky]]; 
then to pursue our [[journey]] we began: 
but the false traitor to his portal ran, 
stopt our escape, the door securely barr'd, 
and to our [[honour]], [[violence]] prepar'd. 
but we, transform'd to birds, avoid his snare, 
on pinions rising in the yielding air. 

but he, by [[lust]] and indignation fir'd, 
up to his highest tow'r with speed retir'd, 
and cries, in [[vain]] you from my arms withdrew, 
the way you go your lover will pursue. 
then, in a flying posture wildly plac'd, 
and daring from that height himself to cast, 
the wretch fell headlong, and the ground bestrew'd 
with broken bones, and stains of guilty [[blood]]. 

the story of the pierides 

the muse yet spoke; when they began to hear 
a noise of wings that flutter'd in the air; 
and strait a voice, from some high-spreading bough, 
seem'd to salute the company below. 
the [[goddess]] wonder'd, and inquir'd from whence 
that tongue was heard, that spoke so plainly sense 
(it seem'd to her a [[human]] voice to be, 
but prov'd a bird's; for in a shady tree 
nine magpies perch'd lament their alter'd [[state]], 
and, what they hear, are skilful to repeat). 

the sister to the wondring [[goddess]] said, 
these, foil'd by us, by us were thus repaid. 
these did evippe of paeonia bring 
with nine hard labour-pangs to pella's [[king]]. 
the foolish virgins of their number proud, 
and puff'd with praises [[praise]] of the senseless crowd, 
thro' all achaia, and th' aemonian plains 
defy'd us thus, to match their artless strains; 
no more, ye thespian girls, your notes repeat, 
nor with false harmony the vulgar [[cheat]]; 
in voice or [[skill]], if you with us will vye, 
as many we, in voice or [[skill]] will try. 
surrender you to us, if we excell, 
fam'd aganippe, and medusa's well. 
the [[conquest]] yours, your prize from us shall be 
the aemathian plains to snowy paeone; 
the nymphs [[nymph]] our judges [[judge]]. to dispute the field, 
we [[thought]] a shame; but greater shame to yield. 
on seats of living stone the sisters sit, 
and by the rivers swear to [[judge]] aright. 

the [[song]] of the pierides 

then rises one of the presumptuous throng, 
steps rudely forth, and first begins the [[song]]; 
with [[vain]] address describes the giants' wars [[war]], 
and to the gods their fabled acts prefers. 
she sings, from earth's dark womb how typhon rose, 
and struck with mortal [[fear]] his heav'nly foes. 
how the gods fled to egypt's slimy soil, 
and hid their heads beneath the banks of nile: 
how typhon, from the conquer'd skies [[sky]], pursu'd 
their routed godheads to the sev'n-mouth'd flood; 
forc'd every [[god]], his fury to escape, 
some beastly form to take, or earthly shape. 
jove (so she sung) was chang'd into a ram, 
from whence the horns of libyan ammon came. 
bacchus a goat, [[apollo]] was a crow, 
phaebe a cat; [[die]] [[wife]] of jove a cow, 
whose hue was whiter than the falling snow. 
mercury to a nasty ibis turn'd, 
the [[change]] obscene, afraid of typhon, mourn'd; 
while [[venus]] from a fish protection craves, 
and once more plunges in her native waves. 

she sung, and to her harp her voice apply'd; 
then us again to match her they defy'd. 
but our [[poor]] [[song]], perhaps, for you to hear, 
nor leisure serves, nor is it worth your ear. 
that causeless [[doubt]] remove, o muse rehearse, 
the [[goddess]] cry'd, your ever-grateful verse. 
beneath a chequer'd shade she takes her seat, 
and bids the sister her whole [[song]] repeat. 
the sister thus: calliope we chose 
for the performance. the sweet virgin rose, 
with ivy crown'd she tunes her golden strings, 
and to her harp this composition sings. 

the [[song]] of the muses 

first ceres taught the lab'ring hind to plow 
the pregnant [[earth]], and quickning seed to sow. 
she first for [[man]] did wholsome food provide, 
and with just laws [[law]] the wicked [[world]] supply'd: 
all [[good]] from her deriv'd, to her belong 
the grateful tributes of the muse's [[song]]. 
her more than worthy of our verse we deem, 
oh! were our verse more worthy of the theme. 

jove on the giant [[fair]] trinacria hurl'd, 
and with one bolt reveng'd his starry [[world]]. 
beneath her burning hills tiphaeus lies [[lie]], 
and, strugling always, strives in [[vain]] to rise. 
down does pelorus his [[right]] hand suppress 
tow'rd latium, on the left pachyne weighs. 
his legs are under lilybaeum spread, 
and aetna presses hard his horrid head. 
on his broad back he there extended lies [[lie]], 
and vomits clouds of ashes to the skies [[sky]]. 
oft lab'ring with his load, at [[last]] he tires, 
and spews out in [[revenge]] a flood of fires [[fire]]. 
mountains he struggles to o'erwhelm, and towns; 
earth's inmost bowels quake, and [[nature]] groans. 
his terrors reach the direful [[king]] of hell; 
he fears [[fear]] his throws will to the day reveal 
the realms of night, and fright his trembling ghosts. 

this to prevent, he quits the stygian coasts, 
in his black carr, by sooty horses drawn, 
fair sicily he seeks, and dreads the dawn. 
around her plains he casts his eager [[eyes]], 
and ev'ry mountain to the bottom tries. 
but when, in all the careful search, he saw 
no cause of [[fear]], no ill-suspected flaw; 
secure from harm, and wand'ring on at will, 
venus beheld him from her flow'ry hill: 
when strait the dame her little cupid prest 
with secret rapture to her snowy breast, 
and in these words the flutt'ring boy addrest. 

o thou, my arms, my [[glory]], and my pow'r, 
my [[son]], whom [[men]], and deathless gods adore; 
bend thy sure bow, whose arrows never miss'd, 
no longer let hell's [[king]] thy sway resist; 
take him, while stragling from his dark abodes 
he coasts the kingdoms [[kingdom]] of superior gods. 
if [[sovereign]] jove, if gods who [[rule]] the waves, 
and [[neptune]], who rules [[rule]] them, have been thy slaves [[slave]]; 
shall hell be [[free]]? the [[tyrant]] strike, my [[son]], 
enlarge thy mother's [[empire]], and thy own. 
let not our heav'n be made the mock of hell, 
but pluto to confess thy pow'r compel. 
our [[rule]] is slighted in our native skies [[sky]], 
see pallas, see diana too defies 
thy darts, which ceres' [[daughter]] wou'd despise. 
she too our [[empire]] treats with aukward scorn; 
such insolence no longer's to be born. 
revenge our slighted reign, and with thy dart 
transfix the virgin's to the uncle's [[heart]]. 

she said; and from his quiver strait he drew 
a dart that surely wou'd the [[business]] do. 
she guides his hand, she makes her touch the test, 
and of a thousand arrows chose the [[best]]: 
no feather [[better]] pois'd, a sharper head 
none had, and sooner none, and surer sped. 
he bends his bow, he draws it to his ear, 
thro' pluto's [[heart]] it drives, and fixes there. 

the rape of proserpine 

near enna's walls a spacious lake is spread, 
fam'd for the sweetly-singing swans it bred; 
pergusa is its name: and never more 
were heard, or sweeter on cayster's shore. 
woods [[crown]] the lake; and phoebus ne'er invades 
the tufted fences, or offends the shades: 
fresh fragrant breezes fan the verdant bow'rs, 
and the moist ground smiles with enamel'd flow'rs 
the chearful birds their airy carols sing, 
and the whole year is one eternal spring. 

here, while [[young]] proserpine, among the maids, 
diverts herself in these delicious shades; 
while like a child with busy speed and [[care]] 
she gathers lillies here, and vi'lets there; 
while first to fill her little lap she strives, 
hell's grizly monarch at the shade arrives; 
sees her thus sporting on the flow'ry green, 
and loves [[love]] the blooming maid, as soon as seen. 
his urgent flame impatient of delay, 
swift as his [[thought]] he seiz'd the beauteous prey, 
and bore her in his sooty carr away. 
the frighted [[goddess]] to her [[mother]] cries, 
but all in [[vain]], for now far off she flies; 
far she behind her leaves her virgin train; 
to them too cries, and cries to them in [[vain]], 
and, while with passion she repeats her call, 
the vi'lets from her lap, and lillies fall: 
she misses 'em, [[poor]] heart! and makes new moan; 
her lillies, ah! are lost, her vi'lets gone. 

o'er hills, the ravisher, and vallies speeds, 
by name encouraging his foamy steeds; 
he rattles o'er their necks the rusty reins, 
and ruffles with the stroke their shaggy manes. 
o'er lakes he whirls his flying wheels, and comes 
to the palici breathing sulph'rous fumes. 
and thence to where the bacchiads of renown 
between unequal havens built their town; 
where arethusa, round th' imprison'd sea, 
extends her crooked coast to cyane; 
the [[nymph]] who gave the neighb'ring lake a name, 
of all sicilian nymphs [[nymph]] the first in fame, 
she from the waves advanc'd her beauteous head, 
the [[goddess]] knew, and thus to pluto said: 
farther thou shalt not with the virgin run; 
ceres unwilling, canst thou be her [[son]]? 
the maid shou'd be by sweet perswasion won. 
force suits not with the softness of the [[fair]]; 
for, if [[great]] things with small i may compare, 
me anapis once lov'd; a milder course 
he took, and won me by his words, not [[force]]. 

then, stretching out her arms, she stopt his way; 
but he, impatient of the shortest stay, 
throws to his dreadful steeds the slacken'd rein, 
and strikes his iron sceptre thro' the main; 
the depths profound thro' yielding waves he cleaves, 
and to hell's center a [[free]] passage leaves; 
down sinks his chariot, and his realms of night 
the [[god]] soon reaches with a rapid flight. 

cyane dissolves to a fountain 

but still does cyane the rape bemoan, 
and with the goddess' wrongs [[wrong]] laments her own; 
for the stoln maid, and for her injur'd spring, 
time to her trouble no relief can bring. 
in her [[sad]] [[heart]] a heavy load she bears, 
'till the dumb [[sorrow]] turns her all to tears. 
her mingling waters with that fountain pass, 
of which she late [[immortal]] [[goddess]] was; 
her varied members to a fluid melt, 
a pliant softness in her bones is [[felt]]; 
her wavy locks first drop away in dew, 
and liquid next her slender fingers grew. 
the body's [[change]] soon seizes its extreme, 
her legs dissolve, and feet flow off in stream. 
her arms, her back, her shoulders, and her side, 
her swelling breasts in little currents glide, 
a silver liquor only now remains 
within the channel of her purple veins; 
nothing to fill love's grasp; her husband chaste 
bathes in that bosom he before embrac'd. 

a boy transform'd to an eft 

thus, while thro' all the [[earth]], and all the main, 
her [[daughter]] mournful ceres sought in [[vain]]; 
aurora, when with dewy looks she rose, 
nor burnish'd vesper found her in repose, 
at aetna's flaming mouth two pitchy pines 
to [[light]] her in her search at length she tines. 
restless, with these, thro' frosty night she goes, 
nor fears [[fear]] the cutting winds, nor heeds the snows; 
and, when the morning-star the day renews, 
from east to west her absent child pursues. 

thirsty at [[last]] by long fatigue she grows, 
but meets no spring, no riv'let near her flows. 
then looking round, a lowly cottage spies, 
smoaking among the trees, and thither hies. 
the [[goddess]] knocking at the little door, 
'twas open'd by a woman old and [[poor]], 
who, when she begg'd for water, gave her ale 
brew'd long, but well preserv'd from being stale. 
the [[goddess]] drank; a chuffy lad was by, 
who saw the liquor with a grutching eye, 
and grinning cries, she's greedy more than dry. 

ceres, offended at his foul grimace, 
flung what she had not drunk into his face, 
the sprinklings speckle where they hit the skin, 
and a long tail does from his [[body]] spin; 
his arms are turn'd to legs, and lest his size 
shou'd make him mischievous, and he might rise 
against [[mankind]], diminutives his frame, 
less than a lizzard, but in shape the same. 
amaz'd the dame the wondrous sight beheld, 
and weeps, and fain wou'd touch her quondam child. 
yet her approach th' affrighted vermin shuns, 
and fast into the [[greatest]] crevice runs. 
a name they gave him, which the spots exprest, 
that rose like stars, and varied all his breast. 

what lands [[land]], what seas the [[goddess]] wander'd o'er, 
were long to tell; for there remain'd no more. 
searching all round, her fruitless toil she mourns, 
and with regret to sicily returns. 
at length, where cyane now flows, she came, 
who cou'd have told her, were she still the same 
as when she saw her [[daughter]] sink to hell; 
but what she knows [[know]] she wants a tongue to tell. 
yet this plain signal manifestly gave, 
the virgin's girdle floating on a wave, 
as late she dropt it from her slender waste, 
when with her uncle thro' the deep she [[past]]. 
ceres the token by her [[grief]] confest, 
and tore her golden hair, and beat her breast. 
she knows [[know]] not on what [[land]] her curse shou'd fall, 
but, as ingrate, alike upbraids them all, 
unworthy of her gifts; trinacria most, 
where the [[last]] steps she found of what she lost. 
the plough for this the vengeful [[goddess]] broke, 
and with one [[death]] the ox, and owner struck, 
in [[vain]] the fallow fields the peasant tills, 
the seed, corrupted ere 'tis sown, she kills. 
the fruitful soil, that once such harvests bore, 
now mocks the farmer's [[care]], and teems no more. 
and the [[rich]] grain which fills the furrow'd glade, 
rots in the seed, or shrivels in the blade; 
or too much sun burns up, or too much rain 
drowns, or black blights [[destroy]] the blasted plain; 
or greedy birds the new-sown seed devour, 
or darnel, thistles, and a crop impure 
of knotted grass along the acres stand, 
and spread their thriving roots thro' all the [[land]]. 

then from the waves soft arethusa rears 
her head, and back she flings her dropping hairs. 
o [[mother]] of the maid, whom thou so far 
hast sought, of whom thou canst no tidings hear; 
o thou, she cry'd, who art [[arts]] to [[life]] a friend, 
cease here thy search, and let thy [[labour]] end. 
thy faithful sicily's a guiltless clime, 
and shou'd not suffer for another's crime; 
she neither knew, nor cou'd prevent the deed; 
nor [[think]] that for my [[country]] thus i plead; 
my country's pisa, i'm an alien here, 
yet these abodes to elis i prefer, 
no clime to me so sweet, no place so dear. 
these springs i arethusa now possess, 
and this my seat, o gracious [[goddess]], bless: 
this island why i [[love]], and why i crost 
such spacious seas to reach ortygia's coast, 
to you i shall impart, when, void of [[care]], 
your heart's at ease, and you're more fit to hear; 
when on your brow no pressing [[sorrow]] sits, 
for [[gay]] content alone such tales admits. 
when thro' earth's caverns i a-while have roul'd 
my waves, i rise, and here again behold 
the long-lost stars; and, as i late did glide 
near styx, proserpina there i espy'd. 
fear still with [[grief]] might in her face be seen; 
she still her rape laments; yet, made a queen, 
beneath those gloomy shades her sceptre sways, 
and ev'n th' infernal [[king]] her will obeys. 

this heard, the [[goddess]] like a statue stood, 
stupid with [[grief]]; and in that musing mood 
continu'd long; new cares [[care]] a-while supprest 
the reigning of her [[immortal]] breast. 
at [[last]] to jove her daughter's sire she flies, 
and with her chariot cuts the chrystal skies [[sky]]; 
she comes in clouds, and with dishevel'd hair, 
standing before his [[throne]], prefers her pray'r. 

king of the gods, defend my [[blood]] and thine, 
and use it not the worse for being mine. 
if i no more am gracious in thy sight, 
be just, o jove, and do thy [[daughter]] [[right]]. 
in [[vain]] i sought her the wide [[world]] around, 
and, when i most despair'd to find her, found. 
but how can i the fatal finding boast, 
by which i [[know]] she is for ever lost? 
without her father's aid, what other pow'r 
can to my arms the ravish'd maid restore? 
let him restore her, i'll the crime [[forgive]]; 
my child, tho' ravish'd, i'd with joy receive. 
pity, your [[daughter]] with a thief shou'd wed, 
tho' mine, you [[think]], deserves no [[better]] bed. 

jove thus replies: it equally belongs 
to both, to guard our [[common]] pledge from wrongs [[wrong]]. 
but if to things we proper names apply, 
this hardly can be call'd an injury. 
the theft is [[love]]; nor need we blush to own 
the thief, if i can [[judge]], to be our [[son]]. 
had you of his desert no other proof, 
to be jove's [[brother]] is methinks enough. 
nor was my [[throne]] by worth superior got, 
heav'n fell to me, as hell to him, by lot: 
if you are still resolv'd her loss to mourn, 
and nothing less will serve than her return; 
upon these terms she may again be yours 
(th' irrevocable terms of [[fate]], not ours), 
of stygian food if she did never taste, 
hell's bounds may then, and only then, be [[past]]. 

the transformation of ascalaphus into an owl 

the [[goddess]] now, resolving to succeed, 
down to the gloomy shades descends with speed; 
but adverse [[fate]] had otherwise decreed. 
for, long before, her giddy thoughtless child 
had broke her fast, and all her projects spoil'd. 
as in the garden's shady walk she stray'd, 
a [[fair]] pomegranate charm'd the simple maid, 
hung in her way, and tempting her to taste, 
she pluck'd the fruit, and took a short repast. 
seven times [[time]], a seed at once, she [[eat]] the food; 
the [[fact]] ascalaphus had only view'd; 
whom acheron begot in stygian shades 
on orphne, fam'd among avernal maids; 
he saw what [[past]], and by discov'ring all, 
detain'd the ravish'd [[nymph]] in cruel thrall. 

but now a queen, she with resentment heard, 
and chang'd the vile informer to a bird. 
in phlegeton's black stream her hand she dips, 
sprinkles his head, and wets his babling lips. 
soon on his face, bedropt with magick dew, 
a [[change]] appear'd, and gawdy feathers grew. 
a crooked beak the place of nose supplies, 
rounder his head, and larger are his [[eyes]]. 
his arms and [[body]] waste, but are supply'd 
with yellow pinions flagging on each side. 
his nails grow crooked, and are turn'd to claws, 
and lazily along his heavy wings he draws. 
ill-omen'd in his form, the unlucky fowl, 
abhorr'd by [[men]], and call'd a scrieching owl. 

the daughters [[daughter]] of achelous transform'd to sirens 

justly this [[punishment]] was due to him, 
and less had been too little for his crime; 
but, o ye nymphs [[nymph]] that from the flood descend, 
what [[fault]] of yours the gods cou'd so offend, 
with wings and claws your beauteous forms to spoil, 
yet save your maiden face, and winning smile? 
were you not with her in pergusa's bow'rs, 
when proserpine went forth to gather flow'rs? 
since pluto in his carr the [[goddess]] caught, 
have you not for her in each [[climate]] sought? 
and when on [[land]] you long had search'd in [[vain]], 
you wish'd for wings to cross the pathless main; 
that [[earth]] and sea might witness to your [[care]]: 
the gods were easy, and return'd your pray'r; 
with golden wing o'er foamy waves you fled, 
and to the sun your plumy glories spread. 
but, lest the soft enchantment of your songs [[song]], 
and the sweet musick of your flat'ring tongues 
shou'd quite be lost (as courteous fates [[fate]] ordain), 
your voice and virgin [[beauty]] still remain. 

jove some amends for ceres lost to make, 
yet willing pluto shou'd the joy partake, 
gives 'em of proserpine an [[equal]] share, 
who, claim'd by both, with both divides the year. 
the [[goddess]] now in either [[empire]] sways, 
six moons in hell, and six with ceres stays. 
her peevish temper's chang'd; that sullen [[mind]], 
which made ev'n hell uneasy, now is [[kind]], 
her voice refines, her mein more sweet appears, 
her forehead [[free]] from frowns, her [[eyes]] from tears, 
as when, with golden [[light]], the conqu'ring day 
thro' dusky exhalations clears a way. 
ceres her daughter's rape no longer mourn'd, 
but back to arethusa's spring return'd; 
and sitting on the margin, bid her tell 
from whence she came, and why a [[sacred]] well. 

the story of arethusa 

still were the purling waters, and the maid 
from the smooth surface rais'd her beauteous head, 
wipes off the drops that from her tresses ran, 
and thus to tell alpheus' loves [[love]] began. 

in elis first i breath'd the living air, 
the chase was all my [[pleasure]], all my [[care]]. 
none lov'd like me the forest to explore, 
to pitch the toils, and drive the bristled boar. 
of [[fair]], tho' masculine, i had the name, 
but gladly wou'd to that have quitted claim: 
it less my [[pride]] than indignation rais'd, 
to hear the [[beauty]] i neglected, prais'd; 
such compliments i loath'd, such charms as these 
i scorn'd, and [[thought]] it infamy to please. 

once, i [[remember]], in the summer's heat, 
tir'd with the chase, i sought a cool retreat; 
and, walking on, a silent current found, 
which gently glided o'er the grav'ly ground. 
the chrystal water was so smooth, so clear, 
my eye distinguish'd ev'ry pebble there. 
so soft its motion, that i scarce perceiv'd 
the running stream, or what i saw believ'd. 
the hoary willow, and the poplar, made 
along the shelving bank a grateful shade. 
in the cool rivulet my feet i dipt, 
then waded to the knee, and then i stript; 
my robe i careless on an osier threw, 
that near the place commodiously grew; 
nor long upon the border naked stood, 
but plung'd with speed into the silver flood. 
my arms a thousand ways i mov'd, and try'd 
to quicken, if i cou'd, the lazy tide; 
where, while i play'd my swimming gambols o'er, 
i heard a murm'ring voice, and frighted sprung to shore.

oh! whither, arethusa, dost thou fly? 
from the brook's bottom did alpheus cry; 
again, i heard him, in a hollow tone, 
oh! whither, arethusa, dost thou run? 
naked i flew, nor cou'd i stay to hide 
my limbs, my robe was on the other side; 
alpheus follow'd fast, th' inflaming sight 
quicken'd his speed, and made his [[labour]] [[light]]; 
he sees me ready for his eager arms, 
and with a greedy glance devours my charms. 
as trembling doves from pressing danger fly, 
when the fierce hawk comes sousing from the [[sky]]; 
and, as fierce hawks the trembling doves pursue, 
from him i fled, and after me he flew. 
first by orchomenus i took my flight, 
and soon had psophis and cyllene in sight; 
behind me then high maenalus i lost, 
and craggy erimanthus scal'd with frost; 
elis was next; thus far the ground i trod 
with nimble feet, before the distanc'd [[god]]. 
but here i lagg'd, unable to sustain 
the [[labour]] longer, and my flight maintain; 
while he more [[strong]], more patient of the toil, 
and fir'd with hopes [[hope]] of beauty's speedy spoil, 
gain'd my lost ground, and by redoubled pace, 
now left between us but a narrow space. 
unweary'd i 'till now o'er hills, and plains, 
o'er rocks, and rivers ran, and [[felt]] no pains [[pain]]: 
the sun behind me, and the [[god]] i kept, 
but, when i fastest shou'd have run, i stept. 
before my feet his shadow now appear'd; 
as what i saw, or rather what i fear'd. 
yet there i could not be deceiv'd by [[fear]], 
who [[felt]] his breath pant on my braided hair, 
and heard his sounding tread, and knew him to be near. 
tir'd, and despairing, o celestial maid, 
i'm caught, i cry'd, without thy heav'nly aid. 
help me, diana, [[help]] a [[nymph]] forlorn, 
devoted to the woods, who long has worn 
thy livery, and long thy quiver born. 
the [[goddess]] heard; my pious pray'r prevail'd; 
in muffling clouds my virgin head was veil'd, 
the am'rous [[god]], deluded of his hopes [[hope]], 
searches the gloom, and thro' the darkness gropes; 
twice, where diana did her servant hide 
he came, and twice, o arethusa! cry'd. 
how shaken was my [[soul]], how sunk my heart! 
the terror seiz'd on ev'ry trembling part. 
thus when the wolf about the mountain prowls 
for prey, the lambkin hears his horrid howls: 
the tim'rous hare, the pack approaching nigh, 
thus hearkens to the hounds, and trembles at the cry; 
nor dares she stir, for [[fear]] her scented breath 
direct the dogs, and guide the threaten'd [[death]]. 
alpheus in the cloud no traces found 
to mark my way, yet stays to guard the ground, 
the [[god]] so near, a chilly sweat possest 
my fainting limbs, at ev'ry pore exprest; 
my [[strength]] distill'd in drops, my hair in dew, 
my form was chang'd, and all my substance new. 
each motion was a stream, and my whole frame 
turn'd to a fount, which still preserves my name. 
resolv'd i shou'd not his embrace escape, 
again the [[god]] resumes his fluid shape; 
to mix his streams with mine he fondly tries, 
but still diana his attempt denies. 
she cleaves the ground; thro' caverns dark i run 
a diff'rent current, while he keeps his own. 
to dear ortygia she conducts my way, 
and here i first review the welcome day. 

here arethusa stopt; then ceres takes 
her golden carr, and yokes her fiery snakes; 
with a just rein, along mid-heaven she flies 
o'er [[earth]], and seas, and cuts the yielding skies [[sky]]. 
she halts at [[athens]], dropping like a star, 
and to triptolemus resigns her carr. 
parent of seed, she gave him fruitful grain, 
and [[bad]] him [[teach]] to till and plough the plain; 
the seed to sow, as well in fallow fields, 
as where the soil manur'd a richer harvest yields. 

the transformation of lyncus 

the [[youth]] o'er [[europe]] and o'er [[asia]] drives, 
'till at the court of lyncus he arrives. 
the [[tyrant]] scythia's barb'rous [[empire]] sway'd; 
and, when he saw triptolemus, he said, 
how cam'st thou, stranger, to our court, and why? 
thy [[country]], and thy name? the [[youth]] did thus reply: 
triptolemus my name; my country's known 
o'er all the [[world]], minerva's fav'rite town, 
athens, the first of cities [[city]] in renown. 
by [[land]] i neither walk'd, nor sail'd by sea, 
but hither thro' the aether made my way. 
by me, the [[goddess]] who the fields befriends, 
these gifts, the [[greatest]] of all blessings, sends. 
the grain she gives if in your soil you sow, 
thence wholsom food in golden crops shall grow. 

soon as the secret to the [[king]] was known, 
he grudg'd the [[glory]] of the service done, 
and wickedly resolv'd to make it all his own. 
to hide his [[purpose]], he invites his guest, 
the friend of ceres, to a [[royal]] feast, 
and when sweet sleep his heavy [[eyes]] had seiz'd, 
the [[tyrant]] with his steel attempts his breast. 
him strait a lynx's shape the [[goddess]] gives, 
and [[home]] the [[youth]] her [[sacred]] dragons drives. 

the pierides transform'd to magpies 

the chosen muse here ends her [[sacred]] lays; 
the nymphs [[nymph]] unanimous decree the bays, 
and give the heliconian goddesses [[goddess]] the [[praise]]. 
then, far from [[vain]] that we shou'd thus prevail, 
but much provok'd to hear the vanquish'd rail, 
calliope resumes: too long we've born 
your daring taunts, and your affronting scorn; 
your challenge justly merited a curse, 
and this unmanner'd railing makes it worse. 
since you refuse us calmly to enjoy 
our patience, next our [[passions]] we'll employ; 
the dictates of a [[mind]] enrag'd pursue, 
and, what our just resentment bids us, do. 

the railers laugh, our threats and wrath despise, 
and clap their hands, and make a scolding noise: 
but in the [[fact]] they're seiz'd; beneath their nails 
feathers they [[feel]], and on their faces scales; 
their horny beaks at once each other scare, 
their arms are plum'd, and on their backs they bear 
py'd wings, and flutter in the fleeting air. 
chatt'ring, the scandal of the woods they fly, 
and there continue still their clam'rous cry: 
the same their eloquence, as maids, or birds, 
now only noise, and nothing then but words.

book the sixth

the transformation of arachne into a spider 

pallas, attending to the muse's [[song]], 
approv'd the just resentment of their [[wrong]]; 
and thus reflects: while tamely i commend 
those who their injur'd deities defend, 
my own divinity affronted stands, 
and calls aloud for [[justice]] at my hands; 
then takes the hint, asham'd to lag behind, 
and on arachne' bends her vengeful [[mind]]; 
one at the loom so excellently skill'd, 
that to the [[goddess]] she refus'd to yield. 
low was her birth, and small her native town, 
she from her art [[arts]] alone obtain'd renown. 
idmon, her [[father]], made it his employ, 
to give the spungy fleece a purple dye: 
of vulgar strain her [[mother]], lately [[dead]], 
with her own rank had been content to wed; 
yet she their [[daughter]], tho' her [[time]] was spent 
in a small hamlet, and of mean descent, 
thro' the [[great]] towns of lydia gain'd a name, 
and fill'd the neighb'ring countries [[country]] with her fame. 

oft, to [[admire]] the niceness of her [[skill]], 
the nymphs [[nymph]] would quit their fountain, shade, or hill: 
thither, from green tymolus, they repair, 
and leave the vineyards, their peculiar [[care]]; 
thither, from fam'd pactolus' golden stream, 
drawn by her art [[arts]], the [[curious]] naiads came. 
nor would the [[work]], when finish'd, please so much, 
as, while she wrought, to view each graceful touch; 
whether the shapeless wool in balls she wound, 
or with quick motion turn'd the spindle round, 
or with her pencil drew the neat design, 
pallas her mistress shone in every line. 
this the proud maid with scornful air denies, 
and ev'n the [[goddess]] at her [[work]] defies; 
disowns her heav'nly mistress ev'ry hour, 
nor asks her aid, nor deprecates her pow'r. 
let us, she cries, but to a tryal come, 
and, if she conquers, let her fix my doom. 

the [[goddess]] then a beldame's form put on, 
with silver hairs her hoary temples shone; 
prop'd by a staff, she hobbles in her walk, 
and tott'ring thus begins her old wives' talk. 

young maid attend, nor stubbornly despise 
the admonitions of the old, and [[wise]]; 
for [[age]], tho' scorn'd, a ripe [[experience]] bears, 
that golden fruit, unknown to blooming years: 
still may remotest fame your labours [[labour]] [[crown]], 
and mortals your superior genius own; 
but to the [[goddess]] yield, and humbly meek 
a pardon for your bold presumption seek; 
the [[goddess]] will [[forgive]]. at this the maid, 
with passion fir'd, her gliding shuttle stay'd; 
and, darting vengeance with an angry look, 
to pallas in [[disguise]] thus fiercely spoke. 

thou doating thing, whose idle babling tongue 
but too well shews the plague of living long; 
hence, and reprove, with this your sage [[advice]], 
your giddy [[daughter]], or your aukward neice; 
know, i despise your counsel, and am still 
a woman, ever wedded to my will; 
and, if your skilful [[goddess]] [[better]] knows [[know]], 
let her accept the tryal i propose. 

she does, impatient pallas strait replies, 
and, cloath'd with heavenly [[light]], sprung from her odd [[disguise]].

the nymphs [[nymph]], and virgins of the plain adore 
the awful [[goddess]], and confess her pow'r; 
the maid alone stood unappall'd; yet show'd 
a transient blush, that for a moment glow'd, 
then disappear'd; as purple streaks adorn 
the opening beauties [[beauty]] of the rosy morn; 
till phoebus rising prevalently bright, 
allays the tincture with his silver [[light]]. 
yet she persists, and obstinately [[great]], 
in hopes [[hope]] of [[conquest]] hurries on her [[fate]]. 
the [[goddess]] now the challenge waves no more, 
nor, kindly [[good]], advises as before. 
strait to their posts appointed both repair, 
and fix their threaded looms with [[equal]] [[care]]: 
around the solid beam the web is ty'd, 
while hollow canes the parting warp divide; 
thro' which with nimble flight the shuttles play, 
and for the woof prepare a ready way; 
the woof and warp unite, press'd by the toothy slay. 

thus both, their mantles button'd to their breast, 
their skilful fingers ply with willing haste, 
and [[work]] with [[pleasure]]; while they chear the eye 
with glowing purple of the tyrian dye: 
or, justly intermixing shades with [[light]], 
their colourings insensibly unite. 
as when a show'r transpierc'd with sunny rays, 
its mighty arch along the heav'n displays; 
from whence a thousand diff'rent colours rise, 
whose fine transition cheats the clearest [[eyes]]; 
so like the intermingled shading seems, 
and only differs in the [[last]] extreams. 
then threads of gold both artfully dispose, 
and, as each part in just proportion rose, 
some antique fable in their [[work]] disclose. 

pallas in figures wrought the heav'nly pow'rs, 
and mars's hill among th' athenian tow'rs. 
on lofty thrones twice six celestials sate, 
jove in the midst, and held their warm debate; 
the [[subject]] weighty, and well-known to fame, 
from whom the [[city]] shou'd receive its name. 
each [[god]] by proper features was exprest, 
jove with majestick mein excell'd the rest. 
his three-fork'd mace the dewy sea-god shook, 
and, looking sternly, smote the ragged rock; 
when from the stone leapt forth a spritely steed, 
and [[neptune]] claims the [[city]] for the deed. 

herself she blazons, with a glitt'ring spear, 
and crested helm that veil'd her braided hair, 
with shield, and scaly breast-plate, implements of [[war]]. 
struck with her pointed launce, the teeming [[earth]] 
seem'd to [[produce]] a new surprizing birth; 
when, from the glebe, the pledge of [[conquest]] sprung, 
a tree pale-green with fairest olives hung. 

and then, to let her giddy rival learn 
what just rewards [[reward]] such boldness was to earn, 
four tryals at each corner had their part, 
design'd in miniature, and touch'd with art [[arts]]. 
haemus in one, and rodope of thrace 
transform'd to mountains, fill'd the foremost place; 
who claim'd the titles of the gods above, 
and vainly us'd the epithets of jove. 
another shew'd, where the pigmaean dame, 
profaning juno's venerable name, 
turn'd to an airy crane, descends from far, 
and with her pigmy subjects [[subject]] wages [[war]]. 
in a third part, the rage of heav'n's [[great]] queen, 
display'd on proud antigone, was seen: 
who with presumptuous boldness dar'd to vye, 
for [[beauty]] with the empress of the [[sky]]. 
ah! what avails her ancient princely [[race]], 
her sire a [[king]], and troy her native place: 
now, to a noisy stork transform'd, she flies, 
and with her whiten'd pinions cleaves the skies [[sky]]. 
and in the [[last]] remaining part was drawn 
poor cinyras that seem'd to weep in stone; 
clasping the temple steps, he sadly mourn'd 
his lovely daughters [[daughter]], now to marble turn'd. 
with her own tree the finish'd piece is crown'd, 
and wreaths of peaceful olive all the [[work]] surround. 

arachne drew the fam'd intrigues of jove, 
chang'd to a bull to gratify his [[love]]; 
how thro' the briny tide all foaming hoar, 
lovely europa on his back he bore. 
the sea seem'd waving, and the trembling maid 
shrunk up her tender feet, as if afraid; 
and, looking back on the forsaken strand, 
to her companions wafts her distant hand. 
next she design'd asteria's fabled rape, 
when jove assum'd a soaring eagle's shape: 
and shew'd how leda lay supinely press'd, 
whilst the soft snowy swan sate hov'ring o'er her breast,

how in a satyr's form the [[god]] beguil'd, 
when [[fair]] antiope with twins he fill'd. 
then, like amphytrion, but a real jove, 
in [[fair]] alcmena's arms he cool'd his [[love]]. 
in fluid gold to danae's [[heart]] he came, 
aegina [[felt]] him in a lambent flame. 
he took mnemosyne in shepherd's make, 
and for deois was a speckled snake. 

she made thee, [[neptune]], like a wanton steer, 
pacing the meads for [[love]] of arne dear; 
next like a stream, thy burning flame to slake, 
and like a ram, for [[fair]] bisaltis' sake. 
then ceres in a steed your vigour try'd, 
nor cou'd the mare the yellow [[goddess]] hide. 
next, to a fowl transform'd, you won by [[force]] 
the snake-hair'd [[mother]] of the winged horse; 
and, in a dolphin's fishy form, subdu'd 
melantho sweet beneath the oozy flood. 

all these the maid with lively features drew, 
and open'd proper landskips to the view. 
there phoebus, roving like a [[country]] swain, 
attunes his jolly pipe along the plain; 
for lovely isse's sake in shepherd's weeds, 
o'er pastures green his bleating flock he feeds, 
there bacchus, imag'd like the clust'ring grape, 
melting bedrops erigone's [[fair]] lap; 
and there old saturn, stung with youthful heat, 
form'd like a stallion, rushes to the feat. 
fresh flow'rs, which twists of ivy intertwine, 
mingling a running foliage, close the neat design. 

this the bright [[goddess]] passionately mov'd, 
with envy saw, yet inwardly approv'd. 
the scene of heav'nly guilt with haste she tore, 
nor longer the affront with patience bore; 
a boxen shuttle in her hand she took, 
and more than once arachne's forehead struck. 
th' unhappy maid, impatient of the [[wrong]], 
down from a beam her injur'd [[person]] hung; 
when pallas, pitying her wretched [[state]], 
at once prevented, and pronounc'd her [[fate]]: 
live; but depend, vile wretch, the [[goddess]] cry'd, 
doom'd in suspence for ever to be ty'd; 
that all your [[race]], to utmost date of [[time]], 
may [[feel]] the vengeance, and detest the crime. 

then, going off, she sprinkled her with juice, 
which leaves of baneful aconite [[produce]]. 
touch'd with the pois'nous drug, her flowing hair 
fell to the ground, and left her temples bare; 
her usual features vanish'd from their place, 
her [[body]] lessen'd all, but most her face. 
her slender fingers, hanging on each side 
with many joynts, the use of legs supply'd: 
a spider's bag the rest, from which she gives 
a thread, and still by constant weaving lives [[life]]. 

the story of niobe 

swift thro' the phrygian towns the rumour flies, 
and the [[strange]] news each female tongue employs: 
niobe, who before she [[married]] knew 
the famous [[nymph]], now found the story true; 
yet, unreclaim'd by [[poor]] arachne's [[fate]], 
vainly above the gods assum'd a [[state]]. 
her husband's fame, their family's descent, 
their pow'r, and [[rich]] dominion's wide extent, 
might well have justify'd a decent [[pride]]; 
but not on these alone the dame rely'd. 
her lovely progeny, that far excell'd, 
the mother's [[heart]] with [[vain]] [[ambition]] swell'd: 
the happiest [[mother]] not unjustly styl'd, 
had no conceited thoughts [[thought]] her tow'ring fancy fill'd. 

for once a prophetess with zeal inspir'd, 
their slow neglect to warm devotion fir'd; 
thro' ev'ry street of thebes who ran possess'd, 
and thus in accents wild her charge express'd: 
haste, haste, ye theban matrons, and adore, 
with hallow'd rites, latona's mighty pow'r; 
and, to the heav'nly twins that from her spring, 
with laurel crown'd, your smoaking incense bring. 
strait the [[great]] summons ev'ry dame obey'd, 
and due submission to the [[goddess]] paid: 
graceful, with laurel chaplets dress'd, they came, 
and offer'd incense in the [[sacred]] flame. 

mean-while, surrounded with a courtly guard, 
the [[royal]] niobe in [[state]] appear'd; 
attir'd in robes embroider'd o'er with gold, 
and mad with rage, yet lovely to behold: 
her comely tresses, trembling as she stood, 
down her fine neck with easy motion flow'd; 
then, darting round a proud disdainful look, 
in haughty tone her hasty passion broke, 
and thus began: what madness this, to court 
a [[goddess]], founded meerly on report? 
dare ye a [[poor]] pretended pow'r invoke, 
while yet no altars to my godhead smoke? 
mine, whose immediate lineage stands confess'd 
from tantalus, the only mortal guest 
that e'er the gods admitted to their feast. 
a sister of the pleiads gave me birth; 
and atlas, mightiest mountain upon [[earth]], 
who bears the globe of all the stars above, 
my grandsire was, and atlas sprung from jove. 
the theban towns my majesty adore, 
and neighb'ring phrygia trembles at my pow'r: 
rais'd by my husband's lute, with turrets crown'd, 
our lofty [[city]] stands secur'd around. 
within my court, where-e'er i turn my [[eyes]], 
unbounded treasures to my prospect rise: 
with these my face i modestly may name, 
as not unworthy of so high a claim; 
seven are my daughters [[daughter]], of a form [[divine]], 
with seven [[fair]] sons [[son]], an indefective line. 
go, fools! consider this; and ask the cause 
from which my [[pride]] its [[strong]] presumption draws; 
consider this; and then prefer to me 
caeus the titan's vagrant progeny; 
to whom, in travel, the whole spacious [[earth]] 
no room afforded for her spurious birth. 
not the least part in [[earth]], in heav'n, or seas, 
would grant your out-law'd [[goddess]] any ease: 
'till pitying hers, from his own wand'ring case, 
delos, the floating island, gave a place. 
there she a [[mother]] was, of two at most; 
only the seventh part of what i boast. 
my joys all are beyond suspicion fix'd; 
with no pollutions of misfortune mix'd; 
safe on the basis of my pow'r i stand, 
above the reach of fortune's fickle hand. 
lessen she may my inexhausted store, 
and much [[destroy]], yet still must leave me more. 
suppose it possible that some may dye 
of this my num'rous lovely progeny; 
still with latona i might safely vye. 
who, by her scanty breed, scarce fit to name, 
but just escapes the childless woman's shame. 
go then, with speed your laurel'd heads uncrown, 
and leave the silly farce you have begun. 

the tim'rous throng their [[sacred]] rites forbore, 
and from their heads the verdant laurel tore; 
their haughty queen they with regret obey'd, 
and still in gentle murmurs softly pray'd. 

high, on the top of cynthus' shady mount, 
with [[grief]] the [[goddess]] saw the base affront; 
and, the [[abuse]] revolving in her breast, 
the [[mother]] her twin-offspring thus addrest. 

lo i, my [[children]], who with comfort knew 
your god-like birth, and thence my [[glory]] drew; 
and thence have claim'd precedency of place 
from all but juno of the heav'nly [[race]], 
must now despair, and languish in disgrace. 
my godhead question'd, and all rites [[divine]], 
unless you succour, banish'd from my shrine. 
nay more, the imp of tantalus has flung 
reflections with her vile paternal tongue; 
has dar'd prefer her mortal breed to mine, 
and call'd me childless; which, just [[fate]], may she repine!

when to urge more the [[goddess]] was prepar'd, 
phoebus in haste replies, too much we've heard, 
and ev'ry moment's lost, while vengeance is defer'd. 
diana spoke the same. then both enshroud 
their heav'nly bodies [[body]] in a sable cloud; 
and to the theban tow'rs descending [[light]], 
thro' the soft yielding air direct their flight. 

without the wall there lies [[lie]] a champian ground 
with even surface, far extending round, 
beaten and level'd, while it daily feels [[feel]] 
the trampling horse, and chariot's grinding wheels. 
part of proud niobe's [[young]] rival breed, 
practising there to ride the manag'd steed, 
their bridles boss'd with gold, were mounted high 
on stately furniture of tyrian dye. 
of these, ismenos, who by birth had been 
the first [[fair]] issue of the fruitful queen, 
just as he drew the rein to guide his horse, 
around the compass of the circling course, 
sigh'd deeply, and the pangs of smart express'd, 
while the shaft stuck, engor'd within his breast: 
and, the reins dropping from his dying hand, 
he sunk quite down, and tumbled on the sand. 
sipylus next the rattling quiver heard, 
and with full speed for his escape prepar'd; 
as when the pilot from the black'ning skies [[sky]] 
a gath'ring storm of wintry rain descries, 
his sails unfurl'd, and crowded all with wind, 
he strives to leave the threat'ning cloud behind: 
so fled the [[youth]]; but an unerring dart 
o'ertook him, quick discharg'd, and sped with art [[arts]]; 
fix'd in his neck behind, it trembling stood, 
and at his throat display'd the point besmear'd with blood

prone, as his posture was, he tumbled o'er, 
and bath'd his courser's mane with steaming gore. 
next at [[young]] phaedimus they took their aim, 
and tantalus who bore his grandsire's name: 
these, when their other exercise was done, 
to try the wrestler's oily [[sport]] begun; 
and, straining ev'ry nerve, their [[skill]] express'd 
in closest grapple, joining breast to breast: 
when from the bending bow an arrow sent, 
joyn'd as they were, thro' both their bodies [[body]] went: 
both groan'd, and writhing both their limbs with [[pain]], 
they fell together bleeding on the plain; 
then both their languid eye-balls faintly roul, 
and thus together breathe away their [[soul]]. 
with [[grief]] alphenor saw their doleful plight, 
and smote his breast, and sicken'd at the sight; 
then to their succour ran with eager haste, 
and, fondly griev'd, their stiff'ning limbs embrac'd; 
but in the action falls: a thrilling dart, 
by phoebus guided, pierc'd him to the [[heart]]. 
this, as they drew it forth, his midriff tore, 
its barbed point the fleshy fragments bore, 
and let the [[soul]] gush out in streams of purple gore. 
but damasichthon, by a double wound, 
beardless, and [[young]], lay gasping on the ground. 
fix'd in his sinewy ham, the steely point 
stuck thro' his knee, and pierc'd the nervous joint: 
and, as he stoop'd to tug the painful dart, 
another struck him in a vital part; 
shot thro' his wezon, by the wing it hung. 
the life-blood forc'd it out, and darting upward sprung,

ilioneus, the [[last]], with terror stands, 
lifting in pray'r his unavailing hands; 
and, ignorant from whom his griefs arise, 
spare me, o all ye heav'nly pow'rs, he cries: 
phoebus was touch'd too late, the sounding bow 
had sent the shaft, and struck the fatal blow; 
which yet but gently gor'd his tender side, 
so by a slight and easy wound he dy'd. 

swift to the mother's ears the rumour came, 
and doleful sighs the heavy news proclaim; 
with anger and surprize inflam'd by turns, 
in furious rage her haughty stomach burns: 
first she disputes th' effects of heav'nly pow'r, 
then at their daring boldness wonders more; 
for [[poor]] amphion with sore [[grief]] distrest, 
hoping to sooth his cares [[care]] by endless rest, 
had sheath'd a dagger in his wretched breast. 
and she, who toss'd her high disdainful head, 
when thro' the streets in solemn pomp she [[led]] 
the throng that from latona's altar fled, 
assuming [[state]] beyond the proudest queen; 
was now the miserablest object seen. 
prostrate among the clay-cold [[dead]] she fell, 
and kiss'd an undistinguish'd [[last]] farewel. 
then her pale arms advancing to the skies [[sky]], 
cruel latona! triumph now, she cries. 
my grieving [[soul]] in bitter anguish drench, 
and with my woes your thirsty passion quench; 
feast your black malice at a price thus dear, 
while the sore pangs of sev'n such deaths [[death]] i bear. 
triumph, too cruel rival, and display 
your conqu'ring standard; for you've won the day. 
yet i'll excel; for yet, tho' sev'n are slain, 
superior still in number i remain. 
scarce had she spoke; the bow-string's twanging sound 
was heard, and dealt fresh terrors all around; 
which all, but niobe alone, confound. 
stunn'd, and obdurate by her load of [[grief]], 
insensible she sits, nor hopes [[hope]] relief. 

before the fun'ral biers, all weeping [[sad]], 
her daughters [[daughter]] stood, in vests of sable clad, 
when one, surpriz'd, and stung with sudden smart, 
in [[vain]] attempts to draw the sticking dart: 
but to grim [[death]] her blooming [[youth]] resigns, 
and o'er her brother's corpse her dying head reclines. 
this, to asswage her mother's anguish tries, 
and, silenc'd in the pious action, dies; 
shot by a secret arrow, wing'd with [[death]], 
her fault'ring lips but only gasp'd for breath. 
one, on her dying sister, breathes her [[last]]; 
vainly in flight another's hopes [[hope]] are plac'd: 
this hiding, from her [[fate]] a shelter seeks; 
that trembling stands, and fills the air with shrieks. 
and all in [[vain]]; for now all six had found 
their way to [[death]], each by a diff'rent wound. 
the [[last]], with eager [[care]] the [[mother]] veil'd, 
behind her spreading mantle close conceal'd, 
and with her [[body]] guarded, as a shield. 
only for this, this youngest, i implore, 
grant me this one request, i ask no more; 
o grant me this! she passionately cries: 
but while she speaks, the destin'd virgin dies. 

the transformation of niobe 

widow'd, and childless, lamentable state! 
a doleful sight, among the [[dead]] she sate; 
harden'd with woes, a statue of despair, 
to ev'ry breath of wind unmov'd her hair; 
her cheek still red'ning, but its colour [[dead]], 
faded her [[eyes]], and set within her head. 
no more her pliant tongue its motion keeps, 
but stands congeal'd within her frozen lips. 
stagnate, and dull, within her purple veins, 
its current stop'd, the lifeless [[blood]] remains. 
her feet their usual offices refuse, 
her arms, and neck their graceful gestures lose: 
action, and [[life]] from ev'ry part are gone, 
and ev'n her entrails turn to solid stone; 
yet still she weeps, and whirl'd by stormy winds, 
born thro' the air, her native [[country]] finds; 
there fix'd, she stands upon a bleaky hill, 
there yet her marble cheeks eternal tears distil. 

the peasants of lycia transform'd to frogs 

then all, reclaim'd by this [[example]], show'd 
a due regard for each peculiar [[god]]: 
both [[men]], and [[women]] their devoirs express'd, 
and [[great]] latona's awful pow'r confess'd. 
then, tracing instances of older [[time]], 
to suit the [[nature]] of the [[present]] crime, 
thus one begins his tale.- where lycia yields 
a golden harvest from its fertile fields, 
some churlish peasants, in the days of yore, 
provok'd the [[goddess]] to exert her pow'r. 
the thing indeed the meanness of the place 
has made obscure, surprizing as it was; 
but i my [[self]] once happen'd to behold 
this famous lake of which the story's told. 
my [[father]] then, worn out by length of days, 
nor able to sustain the tedious ways, 
me with a guide had sent the plains to roam, 
and drive his well-fed stragling heifers [[home]]. 
here, as we saunter'd thro' the verdant meads, 
we spy'd a lake o'er-grown with trembling reeds, 
whose wavy tops an op'ning scene disclose, 
from which an antique smoaky altar rose. 
i, as my susperstitious guide had done, 
stop'd short, and bless'd my [[self]], and then went on; 
yet i enquir'd to whom the altar stood, 
faunus, the naids, or some native [[god]]? 
no silvan deity, my friend replies, 
enshrin'd within this hallow'd altar lies [[lie]]. 
for this, o [[youth]], to that fam'd [[goddess]] stands, 
whom, at th' imperial juno's rough commands, 
of ev'ry quarter of the [[earth]] bereav'd, 
delos, the floating isle, at length receiv'd. 
who there, in spite of enemies [[enemy]], brought forth, 
beneath an olive's shade, her [[great]] twin-birth. 

hence too she fled the furious stepdame's pow'r, 
and in her arms a double godhead bore; 
and now the borders of [[fair]] lycia gain'd, 
just when the summer solstice parch'd the [[land]]. 
with thirst the [[goddess]] languishing, no more 
her empty'd breast would yield its milky store; 
when, from below, the smiling valley show'd 
a silver lake that in its bottom flow'd: 
a sort of clowns were reaping, near the bank, 
the bending osier, and the bullrush dank; 
the cresse, and water-lilly, fragrant weed, 
whose juicy stalk the liquid fountains feed. 
the [[goddess]] came, and kneeling on the brink, 
stoop'd at the fresh repast, prepar'd to drink. 
then thus, being hinder'd by the rabble [[race]], 
in accents mild expostulates the case. 
water i only ask, and sure 'tis hard 
from nature's [[common]] rights [[right]] to be debar'd: 
this, as the genial sun, and vital air, 
should flow alike to ev'ry creature's share. 
yet still i ask, and as a favour crave, 
that which, a publick bounty, [[nature]] gave. 
nor do i seek my weary limbs to drench; 
only, with one cool draught, my thirst i'd quench. 
now from my throat the usual moisture dries, 
and ev'n my voice in broken accents dies: 
one draught as dear as [[life]] i should esteem, 
and water, now i thirst, would nectar seem. 
oh! let my little babes your [[pity]] move, 
and melt your hearts [[heart]] to charitable [[love]]; 
they (as by [[chance]] they did) extend to you 
their little hands, and my request pursue. 

whom would these soft perswasions not subdue, 
tho' the most rustick, and unmanner'd crew? 
yet they the goddess's request refuse, 
and with rude words reproachfully [[abuse]]: 
nay more, with spiteful feet the villains trod 
o'er the soft bottom of the marshy flood, 
and blacken'd all the lake with clouds of rising mud. 

her thirst by indignation was suppress'd; 
bent on [[revenge]], the [[goddess]] stood confess'd. 
her suppliant hands uplifting to the skies [[sky]], 
for a redress, to heav'n she now applies. 
and, may you [[live]], she passionately cry'd, 
doom'd in that pool for ever to abide. 

the [[goddess]] has her [[wish]]; for now they chuse 
to plunge, and dive among the watry ooze; 
sometimes they shew their head above the brim, 
and on the glassy surface spread to swim; 
often upon the bank their station take, 
then spring, and leap into the cooly lake. 
still, void of shame, they lead a clam'rous [[life]], 
and, croaking, still scold on in endless strife; 
compell'd to [[live]] beneath the liquid stream, 
where still they quarrel, and attempt to skream. 
now, from their bloated throat, their voice puts on 
imperfect murmurs in a hoarser tone; 
their noisy jaws, with bawling now grown wide, 
an ugly sight! extend on either side: 
their motly back, streak'd with a list of green, 
joyn'd to their head, without a neck is seen; 
and, with a belly broad and [[white]], they look 
meer frogs, and still frequent the muddy brook. 

the [[fate]] of marsyas 

scarce had the [[man]] this famous story told, 
of vengeance on the lycians shown of old, 
when strait another pictures to their view 
the satyr's [[fate]], whom angry phoebus slew; 
who, rais'd with high conceit, and puff'd with [[pride]], 
at his own pipe the skilful [[god]] defy'd. 
why do you tear me from my [[self]], he cries? 
ah cruel! must my skin be made the prize? 
this for a silly pipe? he roaring said, 
mean-while the skin from off his limbs was flay'd. 
all bare, and raw, one large continu'd wound, 
with streams of [[blood]] his [[body]] bath'd the ground. 
the blueish veins their trembling pulse disclos'd, 
the stringy nerves lay naked, and expos'd; 
his guts appear'd, distinctly each express'd, 
with ev'ry shining fibre of his breast. 

the fauns, and silvans, with the nymphs [[nymph]] that rove 
among the satyrs in the shady grove; 
olympus, known of old, and ev'ry swain 
that fed, or flock, or herd upon the plain, 
bewail'd the loss; and with their tears that flow'd, 
a kindly moisture on the [[earth]] bestow'd; 
that soon, conjoyn'd, and in a [[body]] rang'd, 
sprung from the ground, to limpid water chang'd; 
which, down thro' phrygia's rocks, a mighty stream, 
comes tumbling to the sea, and marsya is its name. 

the story of pelops 

from these relations strait the [[people]] turn 
to [[present]] truths [[truth]], and lost amphion mourn: 
the [[mother]] most was blam'd, yet some relate 
that pelops pity'd, and bewail'd her [[fate]], 
and stript his cloaths, and laid his shoulder bare, 
and made the iv'ry miracle appear. 
this shoulder, from the first, was form'd of flesh, 
as lively as the other, and as fresh; 
but, when the [[youth]] was by his [[father]] slain, 
the gods restor'd his mangled limbs again; 
only that place which joins the neck and arm, 
the rest untouch'd, was found to suffer harm: 
the loss of which an iv'ry piece sustain'd; 
and thus the [[youth]] his limbs, and [[life]] regain'd. 

the story of tereus, procne, and philomela 

to thebes the neighb'ring princes [[prince]] all repair, 
and with condolance the misfortune share. 
each bord'ring [[state]] in solemn form address'd, 
and each betimes a friendly [[grief]] express'd. 
argos, with sparta's, and mycenae's towns, 
and calydon, yet [[free]] from fierce diana's frowns. 
corinth for finest brass well fam'd of old, 
orthomenos for [[men]] of [[courage]] bold: 
cleonae lying in the lowly dale, 
and [[rich]] messene with its fertile vale: 
pylos, for nestor's [[city]] after fam'd, 
and troezen, not as yet from pittheus nam'd. 
and those [[fair]] cities [[city]], which are hem'd around 
by double seas within the isthmian ground; 
and those, which farther from the sea-coast stand, 
lodg'd in the bosom of the spacious [[land]]. 

who can [[believe]] it? [[athens]] was the [[last]]: 
tho' for politeness fam'd for ages [[age]] [[past]]. 
for a strait siege, which then their walls enclos'd, 
such acts of [[kind]] [[humanity]] oppos'd: 
and thick with ships, from [[foreign]] nations bound, 
sea-ward their [[city]] lay invested round. 

these, with auxiliar forces [[force]] [[led]] from far, 
tereus of thrace, brave, and inur'd to [[war]], 
had quite defeated, and obtain'd a name, 
the warrior's due, among the sons [[son]] of fame. 
this, with his [[wealth]], and pow'r, and ancient line, 
from [[mars]] deriv'd, pandions's thoughts [[thought]] incline 
his [[daughter]] procne with the [[prince]] to joyn. 

nor hymen, nor the graces here preside, 
nor juno to befriend the blooming bride; 
but fiends with fun'ral brands the process [[led]], 
and furies waited at the genial bed: 
and all night long the scrieching owl aloof, 
with baleful notes, sate brooding o'er the roof. 
with such ill omens was the match begun, 
that made them parents of a hopeful [[son]]. 
now thrace congratulates their seeming joy, 
and they, in thankful rites, their minds [[mind]] employ. 
if the [[fair]] queen's espousals pleas'd before, 
itys, the new-born [[prince]], now pleases more; 
and each bright day, the birth, and bridal feast, 
were kept with hallow'd pomp above the rest. 
so far true [[happiness]] may lye conceal'd, 
when, by false lights [[light]], we fancy 'tis reveal'd! 

now, since their nuptials, had the golden sun 
five courses round his ample zodiac run; 
when gentle procne thus her [[lord]] address'd, 
and spoke the secret wishes [[wish]] of her breast: 
if i, she said, have ever favour found, 
let my petition with [[success]] be crown'd: 
let me at [[athens]] my dear sister see, 
or let her come to thrace, and visit me. 
and, lest my [[father]] should her absence mourn, 
promise that she shall make a quick return. 
with thanks i'd own the obligation due 
only, o tereus, to the gods, and you. 

now, ply'd with oar, and sail at his command, 
the nimble gallies reach'd th' athenian [[land]], 
and anchor'd in the fam'd piraean bay, 
while tereus to the palace takes his way; 
the [[king]] salutes, and ceremonies [[ceremony]] [[past]], 
begins the fatal embassy at [[last]]; 
the [[occasion]] of his [[voyage]] he declares, 
and, with his own, his wife's request prefers: 
asks leave that, only for a little space, 
their lovely sister might embark for thrace. 

thus while he spoke, appear'd the [[royal]] maid, 
bright philomela, splendidly array'd; 
but most attractive in her charming face, 
and comely [[person]], turn'd with ev'ry grace: 
like those [[fair]] nymphs [[nymph]], that are describ'd to rove 
across the glades, and op'nings of the grove; 
only that these are dress'd for silvan sports [[sport]], 
and less become the finery of courts. 

tereus beheld the virgin, and admir'd, 
and with the coals of burning [[lust]] was fir'd: 
like crackling stubble, or the summer hay, 
when forked lightnings o'er the meadows play. 
such charms in any breast might kindle [[love]], 
but him the heats of inbred lewdness move; 
to which, tho' thrace is naturally prone, 
yet his is still superior, and his own. 
strait her attendants he designs to buy, 
and with large bribes her governess would try: 
herself with ample gifts resolves to bend, 
and his whole [[kingdom]] in th' attempt expend: 
or, snatch'd away by [[force]] of arms, to bear, 
and justify the rape with open [[war]]. 
the boundless passion boils within his breast, 
and his projecting [[soul]] admits no rest. 

and now, impatient of the least delay, 
by pleading procne's cause, he speeds his way: 
the eloquence of [[love]] his tongue inspires, 
and, in his wife's, he speaks his own desires [[desire]]; 
hence all his importunities arise, 
and tears unmanly trickle from his [[eyes]]. 

ye gods! what thick involving darkness blinds 
the stupid faculties of mortal minds! 
tereus the credit of good-nature gains 
from these his crimes; so well the villain feigns. 
and, unsuspecting of his base designs, 
in the request [[fair]] philomela joyns; 
her snowy arms her aged sire embrace, 
and clasp his neck with an endearing grace: 
only to see her sister she entreats, 
a seeming blessing, which a curse compleats. 
tereus surveys her with a luscious eye, 
and in his [[mind]] forestalls the blissful joy: 
her circling arms a scene of [[lust]] inspire, 
and ev'ry kiss foments the raging [[fire]]. 
fondly he wishes [[wish]] for the father's place, 
to [[feel]], and to return the warm embrace; 
since not the nearest ties of filial [[blood]] 
would damp his flame, and [[force]] him to be [[good]]. 

at length, for both their sakes, the [[king]] agrees; 
and philomela, on her bended knees, 
thanks him for what her fancy calls [[success]], 
when cruel [[fate]] intends her nothing less. 

now phoebus, hastning to ambrosial rest, 
his fiery steeds drove sloping down the west: 
the sculptur'd gold with sparkling wines was fill'd, 
and, with [[rich]] meats, each chearful table smil'd. 
plenty, and mirth the [[royal]] banquet close, 
then all retire to sleep, and sweet repose. 
but the lewd monarch, tho' withdrawn apart, 
still feels [[feel]] love's poison rankling in his [[heart]]: 
her face [[divine]] is stamp'd within his breast, 
fancy imagines, and improves the rest: 
and thus, kept waking by intense [[desire]], 
he nourishes his own prevailing [[fire]]. 

next day the [[good]] old [[king]] for tereus sends, 
and to his charge the virgin recommends; 
his hand with tears th' indulgent [[father]] press'd, 
then spoke, and thus with tenderness address'd. 

since the [[kind]] instances of pious [[love]], 
do all pretence of obstacle remove; 
since procne's, and her own, with your request, 
o'er-rule the fears [[fear]] of a paternal breast; 
with you, dear [[son]], my [[daughter]] i entrust, 
and by the gods adjure you to be just; 
by [[truth]], and ev'ry consanguineal tye, 
to watch, and guard her with a father's eye. 
and, since the least delay will tedious prove, 
in keeping from my sight the child i [[love]], 
with speed return her, kindly to asswage 
the tedious troubles of my lingring [[age]]. 
and you, my philomel, let it suffice, 
to [[know]] your sister's banish'd from my [[eyes]]; 
if any sense of [[duty]] sways your [[mind]], 
let me from you the shortest absence find. 
he wept; then kiss'd his child; and while he speaks, 
the tears fall gently down his aged cheeks. 
next, as a pledge of fealty, he demands, 
and, with a solemn charge, conjoyns their hands; 
then to his [[daughter]], and his grandson sends, 
and by their mouth a blessing recommends; 
while, in a voice with dire forebodings broke, 
sobbing, and faint, the [[last]] farewel was spoke. 

now philomela, scarce receiv'd on board, 
and in the [[royal]] gilded bark secur'd, 
beheld the dashes of the bending oar, 
the ruffled sea, and the receding shore; 
when strait (his joy impatient of disguise) 
we've gain'd our point, the rough barbarian cries; 
now i possess the dear, the blissful hour, 
and ev'ry [[wish]] subjected to my pow'r. 
transports of [[lust]] his vicious thoughts [[thought]] employ, 
and he forbears, with [[pain]], th' expected joy. 
his gloting [[eyes]] incessantly survey'd 
the virgin beauties [[beauty]] of the lovely maid: 
as when the bold rapacious bird of jove, 
with crooked talons stooping from above, 
has snatcht, and carry'd to his lofty nest 
a captive hare, with cruel gripes opprest; 
secure, with fix'd, and unrelenting [[eyes]], 
he sits, and views the helpless, trembling prize. 

their vessels now had made th' intended [[land]], 
and all with joy descend upon the strand; 
when the false [[tyrant]] seiz'd the princely maid, 
and to a lodge in distant woods convey'd; 
pale, sinking, and distress'd with [[jealous]] fears [[fear]], 
and asking for her sister all in tears. 
the letcher, for enjoyment fully bent, 
no longer now conceal'd his base intent; 
but with rude haste the bloomy girl deflow'r'd, 
tender, defenceless, and with ease o'erpower'd. 
her piercing accents to her sire [[complain]], 
and to her absent sister, but in [[vain]]: 
in [[vain]] she importunes, with doleful cries, 
each unattentive godhead of the skies [[sky]]. 
she pants and trembles, like the bleating prey, 
from some close-hunted wolf just snatch'd away; 
that still, with fearful [[horror]], looks around, 
and on its flank regards the bleeding wound. 
or, as the tim'rous dove, the danger o'er, 
beholds her shining plumes besmear'd with gore, 
and, tho' deliver'd from the faulcon's claw, 
yet shivers, and retains a secret awe. 

but when her [[mind]] a calm reflection shar'd, 
and all her scatter'd spirits were repair'd: 
torn, and disorder'd while her tresses hung, 
her livid hands, like one that mourn'd, she wrung; 
then thus, with [[grief]] o'erwhelm'd her languid [[eyes]], 
savage, inhumane, cruel wretch! she cries; 
whom not a parent's strict commands could move, 
tho' charg'd, and utter'd with the tears of [[love]]; 
nor virgin innocence, nor all that's due 
to the [[strong]] contract of the nuptial vow: 
virtue, by this, in wild confusion's laid, 
and i compell'd to [[wrong]] my sister's bed; 
whilst you, regardless of your [[marriage]] oath, 
with stains of incest have defil'd us both. 
tho' i deserv'd some [[punishment]] to find, 
this was, ye gods! too cruel, and unkind. 
yet, villain, to compleat your horrid guilt, 
stab here, and let my tainted [[blood]] be spilt. 
oh happy! had it come, before i knew 
the curs'd embrace of vile perfidious you; 
then my pale ghost, pure from incestuous [[love]], 
had wander'd spotless thro' th' elysian grove. 
but, if the gods above have pow'r to [[know]], 
and [[judge]] those actions that are done below; 
unless the dreaded thunders of the [[sky]], 
like me, subdu'd, and violated lye; 
still my [[revenge]] shall take its proper [[time]], 
and suit the baseness of your hellish crime. 
my [[self]], abandon'd, and devoid of shame, 
thro' the wide [[world]] your actions will proclaim; 
or tho' i'm prison'd in this lonely den, 
obscur'd, and bury'd from the sight of [[men]], 
my mournful voice the pitying rocks shall move, 
and my complainings eccho thro' the grove. 
hear me, o heav'n! and, if a [[god]] be there, 
let him regard me, and accept my pray'r. 

struck with these words, the tyrant's guilty breast 
with [[fear]], and anger, was, by turns, possest; 
now, with remorse his [[conscience]] deeply stung, 
he drew the faulchion that beside her hung, 
and first her tender arms behind her bound, 
then drag'd her by the hair along the ground. 
the princess willingly her throat reclin'd, 
and view'd the steel with a contented [[mind]]; 
but soon her tongue the girding pinchers strain, 
with anguish, soon she feels [[feel]] the piercing [[pain]]: 
oh father! father! would fain have spoke, 
but the sharp torture her intention broke; 
in [[vain]] she tries, for now the blade has cut 
her tongue sheer off, close to the trembling root. 
the mangled part still quiver'd on the ground, 
murmuring with a faint imperfect sound: 
and, as a serpent writhes his wounded train, 
uneasy, panting, and possess'd with [[pain]]; 
the piece, while [[life]] remain'd, still trembled fast, 
and to its mistress pointed to the [[last]]. 

yet, after this so damn'd, and black a deed, 
fame (which i scarce can credit) has agreed, 
that on her rifled charms, still void of shame, 
he frequently indulg'd his lustful flame, 
at [[last]] he ventures to his procne's sight, 
loaded with guilt, and cloy'd with long delight; 
there, with feign'd [[grief]], and false, dissembled sighs, 
begins a formal narrative of lies [[lie]]; 
her sister's [[death]] he artfully declares, 
then weeps, and raises credit from his tears. 
her vest, with flow'rs of gold embroider'd o'er, 
with [[grief]] distress'd, the mournful matron tore, 
and a beseeming suit of gloomy sable wore. 
with cost, an honorary tomb she rais'd, 
and thus th' imaginary ghost appeas'd. 
deluded queen! the [[fate]] of her you [[love]], 
nor [[grief]], nor [[pity]], but [[revenge]] should move. 

thro' the twelve signs had pass'd the circling sun, 
and round the compass of the zodiac run; 
what must unhappy philomela do, 
for ever [[subject]] to her keeper's view? 
huge walls of massy stone the lodge surround, 
from her own mouth no way of speaking's found. 
but all our wants by wit may be supply'd, 
and art [[arts]] makes up, what [[fortune]] has deny'd: 
with [[skill]] exact a phrygian web she strung, 
fix'd to a loom that in her chamber hung, 
where in-wrought letters, upon [[white]] display'd, 
in purple notes, her wretched case betray'd: 
the piece, when finish'd, secretly she gave 
into the charge of one [[poor]] menial [[slave]]; 
and then, with gestures, made him [[understand]], 
it must be safe convey'd to procne's hand. 
the [[slave]], with speed, the queen's apartment sought, 
and render'd up his charge, unknowing what he brought. 
but when the cyphers, figur'd in each fold, 
her sister's melancholy story told 
(strange that she could!) with [[silence]], she survey'd 
the tragick piece, and without weeping [[read]]: 
in such tumultuous haste her [[passions]] sprung, 
they choak'd her voice, and quite disarm'd her tongue. 
no room for female tears; the furies rise, 
darting vindictive glances from her [[eyes]]; 
and, stung with rage, she bounds from place to place, 
while stern [[revenge]] sits low'ring in her face. 

now the triennial celebration came, 
observ'd to bacchus by each thracian dame; 
when, in the privacies of night retir'd, 
they act his rites, with [[sacred]] rapture fir'd: 
by night, the tinkling cymbals ring around, 
while the shrill notes from rhodope resound; 
by night, the queen, disguis'd, forsakes the court, 
to mingle in the festival resort. 
leaves of the curling vine her temples shade, 
and, with a circling wreath, adorn her head: 
adown her back the stag's rough spoils appear, 
light on her shoulder leans a cornel spear. 

thus, in the fury of the [[god]] conceal'd, 
procne her own mad headstrong passion veil'd; 
now, with her gang, to the thick wood she flies, 
and with [[religious]] yellings fills the skies [[sky]]; 
the fatal lodge, as 'twere by [[chance]], she seeks, 
and, thro' the bolted doors, an entrance breaks; 
from thence, her sister snatching by the hand, 
mask'd like the ranting bacchanalian band, 
within the limits of the court she drew, 
shading, with ivy green, her outward hue. 
but philomela, conscious of the place, 
felt new reviving pangs of her disgrace; 
a shiv'ring cold prevail'd in ev'ry part, 
and the chill'd [[blood]] ran trembling to her [[heart]]. 

soon as the queen a fit retirement found, 
stript of the garlands that her temples crown'd, 
she strait unveil'd her blushing sister's face, 
and fondly clasp'd her with a close embrace: 
but, in confusion lost, th' unhappy maid, 
with shame dejected, hung her drooping head, 
as guilty of a crime that stain'd her sister's bed. 
that [[speech]], that should her injur'd [[virtue]] clear, 
and make her spotless innocence appear, 
is now no more; only her hands, and [[eyes]] 
appeal, in signals, to the conscious skies [[sky]]. 
in procne's breast the rising [[passions]] boil, 
and burst in anger with a mad recoil; 
her sister's ill-tim'd [[grief]], with scorn, she blames, 
then, in these furious words her rage proclaims. 

tears, unavailing, but defer our [[time]], 
the stabbing [[sword]] must expiate the crime; 
or worse, if wit, on bloody vengeance bent, 
a weapon more tormenting can invent. 
o sister! i've prepar'd my stubborn [[heart]], 
to act some hellish, and unheard-of part; 
either the palace to surround with [[fire]], 
and see the villain in the flames expire; 
or, with a knife, dig out his cursed [[eyes]], 
or, his false tongue with racking engines seize; 
or, cut away the part that injur'd you, 
and, thro' a thousand wounds, his guilty [[soul]] pursue. 
tortures enough my passion has design'd, 
but the variety distracts my [[mind]]. 

a-while, thus wav'ring, stood the furious dame, 
when itys fondling to his [[mother]] came; 
from him the cruel fatal hint she took, 
she view'd him with a stern remorseless look: 
ah! but too like thy wicked sire, she said, 
forming the direful [[purpose]] in her head. 
at this a sullen [[grief]] her voice supprest, 
while silent [[passions]] struggle in her breast. 

now, at her lap arriv'd, the flatt'ring boy 
salutes his parent with a smiling joy: 
about her neck his little arms are thrown, 
and he accosts her in a pratling tone. 
then her tempestuous anger was allay'd, 
and in its full [[career]] her vengeance stay'd; 
while tender thoughts [[thought]], in spite of passion, rise, 
and melting tears disarm her threat'ning [[eyes]]. 
but when she found the mother's easy [[heart]], 
too fondly swerving from th' intended part; 
her injur'd sister's face again she view'd: 
and, as by turns surveying both she stood, 
while this fond boy (she said) can thus express 
the moving accents of his fond address; 
why stands my sister of her tongue bereft, 
forlorn, and [[sad]], in speechless [[silence]] left? 
o procne, see the [[fortune]] of your house! 
such is your [[fate]], when match'd to such a spouse! 
conjugal [[duty]], if observ'd to him, 
would [[change]] from [[virtue]], and become a crime; 
for all [[respect]] to tereus must debase 
the [[noble]] [[blood]] of [[great]] pandion's [[race]]. 

strait at these words, with big resentment fill'd, 
furious her look, she flew, and seiz'd her child; 
like a fell tigress of the savage [[kind]], 
that drags the tender suckling of the hind 
thro' india's gloomy groves, where ganges laves 
the shady scene, and rouls his streamy waves. 

now to a close apartment they were come, 
far off retir'd within the spacious dome; 
when procne, on revengeful mischief bent, 
home to his [[heart]] a piercing ponyard sent. 
itys, with rueful cries, but all too late, 
holds out his hands, and deprecates his [[fate]]; 
still at his mother's neck he fondly aims, 
and strives to melt her with endearing names; 
yet still the cruel [[mother]] perseveres, 
nor with concern his bitter anguish hears. 
this might suffice; but philomela too 
across his throat a shining curtlass drew. 
then both, with knives, dissect each quiv'ring part, 
and carve the butcher'd limbs with cruel art [[arts]]; 
which, whelm'd in boiling cauldrons o'er the [[fire]], 
or turn'd on spits, in steamy smoak aspire: 
while the long entries, with their slipp'ry floor, 
run down in purple streams of clotted gore. 

ask'd by his [[wife]] to this inhuman feast, 
tereus unknowingly is made a guest: 
whilst she her plot the [[better]] to [[disguise]], 
styles it some unknown mystick [[sacrifice]]; 
and such the [[nature]] of the hallow'd rite, 
the [[wife]] her husband only could invite, 
the slaves [[slave]] must all withdraw, and be debarr'd the sight.

tereus, upon a [[throne]] of antique [[state]], 
loftily rais'd, before the banquet sate; 
and glutton like, luxuriously pleas'd, 
with his own flesh his hungry maw appeas'd. 
nay, such a blindness o'er his senses falls, 
that he for itys to the table calls. 
when procne, now impatient to disclose 
the joy that from her full [[revenge]] arose, 
cries out, in transports of a cruel [[mind]], 
within your [[self]] your itys you may find. 
still, at this puzzling [[answer]], with surprise, 
around the room he sends his [[curious]] [[eyes]]; 
and, as he still inquir'd, and call'd aloud, 
fierce philomela, all besmear'd with [[blood]], 
her hands with murder stain'd, her spreading hair 
hanging dishevel'd with a ghastly air, 
stept forth, and flung full in the tyrant's face 
the head of itys, goary as it was: 
nor ever so much to use her tongue, 
and with a just reproach to vindicate her [[wrong]]. 

the thracian monarch from the table flings, 
while with his cries the vaulted parlour rings; 
his imprecations eccho down to hell, 
and rouze the snaky furies from their stygian cell. 
one while he labours [[labour]] to disgorge his breast, 
and [[free]] his stomach from the cursed feast; 
then, weeping o'er his lamentable doom, 
he styles himself his son's sepulchral tomb. 
now, with drawn sabre, and impetuous speed, 
in close pursuit he drives pandion's breed; 
whose nimble feet spring with so swift a [[force]] 
across the fields, they seem to wing their course. 
and now, on real wings themselves they raise, 
and steer their airy flight by diff'rent ways; 
one to the woodland's shady covert hies, 
around the smoaky roof the other flies; 
whose feathers yet the marks of murder stain, 
where stampt upon her breast, the crimson spots remain. 
tereus, through [[grief]], and haste to be reveng'd, 
shares the like [[fate]], and to a bird is chang'd: 
fix'd on his head, the crested plumes appear, 
long is his beak, and sharpen'd like a spear; 
thus arm'd, his looks his inward [[mind]] display, 
and, to a lapwing turn'd, he fans his way. 
exceeding trouble, for his children's [[fate]], 
shorten'd pandion's days, and chang'd his date; 
down to the shades below, with [[sorrow]] spent, 
an earlier, unexpected ghost he went. 

boreas in [[love]] 

erechtheus next th' athenian sceptre sway'd, 
whose [[rule]] the [[state]] with joynt [[consent]] obey'd; 
so mix'd his [[justice]] with his valour flow'd, 
his reign one scene of princely goodness shew'd. 
four hopeful youths [[youth]], as many females bright, 
sprung from his loyns, and sooth'd him with delight. 

two of these sisters, of a lovelier air, 
excell'd the rest, tho' all the rest were [[fair]]. 
procris, to cephalus in wedlock ty'd, 
bless'd the [[young]] silvan with a blooming bride: 
for orithyia boreas suffer'd [[pain]], 
for the coy maid sued long, but sued in [[vain]]; 
tereus his neighbour, and his thracian [[blood]], 
against the match a main objection stood; 
which made his vows, and all his suppliant [[love]], 
empty as air and ineffectual prove. 

but when he found his soothing flatt'ries fail, 
nor saw his soft addresses cou'd avail; 
blust'ring with ire, he quickly has recourse 
to rougher [[arts]], and his own native [[force]]. 
'tis well, he said; such usage is my due, 
when thus disguis'd by [[foreign]] ways i sue; 
when my stern airs, and fierceness i disclaim, 
and sigh for [[love]], ridiculously tame; 
when soft addresses foolishly i try, 
nor my own stronger remedies apply. 
by [[force]] and [[violence]] i chiefly [[live]], 
by them the lowring stormy tempests drive; 
in foaming billows raise the hoary deep, 
writhe knotted oaks, and sandy desarts sweep; 
congeal the falling flakes of fleecy snow, 
and bruise, with ratling hall, the plains below. 
i, and my brother-winds, when joyn'd above, 
thro' the waste champian of the skies [[sky]] we rove, 
with such a boist'rous full [[career]] engage, 
that heav'n's whole concave thunders at our rage. 
while, struck from nitrous clouds, fierce lightnings play,

dart thro' the storm, and gild the gloomy day. 
or when, in subterraneous caverns pent, 
my breath, against the hollow [[earth]], is bent, 
the quaking [[world]] above, and ghosts below, 
my mighty pow'r, by dear [[experience]], [[know]], 
tremble with [[fear]], and dread the fatal blow. 
this is the only cure to be apply'd, 
thus to erechtheus i should be ally'd; 
and thus the scornful virgin should be woo'd, 
not by intreaty, but by [[force]] subdu'd. 

boreas, in passion, spoke these huffing things, 
and, as he spoke, he shook his dreadful wings; 
at which, afar the shiv'ring sea was fan'd, 
and the wide surface of the distant [[land]]: 
his dusty mantle o'er the hills he drew, 
and swept the lowly vallies, as he flew; 
then, with his yellow wings, embrac'd the maid, 
and, wrapt in dusky clouds, far off convey'd. 
the sparkling blaze of love's prevailing [[fire]] 
shone brighter as he flew, and flam'd the higher. 
and now the [[god]], possess'd of his delight, 
to northern thrace pursu'd his airy flight, 
where the [[young]] ravish'd [[nymph]] became his bride, 
and soon the luscious sweets of wedlock try'd. 

two lovely twins, th' effect of this embrace, 
crown their soft labours [[labour]], and their nuptials grace; 
who, like their [[mother]], beautiful, and [[fair]], 
their father's [[strength]], and feather'd pinions share: 
yet these, at first, were wanting, as 'tis said, 
and after, as they grew, their shoulders spread. 
zethes and calais, the pretty twins, 
remain'd unfledg'd, while smooth their beardless chins; 
but when, in [[time]], the budding silver down 
shaded their face, and on their cheeks was grown, 
two sprouting wings upon their shoulders sprung, 
like those in birds, that veil the callow [[young]]. 
then as their [[age]] advanc'd, and they began 
from greener [[youth]] to ripen into [[man]], 
with jason's argonauts they cross'd the seas, 
embark'd in quest of the fam'd golden fleece; 
there, with the rest, the first frail vessel try'd, 
and boldly ventur'd on the swelling tide. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book the seventh

the story of medea and jason 

the argonauts now stemm'd the foaming tide, 
and to arcadia's shore their course apply'd; 
where sightless phineus spent his [[age]] in [[grief]], 
but boreas' sons [[son]] engage in his relief; 
and those unwelcome guests, the odious [[race]] 
of harpyes, from the monarch's table chase. 
with jason then they greater toils sustain, 
and phasis' slimy banks at [[last]] they gain, 
here boldly they demand the golden prize 
of scythia's [[king]], who sternly thus replies: 
that mighty labours [[labour]] they must first o'ercome, 
or sail their argo thence unfreighted [[home]]. 
meanwhile medea, seiz'd with fierce [[desire]], 
by [[reason]] strives to quench the raging [[fire]]; 
but strives in vain!- some [[god]] (she said) withstands, 
and reason's baffl'd council countermands. 
what unseen pow'r does this disorder move? 
'tis [[love]],- at least 'tis like, what [[men]] call [[love]]. 
else wherefore shou'd the king's commands appear 
to me too hard?- but so indeed they are. 
why shou'd i for a stranger [[fear]], lest he 
shou'd perish, whom i did but lately see? 
his [[death]], or safety, what are they to me? 
wretch, from thy virgin-breast this flame expel, 
and soon- oh cou'd i, all wou'd then be well! 
but [[love]], resistless [[love]], my [[soul]] invades; 
discretion this, affection that perswades. 
i see the [[right]], and i approve it too, 
condemn the wrong- and yet the [[wrong]] pursue. 
why, [[royal]] maid, shou'dst thou [[desire]] to wed 
a wanderer, and court a [[foreign]] bed? 
thy native [[land]], tho' barb'rous, can [[present]] 
a bridegroom worth a [[royal]] bride's content: 
and whether this advent'rer lives [[life]], or dies, 
in [[fate]], and fortune's fickle [[pleasure]] lies [[lie]]. 
yet may be live! for to the pow'rs above, 
a virgin, [[led]] by no impulse of [[love]], 
so just a suit may, for the guiltless, move. 
whom wou'd not jason's valour, [[youth]] and [[blood]] 
invite? or cou'd these merits [[merit]] be withstood, 
at least his charming [[person]] must encline 
the hardest heart- i'm sure 'tis so with mine! 
yet, if i [[help]] him not, the flaming breath 
of bulls, and earth-born foes, must be his [[death]]. 
or, should he through these dangers [[force]] his way, 
at [[last]] he must be made the dragon's prey. 
if no remorse for such distress i [[feel]], 
i am a tigress, and my breast is steel. 
why do i scruple then to see him slain, 
and with the tragick scene my [[eyes]] prophane? 
my magick's art [[arts]] employ, not to asswage 
the salvages, but to enflame their rage? 
his earth-born foes to fiercer fury move, 
and accessary to his murder prove? 
the gods forbid- but pray'rs are idle breath, 
when action only can prevent his [[death]]. 
shall i betray my [[father]], and the [[state]], 
to intercept a rambling hero's [[fate]]; 
who may sail off next hour, and sav'd from harms 
by my assistance, bless another's arms? 
whilst i, not only of my hopes [[hope]] bereft, 
but to unpity'd [[punishment]] am left. 
if he is false, let the ingrateful bleed! 
but no such symptom in his looks i [[read]]. 
nature wou'd ne'er have lavish'd so much grace 
upon his [[person]], if his [[soul]] were base. 
besides, he first shall plight his [[faith]], and swear 
by all the gods; what therefore can'st thou [[fear]]? 
medea haste, from danger set him [[free]], 
jason shall thy eternal debtor be. 
and thou, his queen, with sov'raign [[state]] enstall'd, 
by graecian dames the [[kind]] preserver call'd. 
hence idle dreams [[dream]], by love-sick fancy bred! 
wilt thou, medea, by [[vain]] wishes [[wish]] [[led]], 
to sister, [[brother]], [[father]] bid adieu? 
forsake thy country's gods, and [[country]] too? 
my father's harsh, my [[brother]] but a child, 
my sister rivals me, my country's wild; 
and for its gods, the [[greatest]] of 'em all 
inspires my breast, and i obey his call. 
that [[great]] endearments i forsake, is true, 
but greater far the hopes [[hope]] that i pursue: 
the [[pride]] of having sav'd the youths [[youth]] of greece 
(each [[life]] more precious than our golden fleece); 
a nobler soil by me shall be possest, 
i shall see towns with [[arts]] and manners blest; 
and, what i prize above the [[world]] beside, 
enjoy my jason- and when once his bride, 
be more than mortal, and to gods ally'd. 
they talk of hazards i must first sustain, 
of floating islands justling in the main; 
our tender barque expos'd to dreadful shocks 
of fierce charybdis' gulf, and scylla's rocks, 
where breaking waves in whirling eddies rowl, 
and rav'nous dogs that in deep caverns howl: 
amidst these terrors, while i lye possest 
of him i [[love]], and lean on jason's breast, 
in tempests unconcern'd i will appear, 
or, only for my husband's safety [[fear]]. 
didst thou say husband?- canst thou so [[deceive]] 
thy [[self]], fond maid, and thy own [[cheat]] [[believe]]? 
in [[vain]] thou striv'st to varnish o'er thy shame, 
and grace thy guilt with wedlock's [[sacred]] name. 
pull off the coz'ning masque, and oh! in [[time]] 
discover and avoid the fatal crime. 
she ceas'd- the graces now, with [[kind]] surprize, 
and virtue's lovely train, before her [[eyes]] 
present themselves, and vanquish'd cupid flies. 

she then retires to hecate's shrine, that stood 
far in the covert of a shady wood: 
she finds the fury of her flames asswag'd, 
but, seeing jason there, again they rag'd. 
blushes, and paleness did by turns invade 
her tender cheeks, and secret [[grief]] betray'd. 
as [[fire]], that sleeping under ashes lyes, 
fresh-blown, and rous'd, does up in blazes rise, 
so flam'd the virgin's breast- 
new kindled by her lover's sparkling [[eyes]]. 
for [[chance]], that day, had with uncommon grace 
adorn'd the lovely [[youth]], and through his face 
display'd an air so pleasing as might charm 
a [[goddess]], and a vestal's bosom warm. 
her ravish'd [[eyes]] survey him o'er and o'er, 
as some [[gay]] wonder never seen before; 
transported to the skies [[sky]] she seems to be, 
and thinks [[think]] she gazes on a deity. 
but when he spoke, and prest her trembling hand, 
and did with tender words her aid demand, 
with vows, and oaths to make her soon his bride, 
she wept a flood of tears, and thus reply'd: 
i see my error, yet to ruin move, 
nor owe my [[fate]] to ignorance, but [[love]]: 
your [[life]] i'll guard, and only crave of you 
to swear once more- and to your oath be true. 
he swears by hecate he would all fulfil, 
and by her grandfather's prophetick [[skill]], 
by ev'ry thing that doubting [[love]] cou'd press, 
his [[present]] danger, and desir'd [[success]]. 
she credits him, and kindly does [[produce]] 
enchanted herbs, and teaches [[teach]] him their use: 
their mystick names, and virtues [[virtue]] he admires, 
and with his booty joyfully retires. 

the dragon's teeth transform'd to [[men]] 

impatient for the wonders of the day, 
aurora drives the loyt'ring stars away. 
now mars's mount the pressing [[people]] fill, 
the crowd below, the nobles [[noble]] [[crown]] the hill; 
the [[king]] himself high-thron'd above the rest, 
with iv'ry scepter, and in purple drest. 

forthwith the brass-hoof'd bulls are set at large, 
whose furious nostrils sulph'rous flame discharge: 
the blasted herbage by their breath expires; 
as forges rumble with excessive fires [[fire]], 
and furnaces with fiercer fury glow, 
when water on the panting mass ye throw; 
with such a noise, from their convulsive breast, 
thro' bellowing throats, the struggling vapour prest. 

yet jason marches up without concern, 
while on th' advent'rous [[youth]] the monsters turn 
their glaring [[eyes]], and, eager to engage, 
brandish their steel-tipt horns in threatning rage: 
with brazen hoofs they beat the ground, and choak 
the ambient air with clouds of dust and smoak: 
each gazing graecian for his champion shakes, 
while bold advances he securely makes 
thro' sindging blasts; such wonders magick art [[arts]] 
can [[work]], when [[love]] conspires, and plays his part. 
the passive savages like statues stand, 
while he their dew-laps stroaks with soothing hand; 
to unknown yokes their brawny necks they yield, 
and, like tame oxen, plow the wond'ring field. 
the colchians stare; the graecians shout, and raise 
their champion's [[courage]] with inspiring [[praise]]. 

embolden'd now, on fresh attempts he goes, 
with serpent's teeth the fertile furrows sows; 
the glebe, fermenting with inchanted juice, 
makes the snake's teeth a [[human]] crop [[produce]]. 
for as an infant, pris'ner to the womb, 
contented sleeps, 'till to [[perfection]] come, 
then does the cell's obscure confinement scorn, 
he tosses, throbs, and presses to be born; 
so from the lab'ring [[earth]] no [[single]] birth, 
but a whole troop of lusty youths [[youth]] rush forth; 
and, what's more [[strange]], with martial fury warm'd, 
and for encounter all compleatly arm'd; 
in rank and file, as they were sow'd, they stand, 
impatient for the signal of command. 
no foe but the aemonian [[youth]] appears; 
at him they level their steel-pointed spears; 
his frighted [[friends]], who triumph'd, just before, 
with peals of sighs his desp'rate case deplore: 
and where such hardy warriors are afraid, 
what must the tender, and enamour'd maid? 
her spirits sink, the [[blood]] her cheek forsook; 
she fears [[fear]], who for his safety undertook: 
she knew the vertue of the spells she gave, 
she knew the [[force]], and knew her lover brave; 
but what's a [[single]] champion to an host? 
yet scorning thus to see him tamely lost, 
her [[strong]] reserve of secret [[arts]] she brings, 
and [[last]], her never-failing [[song]] she sings. 
wonders ensue; among his gazing foes 
the massy fragment of a rock he throws; 
this charm in civil [[war]] engag'd 'em all; 
by mutual wounds those earth-born brothers [[brother]] fall. 

the greeks [[greek]], transported with the [[strange]] [[success]], 
leap from their seats the conqu'ror to caress; 
commend, and kiss, and clasp him in their arms: 
so would the [[kind]] contriver of the charms; 
but her, who [[felt]] the tenderest concern, 
honour condemns in secret flames to burn; 
committed to a double guard of fame, 
aw'd by a virgin's, and a princess' name. 
but thoughts [[thought]] are [[free]], and fancy unconfin'd, 
she kisses, courts, and hugs him in her [[mind]]; 
to fav'ring pow'rs her silent thanks she gives, 
by whose indulgence her lov'd hero lives [[life]]. 

one [[labour]] more remains, and, tho' the [[last]], 
in danger far surmounting all the [[past]]; 
that enterprize by fates [[fate]] in store was kept, 
to make the dragon sleep that never slept, 
whose crest shoots dreadful lustre; from his jaws 
a tripple tire of forked stings he draws, 
with fangs, and wings of a prodigious size: 
such was the guardian of the golden prize. 
yet him, besprinkled with lethaean dew, 
the [[fair]] inchantress into slumber threw; 
and then, to fix him, thrice she did repeat 
the rhyme, that makes the raging winds retreat, 
in stormy seas can halcyon seasons make, 
turn rapid streams into a standing lake; 
while the soft guest his drowzy eye-lids seals, 
th' ungarded golden fleece the stranger steals; 
proud to possess the purchase of his toil, 
proud of his [[royal]] bride, the richer spoil; 
to sea both prize, and patroness he bore, 
and lands [[land]] triumphant on his native shore. 

old aeson restor'd to [[youth]] 

aemonian matrons, who their absence mourn'd, 
rejoyce to see their prosp'rous sons [[son]] return'd: 
rich curling fumes of incense feast the skies [[sky]], 
an hecatomb of voted victims dies, 
with gilded horns, and garlands on their head, 
and all the pomp of [[death]], to th' altar [[led]]. 
congratulating bowls go briskly round, 
triumphant shouts in louder musick drown'd. 
amidst these revels, why that cloud of [[care]] 
on jason's brow? (to whom the largest share 
of mirth was due)- his [[father]] was not there. 
aeson was absent, once the [[young]], and brave, 
now crush'd with years, and bending to the grave. 
at [[last]] withdrawn, and by the crowd unseen, 
pressing her hand (with starting sighs between), 
he supplicates his [[kind]], and skilful queen. 

o patroness! preserver of my life! 
(dear when my mistress, and much dearer wife) 
your favours to so vast a sum amount, 
'tis [[past]] the pow'r of numbers to recount; 
or cou'd they be to computation brought, 
the [[history]] would a romance be [[thought]]: 
and yet, unless you add one favour more, 
greater than all that you conferr'd before, 
but not too hard for [[love]] and magick [[skill]], 
your [[past]] are thrown away, and jason's wretched still. 
the morning of my [[life]] is just begun, 
but my declining father's [[race]] is run; 
from my large stock retrench the long arrears, 
and add 'em to expiring aeson's years. 

thus spake the gen'rous [[youth]], and wept the rest. 
mov'd with the piety of his request, 
to his ag'd sire such filial [[duty]] shown, 
so diff'rent from her treatment of her own, 
but still endeav'ring her remorse to hide, 
she check'd her rising sighs, and thus reply'd. 

how cou'd the [[thought]] of such inhuman [[wrong]] 
escape (said she) from pious jason's tongue? 
does the whole [[world]] another jason bear, 
whose [[life]] medea can to yours prefer? 
or cou'd i with so dire a [[change]] dispence, 
hecate will never join in that offence: 
unjust is the request you make, and i 
in [[kindness]] your petition shall deny; 
yet she that grants not what you do implore, 
shall yet essay to give her jason more; 
find means t' encrease the stock of aeson's years, 
without retrenchment of your life's arrears; 
provided that the triple [[goddess]] join 
a [[strong]] confed'rate in my bold design. 

thus was her enterprize resolv'd; but still 
three tedious nights are wanting to fulfil 
the circling crescents of th' encreasing moon; 
then, in the height of her nocturnal noon, 
medea steals from court; her ankles bare, 
her garments closely girt, but loose her hair; 
thus sally'd, like a solitary sprite, 
she traverses the terrors of the night. 

men, beasts, and birds in soft repose lay charm'd, 
no boistrous wind the mountain-woods alarm'd; 
nor did those walks of [[love]], the myrtle-trees, 
of am'rous zephir hear the whisp'ring breeze; 
all elements chain'd in unactive rest, 
no sense but what the twinkling stars exprest; 
to them (that only wak'd) she rears her arm, 
and thus commences her mysterious charms. 

she turn'd her thrice about, as oft she threw 
on her pale tresses the nocturnal dew; 
then yelling thrice a most enormous sound, 
her bare knee bended on the flinty ground. 
o night (said she) thou confident and guide 
of secrets, such as darkness ought to hide; 
ye stars and moon, that, when the sun retires, 
support his [[empire]] with succeeding fires [[fire]]; 
and thou, [[great]] hecate, friend to my design; 
songs, mutt'ring spells, your magick forces [[force]] join; 
and thou, o [[earth]], the magazine that yields 
the midnight sorcerer drugs; skies [[sky]], mountains, fields; 
ye wat'ry pow'rs of fountain, stream, and lake; 
ye sylvan gods, and gods of night, awake, 
and gen'rously your parts in my adventure take. 

oft by your aid swift currents i have [[led]] 
thro' wand'ring banks, back to their fountain head; 
transformed the prospect of the briny deep, 
made sleeping billows rave, and raving billows sleep; 
made clouds, or sunshine; tempests rise, or fall; 
and stubborn lawless winds obey my call: 
with mutter'd words disarm'd the viper's jaw; 
up by the roots vast oaks, and rocks cou'd draw, 
make forests dance, and trembling mountains come, 
like malefactors, to receive their doom; 
earth groan, and frighted ghosts forsake their tomb. 
thee, cynthia, my resistless rhymes drew down, 
when tinkling cymbals strove my voice to drown; 
nor stronger titan could their [[force]] sustain, 
in full [[career]] compell'd to stop his wain: 
nor could aurora's virgin blush avail, 
with pois'nous herbs i turn'd her roses pale; 
the fury of the fiery bulls i broke, 
their stubborn necks submitting to my yoke; 
and when the sons [[son]] of [[earth]] with fury burn'd, 
their hostile rage upon themselves i turn'd; 
the brothers [[brother]] made with mutual wounds to bleed, 
and by their fatal strife my lover freed; 
and, while the dragon slept, to distant greece, 
thro' cheated guards, convey'd the golden fleece. 
but now to bolder action i proceed, 
of such prevailing juices now have need, 
that wither'd years back to their bloom can bring, 
and in [[dead]] winter raise a second spring. 
and you'll perform't- 
you will; for lo! the stars, with sparkling fires [[fire]], 
presage as bright [[success]] to my desires [[desire]]: 
and now another [[happy]] omen see! 
a chariot drawn by dragons waits for me. 

with these [[last]] words he leaps into the wain, 
stroaks the snakes' necks, and shakes the golden rein; 
that signal giv'n, they mount her to the skies [[sky]], 
and now beneath her fruitful tempe lies [[lie]], 
whose stories she ransacks, then to crete she flies; 
there ossa, pelion, othrys, pindus, all 
to the [[fair]] ravisher, a booty fall; 
the tribute of their verdure she collects, 
nor proud olympus' height his plants protects. 
some by the roots she plucks; the tender tops 
of others with her culling sickle crops. 
nor could the plunder of the hills suffice, 
down to the humble vales, and meads she flies; 
apidanus, amphrysus, the next rape 
sustain, nor could enipeus' bank escape; 
thro' beebe's marsh, and thro' the border rang'd 
whose pasture glaucus to a triton chang'd. 

now the ninth day, and ninth successive night, 
had wonder'd at the restless rover's flight; 
mean-while her dragons, fed with no repast, 
but her exhaling simples od'rous blast, 
their tarnish'd scales, and wrinkled skins had cast. 
at [[last]] return'd before her palace gate, 
quitting her chariot, on the ground she sate; 
the [[sky]] her only canopy of [[state]]. 
all conversation with her [[sex]] she fled, 
shun'd the caresses of the nuptial bed: 
two altars next of grassy turf she rears, 
this hecate's name, that youth's inscription bears; 
with forest-boughs, and vervain these she crown'd; 
then delves a double trench in lower ground, 
and sticks a black-fleec'd ram, that ready stood, 
and drench'd the ditches with devoted [[blood]]: 
new wine she pours, and milk from th' udder warm, 
with mystick murmurs to compleat the charm, 
and subterranean deities alarm. 
to the stern [[king]] of ghosts she next apply'd, 
and gentle proserpine, his ravish'd bride, 
that for old aeson with the laws [[law]] of [[fate]] 
they would dispense, and lengthen his short date; 
thus with repeated pray'rs she long assails 
th' infernal [[tyrant]] and at [[last]] prevails; 
then calls to have decrepit aeson brought, 
and stupifies him with a sleeping draught; 
on [[earth]] his [[body]], like a corpse, extends, 
then charges jason and his waiting [[friends]] 
to quit the place, that no unhallow'd eye 
into her art's forbidden secrets pry. 
this done, th' inchantress, with her locks unbound, 
about her altars trips a frantick round; 
piece-meal the consecrated wood she splits, 
and dips the splinters in the bloody pits, 
then hurles 'em on the piles; the sleeping sire 
she lustrates thrice, with sulphur, water, [[fire]]. 

in a large cauldron now the med'cine boils, 
compounded of her late-collected spoils, 
blending into the mesh the various pow'rs 
of wonder-working juices, roots, and flow'rs; 
with gems i' th' eastern ocean's cell refin'd, 
and such as ebbing tides had left behind; 
to them the midnight's pearly dew she flings, 
a scretch-owl's carcase, and ill boding wings; 
nor could the wizard wolf's warm entrails scape 
(that wolf who counterfeits a [[human]] shape). 
then, from the bottom of her conj'ring bag, 
snakes' skins, and liver of a long-liv'd stag; 
last a crow's head to such an [[age]] arriv'd, 
that he had now nine centuries surviv'd; 
these, and with these a thousand more that grew 
in sundry soils, into her pot she threw; 
then with a wither'd olive-bough she rakes 
the bubling broth; the bough fresh verdure takes; 
green leaves at first the perish'd plant surround, 
which the next minute with ripe fruit were crown'd. 
the foaming juices now the brink o'er-swell; 
the barren heath, where-e'er the liquor fell, 
sprang out with vernal grass, and all the [[pride]] 
of blooming may- when this medea spy'd, 
she cuts her patient's throat; th' exhausted [[blood]] 
recruiting with her new enchanted flood; 
while at his mouth, and thro' his op'ning wound, 
a double inlet her infusion found; 
his feeble frame resumes a youthful air, 
a glossy brown his hoary beard and hair. 
the meager paleness from his aspect fled, 
and in its room sprang up a florid red; 
thro' all his limbs a youthful vigour flies, 
his empty'd art'ries swell with fresh supplies: 
gazing spectators scarce [[believe]] their [[eyes]]. 
but aeson is the most surpriz'd to find 
a [[happy]] [[change]] in [[body]] and in [[mind]]; 
in sense and [[constitution]] the same [[man]], 
as when his fortieth active year began. 

bacchus, who from the clouds this wonder view'd, 
medea's method instantly pursu'd, 
and his indulgent nurse's [[youth]] renew'd. 

the [[death]] of pelias 

thus far obliging [[love]] employ'd her art [[arts]], 
but now [[revenge]] must act a tragick part; 

medea feigns a mortal quarrel bred 
betwixt her, and the partner of her bed; 
on this pretence to pelias' court she flies, 
who languishing with [[age]] and sickness lies [[lie]]: 
his guiltless daughters [[daughter]], with inveigling wiles, 
and well dissembled [[friendship]], she beguiles: 
the [[strange]] achievements of her art [[arts]] she tells, 
with aeson's cure, and long on that she dwells, 
'till them to firm perswasion she has won, 
the same for their old [[father]] may be done: 
for him they court her to employ her [[skill]], 
and put upon the cure what price she will. 
at first she's mute, and with a grave pretence 
of difficulty, holds 'em in suspense; 
then promises, and bids 'em, from the fold 
chuse out a ram, the most infirm and old; 
that so by [[fact]] their doubts [[doubt]] may be remov'd, 
and first on him the operation prov'd. 

a wreath-horn'd ram is brought, so far o'er-grown 
with years, his [[age]] was to that [[age]] unknown 
of sense too dull the piercing point to [[feel]], 
and scarce sufficient [[blood]] to stain the steel. 
his carcass she into a cauldron threw, 
with drugs whose vital qualities she knew; 
his limbs grow less, he casts his horns, and years, 
and tender bleatings strike their wond'ring ears. 
then instantly leaps forth a frisking lamb, 
that seeks (too [[young]] to graze) a suckling dam. 
the sisters, thus confirm'd with the [[success]], 
her promise with renew'd entreaty press; 
to countenance the [[cheat]], three nights and days 
before experiment th' inchantress stays; 
then into limpid water, from the springs, 
weeds, and ingredients of no [[force]] she flings; 
with antique ceremonies [[ceremony]] for pretence 
and rambling rhymes without a word of sense. 

mean-while the [[king]] with all his guards lay bound 
in magick sleep, scarce that of [[death]] so sound; 
the daughters [[daughter]] now are by the sorc'ress [[led]] 
into his chamber, and surround his bed. 
your father's health's concern'd, and can ye stay? 
unnat'ral nymphs [[nymph]], why this unkind delay? 
unsheath your swords [[sword]], dismiss his lifeless [[blood]], 
and i'll recruit it with a vital flood: 
your father's [[life]] and health is in your hand, 
and can ye thus like idle gazers stand? 
unless you are of [[common]] sense bereft, 
if yet one spark of piety is left, 
dispatch a father's cure, and disengage 
the monarch from his toilsome load of [[age]]: 
come- drench your [[weapons]] in his putrid gore; 
'tis charity to wound, when wounding will restore. 

thus urg'd, the [[poor]] deluded maids proceed, 
betray'd by zeal, to an inhumane deed, 
and, in compassion, make a [[father]] bleed. 
yes, she who had the kindest, tend'rest [[heart]], 
is foremost to perform the bloody part. 

yet, tho' to act the butchery betray'd, 
they could not bear to see the wounds they made; 
with looks averted, backward they advance, 
then strike, and stab, and leave the blows to [[chance]]. 

waking in consternation, he essays 
(weltring in blood) his feeble arms to raise: 
environ'd with so many swords- from whence 
this barb'rous usage? what is my offence? 
what fatal fury, what infernal charm, 
'gainst a [[kind]] [[father]] does his daughters [[daughter]] arm? 

hearing his voice, as thunder-struck they stopt, 
their resolution, and their [[weapons]] dropt: 
medea then the mortal blow bestows, 
and that perform'd, the tragick scene to close, 
his corpse into the boiling cauldron throws. 

then, dreading the [[revenge]] that must ensue, 
high mounted on her dragon-coach she flew; 
and in her stately [[progress]] thro' the skies [[sky]], 
beneath her shady pelion first she spies, 
with othrys, that above the clouds did rise; 
with skilful chiron's cave, and neighb'ring ground, 
for old cerambus' [[strange]] escape renown'd, 
by nymphs [[nymph]] deliver'd, when the [[world]] was drown'd; 
who him with unexpected wings supply'd, 
when delug'd hills a safe retreat deny'd. 
aeolian pitane on her left hand 
she saw, and there the statu'd dragon stand; 
with ida's grove, where bacchus, to [[disguise]] 
his son's bold theft, and to secure the prize, 
made the stoln steer a stag to represent; 
cocytus' father's sandy monument; 
and fields that held the murder'd sire's remains, 
where howling moera frights the startled plains. 
euryphilus' high town, with tow'rs defac'd 
by hercules, and matrons more disgrac'd 
with sprouting horns, in signal [[punishment]], 
from juno, or resenting [[venus]] sent. 
then rhodes, which phoebus did so dearly prize, 
and jove no less severely did chastize; 
for he the wizard native's pois'ning sight, 
that us'd the farmer's hopeful crops to blight, 
in rage o'erwhelm'd with everlasting night. 
cartheia's ancient walls come next in view, 
where once the sire almost a statue grew 
with wonder, which a [[strange]] event did move, 
his [[daughter]] turn'd into a turtle-dove. 
then hyrie's lake, and tempe's field o'er-ran, 
fam'd for the boy who there became a swan; 
for there enamour'd phyllius, like a [[slave]], 
perform'd what tasks his paramour would crave. 
for presents [[present]] he had mountain-vultures caught, 
and from the desart a tame lion brought; 
then a wild bull commanded to subdue, 
the conquer'd savage by the horns he drew; 
but, mock'd so oft, the treatment he disdains, 
and from the craving boy this prize detains. 
then thus in choler the resenting lad: 
won't you deliver him?- you'll [[wish]] you had: 
nor sooner said, but, in a peevish mood, 
leapt from the precipice on which he stood: 
the standers-by were struck with fresh surprize, 
instead of falling, to behold him rise 
a snowy swan, and soaring to the skies [[sky]]. 

but dearly the rash prank his [[mother]] cost, 
who ignorantly gave her [[son]] for lost; 
for his misfortune wept, 'till she became 
a lake, and still renown'd with hyrie's name. 

thence to latona's isle, where once were seen, 
transform'd to birds, a monarch, and his queen. 
far off she saw how old cephisus mourn'd 
his [[son]], into a seele by phoebus turn'd; 
and where, astonish'd at a stranger sight, 
eumelus gaz'd on his wing'd daughter's flight. 

aetolian pleuron she did next survey, 
where sons [[son]] a mother's murder did essay, 
but sudden plumes the matron bore away. 
on her [[right]] hand, cyllene, a [[fair]] soil, 
fair, 'till menephron there the beauteous hill 
attempted with foul incest to defile. 

her harness'd dragons now direct she drives 
for corinth, and at corinth she arrives; 
where, if what old tradition tells, be true, 
in former ages [[age]] [[men]] from mushrooms grew. 

but here medea finds her bed supply'd, 
during her absence, by another bride; 
and hopeless to recover her lost game, 
she sets both bride and palace in a flame. 
nor could a rival's [[death]] her wrath asswage, 
nor stopt at creon's [[family]] her rage, 
she murders her own infants, in despight 
to faithless jason, and in jason's sight; 
yet e'er his [[sword]] could reach her, up she springs, 
securely mounted on her dragon's wings. 

the story of aegeus 

from hence to [[athens]] she directs her flight, 
where phineus, so renown'd for doing [[right]]; 
where periphas, and polyphemon's neece, 
soaring with sudden plumes amaz'd the towns of greece. 

here aegeus so engaging she addrest, 
that first he treats her like a [[royal]] guest; 
then takes the sorc'ress for his wedded [[wife]]; 
the only blemish of his prudent [[life]]. 

mean-while his [[son]], from actions of renown, 
arrives at court, but to his sire unknown. 
medea, to dispatch a dang'rous heir 
(she knew him), did a pois'nous draught prepare; 
drawn from a drug, was long reserv'd in store 
for desp'rate uses, from the scythian shore; 
that from the echydnaean monster's jaws 
deriv'd its origin, and this the cause. 

thro' a dark cave a craggy passage lies [[lie]], 
to ours, ascending from the nether skies [[sky]]; 
thro' which, by [[strength]] of hand, alcides drew 
chain'd cerberus, who lagg'd, and restive grew, 
with his blear'd [[eyes]] our brighter day to view. 
thrice he repeated his enormous yell, 
with which he scares the ghosts, and startles hell; 
at [[last]] outragious (tho' compell'd to yield) 
he sheds his foam in fury on the field,- 
which, with its own, and rankness of the ground, 
produc'd a weed, by sorcerers renown'd, 
the strongest [[constitution]] to confound; 
call'd aconite, because it can unlock 
all bars, and [[force]] its passage thro' a rock. 

the pious [[father]], by her wheedles won, 
presents this deadly potion to his [[son]]; 
who, with the same assurance takes the cup, 
and to the monarch's health had drank it up, 
but in the very instant he apply'd 
the goblet to his lips, old aegeus spy'd 
the iv'ry hilted [[sword]] that grac'd his side. 
that [[certain]] signal of his [[son]] he knew, 
and snatcht the bowl away; the [[sword]] he drew, 
resolv'd, for such a son's endanger'd [[life]], 
to [[sacrifice]] the most perfidious [[wife]]. 
revenge is swift, but her more active charms 
a whirlwind rais'd, that snatch'd her from his arms. 
while conjur'd clouds their baffled sense surprize, 
she vanishes from their deluded [[eyes]], 
and thro' the hurricane triumphant flies. 

the gen'rous [[king]], altho' o'er-joy'd to find 
his [[son]] was safe, yet bearing still in [[mind]] 
the mischief by his treach'rous queen design'd; 
the horrour of the deed, and then how near 
the danger drew, he stands congeal'd with [[fear]]. 
but soon that [[fear]] into devotion turns, 
with grateful incense ev'ry altar burns; 
proud victims, and unconscious of their [[fate]], 
stalk to the temple, there to [[die]] in [[state]]. 
in [[athens]] never had a day been found 
for mirth, like that grand festival, renown'd. 
promiscuously the peers, and [[people]] dine, 
promiscuously their thankful voices join, 
in songs [[song]] of wit, sublim'd by spritely wine. 
to list'ning spheres their joint applause they raise, 
and thus resound their matchless theseus' [[praise]]. 

great theseus! thee the marathonian plain 
admires, and wears with [[pride]] the [[noble]] stain 
of the dire monster's [[blood]], by valiant theseus slain. 
that now cromyon's swains in safety sow, 
and reap their fertile field, to thee they owe. 
by thee th' infested epidaurian coast 
was clear'd, and now can a [[free]] commerce boast. 
the traveller his [[journey]] can pursue, 
with [[pleasure]] the late dreadful valley view, 
and cry, here theseus the grand robber slew. 
cephysus' cries to his rescu'd shore, 
the merciless procrustes is no more. 
in [[peace]], eleusis, ceres' rites renew, 
since theseus' [[sword]] the fierce cercyon slew. 
by him the tort'rer sinis was destroy'd, 
of [[strength]] (but [[strength]] to barb'rous use employ'd) 
that tops of tallest pines to [[earth]] could bend, 
and thus in pieces wretched captives rend. 
inhuman scyron now has breath'd his [[last]], 
and now alcatho's roads securely [[past]]; 
by theseus slain, and thrown into the deep: 
but [[earth]] nor sea his scatter'd bones wou'd keep, 
which, after floating long, a rock became, 
still infamous with scyron's hated name. 
when fame to count thy acts and years proceeds, 
thy years appear but cyphers to thy deeds. 
for thee, brave [[youth]], as for our common-wealth, 
we [[pray]]; and drink, in yours, the publick health. 
your [[praise]] the senate, and plebeians sing, 
with your lov'd name the court, and cottage ring. 
you make our shepherds and our sailors glad, 
and not a house in this vast city's [[sad]]. 

but mortal bliss will never come sincere, 
pleasure may lead, but [[grief]] brings up the rear; 
while for his sons' arrival, rev'ling joy 
aegeus, and all his subjects [[subject]] does employ; 
while they for only costly feasts prepare, 
his neighb'ring monarch, minos, threatens [[war]]: 
weak in land-forces, nor by sea more [[strong]], 
but pow'rful in a deep resented [[wrong]] 
for a son's murder, arm'd with pious rage; 
yet prudently before he would engage, 
to raise auxiliaries resolv'd to sail, 
and with the pow'rful princes [[prince]] to prevail. 

first anaphe, then proud astypalaea gains, 
by presents [[present]] that, and this by threats obtains: 
low mycone, cymolus, chalky soil, 
tall cythnos, scyros, flat seriphos' isle; 
paros, with marble cliffs afar display'd; 
impregnable sithonia; yet betray'd 
to a [[weak]] foe by a gold-admiring maid, 
who, chang'd into a daw of sable hue, 
still hoards up gold, and hides it from the view. 

but as these islands chearfully combine, 
others refuse t' embark in his design. 
now leftward with an easy sail he bore, 
and prosp'rous passage to oenopia's shore; 
oenopia once, but now aegina call'd, 
and with his [[royal]] mother's name install'd 
by aeacus, under whose reign did spring 
the myrmidons, and now their reigning [[king]]. 

down to the port, amidst the rabble, run 
the princes [[prince]] of the [[blood]]; with telamon, 
peleus the next, and phocus the third [[son]]: 
then aeacus, altho' opprest with years, 
to ask the cause of their approach appears. 

that [[question]] does the gnossian's [[grief]] renew, 
and sighs from his afflicted bosom drew; 
yet after a short solemn respite made, 
the ruler of the hundred cities [[city]] said: 

assist our arms, rais'd for a murder'd [[son]], 
in this [[religious]] [[war]] no risque you'll run: 
revenge the dead- for who refuse to give 
rest to their urns, unworthy are to [[live]]. 

what you request, thus aeacus replies, 
not i, but [[truth]] and [[common]] [[faith]] denies; 
athens and we have long been sworn allies: 
our leagues are fix'd, confed'rate are our pow'rs, 
and who declare themselves their foes, are ours. 

minos rejoins, your league shall dearly cost 
(yet, mindful how much safer 'twas to boast, 
than there to waste his forces [[force]], and his fame, 
before in field with his grand foe he came), 
parts without blows- nor long had left the shore, 
e're into port another navy bore, 
with cephalus, and all his jolly crew; 
th' aeacides their old acquaintance knew: 
the princes [[prince]] bid him welcome, and in [[state]] 
conduct the heroe to their palace gate; 
who entr'ring, seem'd the charming mein to wear, 
as when in [[youth]] he paid his visit there. 
in his [[right]] hand an olive-branch he holds, 
and, salutation [[past]], the [[chief]] unfolds 
his embassy from the athenian [[state]], 
their mutual [[friendship]], leagues of ancient date; 
their [[common]] danger, ev'ry thing cou'd wake 
concern, and his address successful make: 
strength'ning his plea with all the charms of sense, 
and those, with all the charms of eloquence. 

then thus the [[king]]: like suitors do you stand 
for that assistance which you may command? 
athenians, all our listed forces [[force]] use 
(they're such as no bold service will refuse); 
and when y' ave drawn them off, the gods be prais'd, 
fresh legions can within our isle be rais'd: 
so stock'd with [[people]], that we can prepare 
both for domestick, and for distant [[war]], 
ours, or our friends' insulters to chastize. 

long may ye flourish thus, the [[prince]] replies. 
strange transport seiz'd me as i pass'd along, 
to meet so many [[troops]], and all so [[young]], 
as if your [[army]] did of twins consist; 
yet amongst them my late acquaintance miss'd: 
ev'n all that to your palace did resort, 
when first you entertain'd me at your court; 
and cannot guess the cause from whence cou'd spring 
so vast a change- then thus the sighing [[king]]: 

illustrious guest, to my [[strange]] tale attend, 
of [[sad]] beginning, but a joyful end: 
the whole to a vast [[history]] wou'd swell, 
i shall but half, and that confus'dly, tell. 
that [[race]] whom so deserv'dly you admir'd, 
are all into their silent tombs retir'd: 
they fell; and falling, how they shook my [[state]], 
thought may conceive, but words can ne'er relate. 

the story of ants chang'd to [[men]] 

a dreadful plague from angry juno came, 
to scourge the [[land]], that bore her rival's name; 
before her fatal anger was reveal'd, 
and teeming malice lay as yet conceal'd, 
all remedies we try, all med'cines use, 
which [[nature]] cou'd supply, or art [[arts]] [[produce]]; 
th' unconquer'd foe derides the [[vain]] design, 
and art [[arts]], and [[nature]] foil'd, declare the cause [[divine]]. 

at first we only [[felt]] th' oppressive weight 
of gloomy clouds, then teeming with our [[fate]], 
and lab'ring to discarge unactive heat: 
but ere four moons alternate changes [[change]] knew, 
with deadly blasts the fatal south-wind blew, 
infected all the air, and poison'd as it flew. 
our fountains too a dire infection yield, 
for crowds of vipers creep along the field, 
and with polluted gore, and baneful steams, 
taint all the lakes, and venom all the streams. 

the [[young]] disease with milder [[force]] began, 
and rag'd on birds, and beasts, excusing [[man]]. 
the lab'ring oxen fall before the plow, 
th' unhappy plow-men stare, and wonder how: 
the tabid sheep, with sickly bleatings, pines; 
its wool decreasing, as its [[strength]] declines: 
the warlike steed, by inward foes compell'd, 
neglects his honours [[honour]], and deserts the field; 
unnerv'd, and languid, seeks a base retreat, 
and at the manger groans, but wish'd a nobler [[fate]]: 
the stags forget their speed, the boars their rage, 
nor can the bears the stronger herds engage: 
a gen'ral faintness does invade 'em all, 
and in the woods, and fields, promiscuously they fall. 
the air receives the stench, and (strange to say) 
the rav'nous birds and beasts avoid the prey: 
th' offensive bodies [[body]] rot upon the ground, 
and spread the dire contagion all around. 

but now the plague, grown to a larger size, 
riots on [[man]], and scorns a meaner prize. 
intestine heats begin the civil [[war]], 
and flushings first the latent flame declare, 
and breath inspir'd, which seem'd like fiery air. 
their black dry tongues are swell'd, and scarce can move,

and short thick sighs from panting lung are drove. 
they gape for air, with flatt'ring hopes [[hope]] t' abate 
their raging flames, but that augments their heat. 
no bed, no cov'ring can the wretches bear, 
but on the ground, expos'd to open air, 
they lye, and [[hope]] to find a pleasing coolness there. 
the suff'ring [[earth]] with that oppression curst, 
returns the heat which they imparted first. 

in [[vain]] physicians would bestow their aid, 
vain all their art [[arts]], and useless all their [[trade]]; 
and they, ev'n they, who fleeting [[life]] recall, 
feel the same pow'rs, and undistinguish'd fall. 
if any proves so daring to attend 
his sick companion, or his darling friend, 
th' officious wretch sucks in contagious breath, 
and with his friend does sympathize in [[death]]. 

and now the [[care]] and hopes [[hope]] of [[life]] are [[past]], 
they please their fancies, and indulge their taste; 
at brooks and streams, regardless of their shame, 
each [[sex]], promiscuous, strives to quench their flame; 
nor do they strive in [[vain]] to quench it there, 
for thirst, and [[life]] at once extinguish'd are. 
thus in the brooks the dying bodies [[body]] sink, 
but heedless still the rash survivors drink. 

so much uneasy down the wretches hate, 
they fly their beds, to struggle with their [[fate]]; 
but if decaying [[strength]] forbids to rise, 
the victim crawls and rouls, 'till on the ground he lies [[lie]].

each shuns his bed, as each wou'd shun his tomb, 
and thinks [[think]] th' infection only lodg'd at [[home]]. 

here one, with fainting steps, does slowly creep 
o'er heaps of [[dead]], and strait augments the heap; 
another, while his [[strength]] and tongue prevail'd, 
bewails his friend, and falls himself bewail'd: 
this with imploring looks surveys the skies [[sky]], 
the [[last]] dear office of his closing [[eyes]], 
but finds the heav'ns implacable, and dies. 

what now, ah! what employ'd my troubled [[mind]]? 
but only hopes [[hope]] my subjects' [[fate]] to find. 
what place soe'er my weeping [[eyes]] survey, 
there in lamented heaps the vulgar lay; 
as acorns scatter when the winds prevail, 
or mellow fruit from shaken branches fall. 

you see that dome which rears its front so high: 
'tis [[sacred]] to the monarch of the [[sky]]: 
how many there, with unregarded tears, 
and fruitless vows, sent up successless pray'rs? 
there fathers [[father]] for expiring sons [[son]] implor'd, 
and there the [[wife]] bewail'd her gasping [[lord]]; 
with pious off'rings they'd appease the skies [[sky]], 
but they, ere yet th' attoning vapours rise, 
before the altars fall, themselves a [[sacrifice]]: 
they fall, while yet their hands the gums contain, 
the gums surviving, but their off'rers slain. 

the destin'd ox, with holy garlands crown'd, 
prevents the blow, and feels [[feel]] th' expected wound: 
when i my [[self]] invok'd the pow'rs [[divine]], 
to drive the fatal pest from me and mine; 
when now the [[priest]] with hands uplifted stood, 
prepar'd to strike, and shed the [[sacred]] [[blood]], 
the gods themselves the mortal stroke bestow, 
the victim falls, but they impart the blow: 
scarce was the knife with the pale purple stain'd, 
and no presages cou'd be then obtain'd, 
from putrid entrails, where th' infection reign'd. 

death stalk'd around with such resistless sway, 
the temples of the gods his [[force]] obey, 
and suppliants [[feel]] his stroke, while yet they [[pray]]. 
go now, said he, your deities implore 
for fruitless aid, for i defie their pow'r. 
then with a curst malicious joy survey'd 
the very altars, stain'd with trophies of the [[dead]]. 

the rest grown mad, and frantick with despair, 
urge their own [[fate]], and so prevent the [[fear]]. 
strange madness that, when [[death]] pursu'd so fast, 
t' anticipate the blow with impious haste. 

no decent honours [[honour]] to their urns are paid, 
nor cou'd the graves receive the num'rous [[dead]]; 
for, or they lay unbury'd on the ground, 
or unadorn'd a needy fun'ral found: 
all rev'rence [[past]], the fainting wretches [[fight]] 
for fun'ral piles which were another's [[right]]. 

unmourn'd they fall: for, who surviv'd to mourn? 
and sires, and mothers [[mother]] unlamented burn: 
parents, and sons [[son]] sustain an [[equal]] [[fate]], 
and wand'ring ghosts their kindred shadows meet. 
the [[dead]] a larger space of ground require, 
nor are the trees sufficient for the [[fire]]. 

despairing under grief's oppressive weight, 
and sunk by these tempestuous blasts of [[fate]], 
o jove, said i, if [[common]] fame says true, 
if e'er aegina gave those joys to you, 
if e'er you lay enclos'd in her embrace, 
fond of her charms, and eager to possess; 
o [[father]], if you do not yet disclaim 
paternal [[care]], nor yet disown the name; 
grant my petitions, and with speed restore 
my subjects [[subject]] num'rous as they were before, 
or make me partner of the [[fate]] they bore. 
i spoke, and glorious lightning shone around, 
and ratling thunder gave a prosp'rous sound; 
so let it be, and may these omens prove 
a pledge, said i, of your returning [[love]]. 

by [[chance]] a rev'rend oak was near the place, 
sacred to jove, and of dodona's [[race]], 
where frugal ants laid up their winter meat, 
whose little bodies [[body]] bear a mighty weight: 
we saw them march along, and hide their store, 
and much admir'd their number, and their pow'r; 
admir'd at first, but after envy'd more. 
full of amazement, thus to jove i pray'd, 
o grant, since thus my subjects [[subject]] are decay'd, 
as many subjects [[subject]] to supply the [[dead]]. 
i pray'd, and [[strange]] convulsions mov'd the oak, 
which murmur'd, tho' by ambient winds unshook: 
my trembling hands, and stiff-erected hair, 
exprest all tokens of uncommon [[fear]]; 
yet both the [[earth]] and [[sacred]] oak i kist, 
and scarce cou'd [[hope]], yet still i hop'd the [[best]]; 
for wretches, whatsoe'er the fates [[fate]] [[divine]], 
expound all omens to their own design. 

but now 'twas night, when ev'n distraction wears 
a pleasing look, and dreams [[dream]] beguile our cares [[care]], 
lo! the same oak appears before my [[eyes]], 
nor alter'd in his shape, nor former size; 
as many ants the num'rous branches bear, 
the same their [[labour]], and their frugal [[care]]; 
the branches too a like commotion sound, 
and shook th' industrious creatures on the ground, 
who, by degrees [[degree]] (what's scarce to be believ'd) 
a nobler form, and larger bulk receiv'd, 
and on the [[earth]] walk'd an unusual pace, 
with manly strides, and an erected face- 
their num'rous legs, and former colour lost, 
the insects cou'd a [[human]] figure boast. 

i wake, and waking find my cares [[care]] again, 
and to the unperforming gods [[complain]], 
and call their promise, and pretences, [[vain]]. 
yet in my court i heard the murm'ring voice 
of strangers, and a mixt uncommon noise: 
but i suspected all was still a [[dream]], 
'till telamon to my apartment came, 
op'ning the door with an impetuous haste, 
o come, said he, and see your [[faith]] and hopes [[hope]] surpast: 
i [[follow]], and, confus'd with wonder, view 
those shapes which my presaging slumbers drew: 
i saw, and own'd, and call'd them subjects [[subject]]; they 
confest my pow'r, submissive to my sway. 
to jove, restorer of my [[race]] decay'd, 
my vows were first with due oblations paid, 
i then divide with an [[impartial]] hand 
my empty [[city]], and my ruin'd [[land]], 
to give the new-born [[youth]] an [[equal]] share, 
and call them myrmidons, from what they were. 
you saw their persons [[person]], and they still retain 
the thrift of ants, tho' now transform'd to [[men]]. 
a frugal [[people]], and inur'd to sweat, 
lab'ring to gain, and keeping what they get. 
these, [[equal]] both in [[strength]] and years, shall join 
their willing aid, and [[follow]] your design, 
with the first southern gale that shall [[present]] 
to fill your sails, and favour your intent. 

with such discourse they entertain the day; 
the ev'ning [[past]] in banquets, [[sport]], and play: 
then, having crown'd the night with sweet repose, 
aurora (with the wind at east) arose. 
now pallas' sons [[son]] to cephalus resort, 
and cephalus with pallas' sons [[son]] to court, 
to the king's levee; him sleep's silken chain, 
and pleasing dreams [[dream]], beyond his hour detain; 
but then the princes [[prince]] of the [[blood]], in [[state]], 
expect, and meet 'em at the palace gate. 

the story of cephalus and procris 

to th' inmost courts the grecian youths [[youth]] were [[led]], 
and plac'd by phocus on a tyrian bed; 
who, soon observing cephalus to hold 
a dart of unknown wood, but arm'd with gold: 
none [[better]] loves [[love]] (said he) the huntsman's [[sport]], 
or does more often to the woods resort; 
yet i that jav'lin's stem with wonder view, 
too brown for box, too smooth a grain for yew. 
i cannot guess the tree; but never art [[arts]] 
did form, or [[eyes]] behold so [[fair]] a dart! 
the guest then interrupts him- 'twou'd [[produce]] 
still greater wonder, if you knew its use. 
it never fails to strike the game, and then 
comes bloody back into your hand again. 
then phocus each particular desires [[desire]], 
and th' author of the wond'rous gift enquires. 
to which the owner thus, with weeping [[eyes]], 
and [[sorrow]] for his wife's [[sad]] [[fate]], replies, 
this weapon here (o prince!) can you [[believe]] 
this dart the cause for which so much i grieve; 
and shall continue to grieve on, 'till [[fate]] 
afford such wretched [[life]] no longer date. 
would i this fatal gift had ne'er enjoy'd, 
this fatal gift my tender [[wife]] destroy'd: 
procris her name, ally'd in charms and [[blood]] 
to [[fair]] orythia courted by a [[god]]. 
her [[father]] seal'd my hopes [[hope]] with rites [[divine]], 
but firmer [[love]] before had made her mine. 
men call'd me blest, and blest i was indeed. 
the second month our nuptials did succeed; 
when (as upon hymettus' dewy head, 
for mountain stags my net betimes i spread) 
aurora spy'd, and ravish'd me away, 
with rev'rence to the [[goddess]], i must say, 
against my will, for procris had my [[heart]], 
nor wou'd her image from my thoughts [[thought]] depart. 
at [[last]], in rage she cry'd, ingrateful boy 
go to your procris, take your fatal joy; 
and so dismiss'd me: musing, as i went, 
what those expressions of the [[goddess]] meant, 
a thousand [[jealous]] fears [[fear]] possess me now, 
lest procris had prophan'd her nuptial vow: 
her [[youth]] and charms did to my fancy paint 
a lewd adultress, but her [[life]] a saint. 
yet i was absent long, the [[goddess]] too 
taught me how far a woman cou'd be true. 
aurora's treatment much suspicion bred; 
besides, who truly [[love]], ev'n shadows dread. 
i strait impatient for the tryal grew, 
what courtship back'd with richest gifts cou'd do. 
aurora's envy aided my design, 
and lent me features far unlike to mine. 
in this [[disguise]] to my own house i came, 
but all was chaste, no conscious sign of blame: 
with thousand [[arts]] i scarce admittance found, 
and then beheld her weeping on the ground 
for her lost husband; hardly i retain'd 
my [[purpose]], scarce the wish'd embrace refrain'd. 
how charming was her grief! then, phocus, guess 
what killing beauties [[beauty]] waited on her dress. 
her constant [[answer]], when my suit i prest, 
forbear, my lord's dear image guards this breast; 
where-e'er he is, whatever cause detains, 
who-e'er has his, my [[heart]] unmov'd remains. 
what greater proofs of [[truth]] than these cou'd be? 
yet i persist, and urge my [[destiny]]. 
at length, she found, when my own form return'd, 
her [[jealous]] lover there, whose loss she mourn'd. 
enrag'd with my suspicion, swift as wind, 
she fled at once from me and all [[mankind]]; 
and so became, her [[purpose]] to retain, 
a [[nymph]], and huntress in diana's train: 
forsaken thus, i found my flames encrease, 
i own'd my folly, and i su'd for [[peace]]. 
it was a [[fault]], but not of guilt, to move 
such [[punishment]], a [[fault]] of too much [[love]]. 
thus i retriev'd her to my longing arms, 
and many [[happy]] days possess'd her charms. 
but with herself she kindly did confer, 
what gifts the [[goddess]] had bestow'd on her; 
the fleetest grey-hound, with this lovely dart, 
and i of both have wonders to impart. 
near thebes a savage beast, of [[race]] unknown, 
laid waste the field, and bore the vineyards down; 
the swains fled from him, and with one [[consent]] 
our grecian [[youth]] to chase the monster went; 
more swift than light'ning he the toils surpast, 
and in his course spears, [[men]], and trees o'er-cast. 
we slipt our dogs, and [[last]] my lelaps too, 
when none of all the mortal [[race]] wou'd do: 
he long before was struggling from my hands, 
and, e're we cou'd unloose him, broke his bands. 
that minute where he was, we cou'd not find, 
and only saw the dust he left behind. 
i climb'd a neighb'ring hill to view the chase, 
while in the plain they held an [[equal]] [[race]]; 
the savage now seems caught, and now by [[force]] 
to quit himself, nor holds the same strait course; 
but running counter, from the foe withdraws, 
and with short turning cheats his gaping jaws: 
which he retrieves, and still so closely prest, 
you'd [[fear]] at ev'ry stretch he were possess'd; 
yet for the gripe his fangs in [[vain]] prepare; 
the game shoots from him, and he chops the air. 
to cast my jav'lin then i took my stand; 
but as the thongs were fitting to my hand, 
while to the valley i o'er-look'd the wood, 
before my [[eyes]] two marble statues stood; 
that, as pursu'd appearing at full stretch, 
this barking after, and at point to catch: 
some [[god]] their course did with this wonder grace, 
that neither might be conquer'd in the chase. 
a sudden [[silence]] here his tongue supprest, 
he here stops short, and fain wou'd wave the rest. 

the eager [[prince]] then urg'd him to impart, 
the [[fortune]] that attended on the dart. 
first then (said he) [[past]] joys let me relate, 
for bliss was the foundation of my [[fate]]. 
no [[language]] can those [[happy]] hours express, 
did from our nuptials me, and procris bless: 
the kindest pair! what more cou'd heav'n confer? 
for she was all to me, and i to her. 
had jove made [[love]], [[great]] jove had been despis'd; 
and i my procris more than [[venus]] priz'd: 
thus while no other joy we did aspire, 
we grew at [[last]] one [[soul]], and one [[desire]]. 
forth to the woods i went at break of day 
(the constant practice of my youth) for prey: 
nor yet for servant, horse, or dog did call, 
i found this [[single]] dart to serve for all. 
with slaughter tir'd, i sought the cooler shade, 
and winds that from the mountains pierc'd the glade: 
come, gentle air (so was i wont to say) 
come, gentle air, sweet aura come away. 
this always was the burden of my [[song]], 
come 'swage my flames, sweet aura come along. 
thou always art [[arts]] most welcome to my breast; 
i faint; approach, thou dearest, kindest guest! 
these blandishments, and more than these, i said 
(by [[fate]] to unsuspected ruin led), 
thou art [[arts]] my joy, for thy dear sake i [[love]] 
each desart hill, and solitary grove; 
when (faint with labour) i refreshment need, 
for cordials on thy fragrant breath i feed. 
at [[last]] a wand'ring swain in hearing came, 
and cheated with the sound of aura's name, 
he [[thought]] i some assignation made; 
and to my procris' ear the news convey'd. 
great [[love]] is soonest with suspicion fir'd: 
she swoon'd, and with the tale almost expir'd. 
ah! wretched heart! (she cry'd) ah! faithless [[man]]. 
and then to curse th' imagin'd [[nymph]] began: 
yet oft she doubts [[doubt]], oft hopes [[hope]] she is deceiv'd, 
and chides herself, that ever she believ'd 
her [[lord]] to such [[injustice]] cou'd proceed, 
'till she her [[self]] were witness of the deed. 
next morn i to the woods again repair, 
and, weary with the chase, invoke the air: 
approach, dear aura, and my bosom chear: 
at which a mournful sound did strike my ear; 
yet i proceeded, 'till the thicket by, 
with rustling noise and motion, drew my eye: 
i [[thought]] some beast of prey was shelter'd there, 
and to the covert threw my [[certain]] spear; 
from whence a tender sigh my [[soul]] did wound, 
ah me! it cry'd, and did like procris sound. 
procris was there, too well the voice i knew, 
and to the place with headlong [[horror]] flew; 
where i beheld her gasping on the ground, 
in [[vain]] attempting from the deadly wound 
to draw the dart, her love's dear fatal gift! 
my guilty arms had scarce the [[strength]] to lift 
the beauteous load; my silks, and hair i tore 
(if possible) to stanch the pressing gore; 
for [[pity]] beg'd her keep her flitting breath, 
and not to leave me guilty of her [[death]]. 
while i intreat she fainted fast away, 
and these few words had only [[strength]] to say: 
by all the [[sacred]] bonds of plighted [[love]], 
by all your rev'rence to the pow'rs above, 
by all the [[truth]] for which you held me dear, 
and [[last]] by [[love]], the cause through which i bleed, 
let aura never to my bed succeed. 
i then perceiv'd the error of our [[fate]], 
and told it her, but found and told too late! 
i [[felt]] her lower to my bosom fall, 
and while her [[eyes]] had any sight at all, 
on mine she fix'd them; in her pangs still prest 
my hand, and sigh'd her [[soul]] into my breast; 
yet, being undeceiv'd, resign'd her breath 
methought more chearfully, and smil'd in [[death]]. 

with such concern the weeping heroe told 
this tale, that none who heard him cou'd with-hold 
from melting into sympathizing tears, 
'till aeacus with his two sons [[son]] appears; 
whom he commits, with their new-levy'd bands, 
to fortune's, and so brave a gen'ral's hands.

book the eighth

the story of nisus and scylla 

now shone the morning star in bright array, 
to vanquish night, and usher in the day: 
the wind veers southward, and moist clouds arise, 
that blot with shades the blue meridian skies [[sky]]. 
cephalus feels [[feel]] with joy the kindly gales, 
his new allies unfurl the swelling sails; 
steady their course, they cleave the yielding main, 
and, with a [[wish]], th' intended harbour gain. 
mean-while [[king]] minos, on the attick strand, 
displays his martial [[skill]], and wastes the [[land]]. 
his [[army]] lies [[lie]] encampt upon the plains, 
before alcathoe's walls, where nisus reigns; 
on whose grey head a lock of purple hue, 
the [[strength]], and [[fortune]] of his [[kingdom]], grew. 

six moons were gone, and [[past]], when still from far 
victoria hover'd o'er the doubtful [[war]]. 
so long, to both inclin'd, th' [[impartial]] maid 
between 'em both her [[equal]] wings display'd. 
high on the walls, by phoebus vocal made, 
a turret of the palace rais'd its head; 
and where the [[god]] his tuneful harp resign'd. 
the sound within the stones still lay enshrin'd: 
hither the [[daughter]] of the purple [[king]] 
ascended oft, to hear its musick ring; 
and, striking with a pebble, wou'd release 
th' enchanted notes, in times [[time]] of [[happy]] [[peace]]. 
but now, from thence, the [[curious]] maid beheld 
rough feats of arms, and combats of the field: 
and, since the siege was long, had learnt the name 
of ev'ry [[chief]], his [[character]], and fame; 
their arms, their horse, and quiver she descry'd, 
nor cou'd the dress of [[war]] the warriour hide. 

europa's [[son]] she knew above the rest, 
and more, than well became a virgin breast: 
in [[vain]] the crested morion veils his face, 
she thinks [[think]] it adds a more peculiar grace: 
his ample shield, embost with burnish'd gold, 
still makes the bearer lovelier to behold: 
when the tough jav'lin, with a whirl, he sends, 
his [[strength]] and [[skill]] the sighing maid commends; 
or, when he strains to draw the circling bow, 
and his fine limbs a manly posture show, 
compar'd with phoebus, he performs so well, 
let her be [[judge]], and minos shall excell. 

but when the helm put off, display'd to sight, 
and set his features in an open [[light]]; 
when, vaulting to his seat, his steed he prest, 
caparison'd in gold, and richly drest; 
himself in scarlet sumptuously array'd, 
new [[passions]] rise, and [[fire]] the frantick maid. 
o [[happy]] spear! she cries, that feels [[feel]] his touch; 
nay, ev'n the reins he holds are blest too much. 
oh! were it lawful, she cou'd wing her way 
thro' the stern hostile [[troops]] without dismay; 
or throw her [[body]] to the distant ground, 
and in the cretans [[happy]] camp be found. 
wou'd minos but [[desire]] it! she'd expose 
her native [[country]] to her country's foes; 
unbar the gates, the town with flames infest, 
or any thing that minos shou'd request. 

and as she sate, and pleas'd her longing sight, 
viewing the king's pavilion veil'd with [[white]], 
shou'd joy, or [[grief]], she said, possess my breast, 
to see my [[country]] by a [[war]] opprest? 
i'm in suspense! for, tho' 'tis [[grief]] to [[know]] 
i [[love]] a [[man]] that is declar'd my foe; 
yet, in my own despite, i must approve 
that lucky [[war]], which brought the [[man]] i [[love]]. 
yet, were i tender'd as a pledge of [[peace]], 
the cruelties of [[war]] might quickly cease. 
oh! with what joy i'd wear the chains he gave! 
a patient hostage, and a willing [[slave]]. 
thou lovely object! if the [[nymph]] that bare 
thy charming [[person]], were but half so [[fair]]; 
well might a [[god]] her virgin bloom [[desire]], 
and with a rape indulge his amorous [[fire]]. 
oh! had i wings to glide along the air, 
to his dear tent i'd fly, and settle there: 
there tell my quality, confess my flame, 
and grant him any dowry that he'd name. 
all, all i'd give; only my native [[land]], 
my dearest [[country]], shou'd excepted stand, 
for, perish [[love]], and all expected joys, 
e're, with so base a [[thought]], my [[soul]] complies. 
yet, oft the vanquish'd some advantage find, 
when conquer'd by a [[noble]], gen'rous [[mind]]. 
brave minos justly has the [[war]] begun, 
fir'd with resentment for his murder'd [[son]]: 
the righteous gods a righteous cause regard, 
and will, with [[victory]], his arms [[reward]]: 
we must be conquer'd; and the captive's [[fate]] 
will surely seize us, tho' it seize us late. 
why then shou'd [[love]] be idle, and neglect 
what [[mars]], by arms and perils, will effect? 
oh! [[prince]], i dye, with anxious [[fear]] opprest, 
lest some rash hand shou'd wound my charmer's breast: 
for, if they saw, no barb'rous [[mind]] cou'd dare 
against that lovely form to raise a spear. 

but i'm resolv'd, and fix'd in this decree, 
my father's [[country]] shall my dowry be. 
thus i prevent the loss of [[life]] and [[blood]], 
and, in effect, the action must be [[good]]. 
vain resolution! for, at ev'ry gate 
the trusty centinels, successive, wait: 
the keys my [[father]] keeps; ah! there's my [[grief]]; 
'tis he obstructs all hopes [[hope]] of my relief. 
gods! that this hated [[light]] i'd never seen! 
or, all my [[life]], without a [[father]] been! 
but gods we all may be; for those that dare, 
are gods, and fortune's chiefest favours share. 
the ruling pow'rs a lazy pray'r detest, 
the bold adventurer succeeds the [[best]]. 
what other maid, inspir'd with such a flame, 
but wou'd take [[courage]], and abandon shame? 
but wou'd, tho' ruin shou'd ensue, remove 
whate'er oppos'd, and clear the way to [[love]]? 
this, shall another's feeble passion dare? 
while i sit tame, and languish in despair: 
no; for tho' [[fire]] and [[sword]] before me lay, 
impatient [[love]] thro' both shou'd [[force]] its way. 
yet i have no such enemies [[enemy]] to [[fear]], 
my sole obstruction is my father's hair; 
his purple lock my sanguine [[hope]] destroys, 
and clouds the prospect of my rising joys. 

whilst thus she spoke, amid the thick'ning air 
night supervenes, the [[greatest]] nurse of [[care]]: 
and, as the [[goddess]] spreads her sable wings, 
the virgin's fears [[fear]] decay, and [[courage]] springs. 
the hour was come, when man's [[man]] o'er-labour'd breast 
surceas'd its [[care]], by downy sleep possest: 
all things now hush'd, scylla with silent tread 
urg'd her approach to nisus' [[royal]] bed: 
there, of the fatal lock (accursed theft!) 
she her unwitting father's head bereft. 
in safe possession of her impious prey, 
out at a postern gate she takes her way. 
embolden'd, by the [[merit]] of the deed 
she traverses the adverse camp with speed, 
'till minos' tent she reach'd: the righteous [[king]] 
she thus bespoke, who shiver'd at the thing. 

behold th' effect of love's resistless sway! 
i, nisus' [[royal]] seed, to thee betray 
my [[country]], and my gods. for this [[strange]] task, 
minos, no other boon but thee i ask. 
this purple lock, a pledge of [[love]], receive; 
no worthless [[present]], since in it i give 
my father's head.- mov'd at a crime so new, 
and with abhorrence fill'd, back minos drew, 
nor touch'd th' unhallow'd gift; but thus exclaim'd 
(with mein indignant, and with [[eyes]] inflam'd), 
perdition seize thee, thou, thy kind's disgrace! 
may thy devoted carcass find no place 
in [[earth]], or air, or sea, by all out-cast! 
shall minos, with so foul a monster, blast 
his cretan [[world]], where cradled jove was nurst? 
forbid it heav'n!- away, thou most accurst! 

and now alcathoe, its [[lord]] exchang'd, 
was under minos' domination rang'd. 
while the most [[equal]] [[king]] his [[care]] applies 
to curb the conquer'd, and new laws [[law]] devise, 
the fleet, by his command, with hoisted sails, 
and ready oars, invites the murm'ring gales. 
at length the cretan hero anchor weigh'd, 
repaying, with neglect, th' abandon'd maid. 
deaf to her cries, he furrows up the main: 
in [[vain]] she prays, sollicits him in [[vain]]. 

and now she furious grows in wild despair, 
she wrings her hands, and throws aloft her hair. 
where run'st thou? (thus she vents her deep distress) 
why shun'st thou her that crown'd thee with [[success]]? 
her, whose fond [[love]] to thee cou'd [[sacrifice]] 
her [[country]], and her parent, [[sacred]] ties! 
can nor my [[love]], nor proffer'd presents [[present]] find 
a passage to thy [[heart]], and make thee [[kind]]? 
can nothing move thy [[pity]]? o ingrate, 
can'st thou behold my lost, forlorn estate, 
and not be soften'd? can'st thou throw off one 
who has no refuge left but thee alone? 
where shall i seek for comfort? whither fly? 
my native [[country]] does in ashes lye: 
or were't not so, my [[treason]] bars me there, 
and bids me wander. shall i next repair 
to a wrong'd [[father]], by my guilt undone?- 
me all [[mankind]] deservedly will shun. 
i, out of all the [[world]], my [[self]] have thrown, 
to purchase an access to crete alone; 
which, since refus'd, ungen'rous [[man]], give o'er 
to boast thy [[race]]; europa never bore 
a thing so savage. thee some tygress bred, 
on the bleak syrt's inhospitable bed; 
or where charybdis pours its rapid tide 
tempestuous. thou art [[arts]] not to jove ally'd; 
nor did the [[king]] of gods thy [[mother]] meet 
beneath a bull's forg'd shape, and bear to crete. 
that fable of thy glorious birth is feign'd; 
some wild outrageous bull thy dam sustain'd. 
o [[father]] nisus, now my [[death]] behold; 
exult, o [[city]], by my baseness sold: 
minos, obdurate, has aveng'd ye all; 
but 'twere more just by those i wrong'd to fall: 
for why shou'dst thou, who only didst subdue 
by my offending, my offence pursue? 
well art [[arts]] thou matcht to one whose am'rous flame 
too fiercely rag'd, for human-kind to tame; 
one who, within a wooden heifer thrust, 
courted a low'ring bull's mistaken [[lust]]; 
and, from whose monster-teeming womb, the [[earth]] 
receiv'd, what much it mourn'd, a bi-form birth. 
but what avails my plaints? the whistling wind, 
which bears him far away, leaves them behind. 
well weigh'd pasiphae, when she prefer'd 
a bull to thee, more brutish than the herd. 
but ah! [[time]] presses, and the labour'd oars 
to distance drive the fleet, and lose the less'ning shores.

think not, ungrateful [[man]], the liquid way 
and threat'ning billows shall inforce my stay. 
i'll [[follow]] thee in spite: my arms i'll throw 
around thy oars, or grasp thy crooked prow, 
and drag thro' drenching seas. her eager tongue 
had hardly clos'd the [[speech]], when forth she sprung 
and prov'd the deep. cupid with added [[force]] 
recruits each nerve, and aids her wat'ry course. 
soon she the ship attains, unwelcome guest; 
and, as with close embrace its sides she prest, 
a hawk from upper air came pouring down 
('twas nisus cleft the [[sky]] with wings new grown). 
at scylla's head his horny bill he aims; 
she, fearful of the blow, the ship disclaims, 
quitting her hold: and yet she fell not far, 
but wond'ring, finds her [[self]] sustain'd in air. 
chang'd to a lark, she mottled pinions shook, 
and, from the ravish'd lock, the name of ciris took. 

the labyrinth 

now minos, landed on the cretan shore, 
performs his vows to jove's protecting pow'r; 
a hundred bullocks of the largest breed, 
with flowrets crown'd, before his altar bleed: 
while trophies of the vanquish'd, brought from far 
adorn the palace with the spoils of [[war]]. 

mean-while the monster of a human-beast, 
his family's reproach, and stain, increas'd. 
his double [[kind]] the rumour swiftly spread, 
and evidenc'd the mother's beastly deed. 
when minos, willing to conceal the shame 
that sprung from the reports of tatling fame, 
resolves a dark inclosure to provide, 
and, far from sight, the two-form'd creature hide. 

great daedalus of [[athens]] was the [[man]] 
that made the draught, and form'd the wondrous plan; 
where rooms within themselves encircled lye, 
with various windings, to [[deceive]] the eye. 
as soft maeander's wanton current plays, 
when thro' the phrygian fields it loosely strays; 
backward and forward rouls the dimpl'd tide, 
seeming, at once, two different ways to glide: 
while circling streams their former banks survey, 
and waters [[past]] succeeding waters see: 
now floating to the sea with downward course, 
now pointing upward to its ancient source, 
such was the [[work]], so intricate the place, 
that scarce the workman all its turns cou'd trace; 
and daedalus was puzzled how to find 
the secret ways of what himself design'd. 

these private walls the minotaur include, 
who twice was glutted with athenian [[blood]]: 
but the third tribute more successful prov'd, 
slew the foul monster, and the plague remov'd. 
when theseus, aided by the virgin's art [[arts]], 
had trac'd the guiding thread thro' ev'ry part, 
he took the gentle maid, that set him [[free]], 
and, bound for dias, cut the briny sea. 
there, quickly cloy'd, ungrateful, and unkind, 
left his [[fair]] consort in the isle behind, 
whom bacchus saw, and straining in his arms 
her rifled bloom, and violated charms, 
resolves, for this, the dear engaging dame 
shou'd shine for ever in the rolls of fame; 
and bids her [[crown]] among the stars be plac'd, 
with an eternal constellation grac'd. 
the golden circlet mounts; and, as it flies, 
its diamonds twinkle in the distant skies [[sky]]; 
there, in their pristin form, the gemmy rays 
between alcides, and the dragon blaze. 

the story of daedalus and icarus 

in tedious [[exile]] now too long detain'd, 
daedalus languish'd for his native [[land]]: 
the sea foreclos'd his flight; yet thus he said: 
tho' [[earth]] and water in subjection laid, 
o cruel minos, thy dominion be, 
we'll go thro' air; for sure the air is [[free]]. 
then to new [[arts]] his cunning [[thought]] applies, 
and to improve the [[work]] of [[nature]] tries. 
a row of quils in gradual order plac'd, 
rise by degrees [[degree]] in length from first to [[last]]; 
as on a cliff th' ascending thicket grows, 
or, different reeds the rural pipe compose. 
along the middle runs a twine of flax, 
the bottom stems are joyn'd by pliant wax. 
thus, well compact, a hollow bending brings 
the fine composure into real wings. 

his boy, [[young]] icarus, that near him stood, 
unthinking of his [[fate]], with smiles pursu'd 
the floating feathers, which the moving air 
bore loosely from the ground, and wasted here and there.

or with the wax impertinently play'd, 
and with his childish tricks the [[great]] design delay'd. 

the final master-stroke at [[last]] impos'd, 
and now, the neat machine compleatly clos'd; 
fitting his pinions on, a flight he tries, 
and hung self-ballanc'd in the beaten skies [[sky]]. 
then thus instructs his child: my boy, take [[care]] 
to wing your course along the middle air; 
if low, the surges wet your flagging plumes; 
if high, the sun the melting wax consumes: 
steer between both: nor to the northern skies [[sky]], 
nor south orion turn your giddy [[eyes]]; 
but [[follow]] me: let me before you lay 
rules for the flight, and mark the pathless way. 
then teaching, with a fond concern, his [[son]], 
he took the untry'd wings, and fix'd 'em on; 
but fix'd with trembling hands; and as he speaks, 
the tears roul gently down his aged cheeks. 
then kiss'd, and in his arms embrac'd him fast, 
but knew not this embrace must be the [[last]]. 
and mounting upward, as he wings his flight, 
back on his charge he turns his aking sight; 
as parent birds, when first their callow [[care]] 
leave the high nest to tempt the liquid air. 
then chears him on, and oft, with fatal art [[arts]], 
reminds the stripling to perform his part. 

these, as the angler at the silent brook, 
or mountain-shepherd leaning on his crook, 
or gaping plowman, from the vale descries, 
they stare, and view 'em with [[religious]] [[eyes]], 
and strait conclude 'em gods; since none, but they, 
thro' their own azure skies [[sky]] cou'd find a way. 

now delos, paros on the left are seen, 
and samos, favour'd by jove's haughty queen; 
upon the [[right]], the isle lebynthos nam'd, 
and [[fair]] calymne for its honey fam'd. 
when now the boy, whose childish thoughts [[thought]] aspire 
to loftier aims, and make him ramble high'r, 
grown wild, and wanton, more embolden'd flies 
far from his guide, and soars among the skies [[sky]]. 
the soft'ning wax, that [[felt]] a nearer sun, 
dissolv'd apace, and soon began to run. 
the [[youth]] in [[vain]] his melting pinions shakes, 
his feathers gone, no longer air he takes: 
oh! [[father]], [[father]], as he strove to cry, 
down to the sea he tumbled from on high, 
and found his [[fate]]; yet still subsists by fame, 
among those waters that retain his name. 

the [[father]], now no more a [[father]], cries, 
ho icarus! where are you? as he flies; 
where shall i seek my boy? he cries again, 
and saw his feathers scatter'd on the main. 
then curs'd his art [[arts]]; and fun'ral rites confer'd, 
naming the [[country]] from the [[youth]] interr'd. 

a partridge, from a neighb'ring stump, beheld 
the sire his monumental marble build; 
who, with peculiar call, and flutt'ring wing, 
chirpt joyful, and malicious seem'd to sing: 
the only bird of all its [[kind]], and late 
transform'd in [[pity]] to a feather'd [[state]]: 
from whence, o daedalus, thy guilt we date. 

his sister's [[son]], when now twelve years were [[past]], 
was, with his uncle, as a scholar plac'd; 
the unsuspecting [[mother]] saw his parts, 
and genius fitted for the finest [[arts]]. 
this soon appear'd; for when the spiny bone 
in fishes' backs was by the stripling known, 
a rare invention thence he learnt to draw, 
fil'd teeth in ir'n, and made the grating saw. 
he was the first, that from a knob of brass 
made two strait arms with widening stretch to pass; 
that, while one stood upon the center's place, 
the other round it drew a circling space. 
daedalus envy'd this, and from the top 
of [[fair]] minerva's temple let him drop; 
feigning, that, as he lean'd upon the tow'r, 
careless he stoop'd too much, and tumbled o'er. 

the [[goddess]], who th' ingenious still befriends, 
on this [[occasion]] her asssistance lends; 
his arms with feathers, as he fell, she veils, 
and in the air a new made bird he sails. 
the quickness of his genius, once so fleet, 
still in his wings remains, and in his feet: 
still, tho' transform'd, his ancient name he keeps, 
and with low flight the new-shorn stubble sweeps, 
declines the lofty trees, and thinks [[think]] it [[best]] 
to brood in hedge-rows o'er its humble nest; 
and, in remembrance of the former ill, 
avoids the heights, and precipices still. 

at length, fatigu'd with long laborious flights, 
on [[fair]] sicilia's plains the artist lights [[light]]; 
where cocalus the [[king]], that gave him aid, 
was, for his [[kindness]], with esteem repaid. 
athens no more her doleful tribute sent, 
that hardship gallant theseus did prevent; 
their temples hung with garlands, they adore 
each friendly [[god]], but most minerva's pow'r: 
to her, to jove, to all, their altars smoak, 
they each with victims, and perfumes invoke. 

now talking fame, thro' every grecian town, 
had spread, [[immortal]] theseus, thy renown. 
from him the neighb'ring nations in distress, 
in suppliant terms implore a [[kind]] redress. 

the story of meleager and atalanta 

from him the caledonians sought relief; 
though valiant meleagros was their [[chief]]. 
the cause, a boar, who ravag'd far and near: 
of cynthia's wrath, th' avenging minister. 
for oeneus with autumnal plenty bless'd, 
by gifts to heav'n his gratitude express'd: 
cull'd sheafs, to ceres; to lyaeus, wine; 
to pan, and pales, offer'd sheep and kine; 
and fat of olives, to minerva's shrine. 
beginning from the rural gods, his hand 
was lib'ral to the pow'rs of high command: 
each deity in ev'ry [[kind]] was bless'd, 
'till at diana's fane th' invidious [[honour]] ceas'd. 

wrath touches ev'n the gods; the queen of night, 
fir'd with disdain, and [[jealous]] of her [[right]], 
unhonour'd though i am, at least, said she, 
not unreveng'd that impious act shall be. 
swift as the word, she sped the boar away, 
with charge on those devoted fields to prey. 
no larger bulls th' aegyptian pastures feed, 
and none so large sicilian meadows breed: 
his eye-balls glare with [[fire]] suffus'd with [[blood]]; 
his neck shoots up a thick-set thorny wood; 
his bristled back a trench impal'd appears, 
and stands erected, like a field of spears; 
froth fills his chaps, he sends a grunting sound, 
and part he churns, and part befoams the ground, 
for tusks with [[indian]] elephants he strove, 
and jove's own thunder from his mouth he drove. 
he burns the leaves; the scorching blast invades 
the tender corn, and shrivels up the blades: 
or suff'ring not their yellow beards to rear, 
he tramples down the spikes, and intercepts the year: 
in [[vain]] the barns expect their promis'd load, 
nor barns at [[home]], nor recks are heap'd abroad: 
in [[vain]] the hinds the threshing-floor prepare, 
and exercise their flail in empty air. 
with olives ever-green the ground is strow'd, 
and grapes ungather'd shed their gen'rous [[blood]]. 
amid the fold he rages, nor the sheep 
their shepherds, nor the grooms their bulls can keep. 

from fields to walls the frighted rabble run, 
nor [[think]] themselves secure within the town: 
'till meleagros, and his chosen crew, 
contemn the danger, and the [[praise]] pursue. 
fair leda's twins (in [[time]] to stars decreed) 
one fought on foot, one curb'd the fiery steed; 
then issu'd forth fam'd jason after these, 
who mann'd the foremost ship that sail'd the seas; 
then theseus join'd with bold perithous came; 
a [[single]] concord in a double name: 
the thestian sons [[son]], idas who swiftly ran, 
and ceneus, once a woman, now a [[man]]. 
lynceus, with eagle's [[eyes]], and lion's [[heart]]; 
leucippus, with his never-erring dart; 
acastus, phileus, phoenix, telamon, 
echion, lelix, and eurytion, 
achilles' [[father]], and [[great]] phocus' [[son]]; 
dryas the fierce, and hippasus the [[strong]]; 
with twice old iolas, and nestor then but [[young]]. 
laertes active, and ancaeus bold; 
mopsus the sage, who future things foretold; 
and t' other seer, yet by his [[wife]] unsold. 
a thousand others of [[immortal]] fame; 
among the rest, [[fair]] atalanta came, 
grace of the woods: a diamond buckle bound 
her vest behind, that else had flow'd upon the ground, 
and shew'd her buskin'd legs; her head was bare, 
but for her native ornament of hair; 
which in a simple knot was ty'd above, 
sweet negligence! unheeded bait of love! 
her sounding quiver, on her shoulder ty'd, 
one hand a dart, and one a bow supply'd. 
such was her face, as in a [[nymph]] display'd 
a [[fair]] fierce boy, or in a boy betray'd 
the blushing beauties [[beauty]] of a modest maid. 
the caledonian [[chief]] at once the dame 
beheld, at once his [[heart]] receiv'd the flame, 
with heav'ns averse. o [[happy]] [[youth]], he cry'd; 
for whom thy fates [[fate]] reserve so [[fair]] a bride! 
he sigh'd, and had no leisure more to say; 
his [[honour]] call'd his [[eyes]] another way, 
and forc'd him to pursue the now-neglected prey. 

there stood a forest on a mountain's brow, 
which over-look'd the shaded plains below. 
no sounding ax presum'd those trees to bite; 
coeval with the [[world]], a venerable sight. 
the heroes there arriv'd, some spread around 
the toils; some search the footsteps on the ground: 
some from the chains the faithful dogs unbound. 
of action eager, and intent in [[thought]], 
the chiefs [[chief]] their honourable danger sought: 
a valley stood below; the [[common]] drain 
of waters from above, and falling rain: 
the bottom was a moist, and marshy ground, 
whose edges were with bending oziers crown'd: 
the knotty bulrush next in order stood, 
and all within of reeds a trembling wood. 

from hence the boar was rous'd, and sprung amain, 
like lightning sudden, on the warrior train; 
beats down the trees before him, shakes the ground. 
the forest echoes to the crackling sound; 
shout the fierce [[youth]], and clamours ring around. 
all stood with their protended spears prepar'd, 
with broad steel heads the brandish'd [[weapons]] glar'd. 
the beast impetuous with his tusks aside 
deals glancing wounds; the fearful dogs divide: 
all spend their mouths aloof, but none abide. 
echion threw the first, but miss'd his mark, 
and stuck his boar-spear on a maple's bark. 
then jason; and his javelin seem'd to take, 
but fail'd with over-force, and whiz'd above his back. 
mopsus was next; but e'er he threw, address'd 
to phoebus, thus: o patron, [[help]] thy [[priest]]: 
if i adore, and ever have ador'd 
thy pow'r [[divine]], thy [[present]] aid afford; 
that i may reach the beast. the [[god]] allow'd 
his pray'r, and smiling, gave him what he cou'd: 
he reach'd the savage, but no [[blood]] he drew: 
dian unarm'd the javelin, as it flew. 

this chaf'd the boar, his nostrils flames expire, 
and his red eye-balls roul with living [[fire]]. 
whirl'd from a sling, or from an engine thrown, 
amid the foes, so flies a mighty stone, 
as flew the beast: the left wing put to flight, 
the chiefs [[chief]] o'er-born, he rushes on the [[right]]. 
eupalamos and pelagon he laid 
in dust, and next to [[death]], but for their fellows' aid. 
onesimus far'd worse, prepar'd to fly, 
the fatal fang drove deep within his thigh, 
and cut the nerves: the nerves no more sustain 
the bulk; the bulk unprop'd, falls headlong on the plain.

nestor had fail'd the fall of troy to see, 
but leaning on his lance, he vaulted on a tree; 
then gath'ring up his feet, look'd down with [[fear]], 
and [[thought]] his monstrous foe was still too near. 
against a stump his tusk the monster grinds, 
and in the sharpen'd edge new vigour finds; 
then, trusting to his arms, [[young]] othrys found, 
and ranch'd his hips with one continu'd wound. 

now leda's twins, the future stars, appear; 
white were their habits, [[white]] their horses were: 
conspicuous both, and both in act to throw, 
their trembling lances brandish'd at the foe: 
nor had they miss'd; but he to thickets fled, 
conceal'd from aiming spears, not pervious to the steed.

but telamon rush'd in, and happ'd to meet 
a rising root, that held his fastned feet; 
so down he fell, whom, sprawling on the ground, 
his [[brother]] from the wooden gyves unbound. 

mean-time the virgin-huntress was not slow 
t' expel the shaft from her contracted bow: 
beneath his ear the fastned arrow stood, 
and from the wound appear'd the trickling [[blood]]. 
she blush'd for joy: but meleagros rais'd 
his voice with loud applause, and the [[fair]] archer prais'd.

he was the first to see, and first to show 
his [[friends]] the marks of the successful blow. 
nor shall thy valour want the praises [[praise]] due, 
he said; a [[virtuous]] envy seiz'd the crew. 
they shout; the shouting animates their hearts [[heart]], 
and all at once employ their thronging darts: 
but out of order thrown, in air they joyn, 
and multitude makes frustrate the design. 
with both his hands the proud ancaeus takes, 
and flourishes his double-biting ax: 
then, forward to his [[fate]], he took a stride 
before the rest, and to his fellows cry'd, 
give place, and mark the diff'rence, if you can, 
between a woman warrior, and a [[man]], 
the boar is doom'd; nor though diana lend 
her aid, diana can her beast defend. 
thus boasted he; then stretch'd, on tiptoe stood, 
secure to make his empty promise [[good]]. 
but the more wary beast prevents the blow, 
and upward rips the groin of his audacious foe. 
ancaeus falls; his bowels from the wound 
rush out, and clotted [[blood]] distains the ground. 

perithous, no small portion of the [[war]], 
press'd on, and shook his lance: to whom from far 
thus theseus cry'd; o stay, my [[better]] part, 
my more than mistress; of my [[heart]], the [[heart]]. 
the [[strong]] may [[fight]] aloof; ancaeus try'd 
his [[force]] too near, and by presuming dy'd: 
he said, and while he spake his javelin threw, 
hissing in air th' unerring weapon flew; 
but on an arm of oak, that stood betwixt 
the marks-man and the mark, his lance he fixt. 

once more bold jason threw, but fail'd to wound 
the boar, and slew an undeserving hound, 
and thro' the dog the dart was nail'd to ground. 

two spears from meleager's hand were sent, 
with [[equal]] [[force]], but various in th' event: 
the first was fix'd in [[earth]], the second stood 
on the boar's bristled back, and deeply drank his [[blood]].

now while the tortur'd savage turns around, 
and flings about his foam, impatient of the wound, 
the wound's [[great]] author close at hand provokes 
his rage, and plies him with redoubled strokes; 
wheels, as he wheels; and with his pointed dart 
explores the nearest passage to his [[heart]]. 
quick, and more quick he spins in giddy gires, 
then falls, and in much foam his [[soul]] expires. 
this act with shouts heav'n-high the friendly band 
applaud, and strain in theirs the victor's hand. 
then all approach the slain with vast surprize, 
admire on what a breadth of [[earth]] he lies [[lie]], 
and scarce secure, reach out their spears afar, 
and [[blood]] their points, to prove their partnership of [[war]].

but he, the conqu'ring [[chief]], his foot impress'd 
on the [[strong]] neck of that destructive beast; 
and gazing on the [[nymph]] with ardent [[eyes]], 
accept, said he, [[fair]] nonacrine, my prize, 
and, though inferior, suffer me to join 
my labours [[labour]], and my part of [[praise]], with thine: 
at this presents [[present]] her with the tusky head 
and chine, with rising bristles roughly spread. 
glad she receiv'd the gift; and seem'd to take 
with double [[pleasure]], for the giver's sake. 
the rest were seiz'd with sullen discontent, 
and a deaf murmur through the squadron went: 
all envy'd; but the thestyan brethren [[brother]] show'd 
the least [[respect]], and thus they vent their spleen aloud:

lay down those honour'd spoils, nor [[think]] to share, 
weak woman as thou art [[arts]], the prize of [[war]]: 
ours is the title, thine a [[foreign]] claim, 
since meleagrus from our lineage came. 
trust not thy [[beauty]]; but restore the prize, 
which he, besotted on that face, and [[eyes]], 
would rend from us: at this, enflam'd with spite, 
from her they snatch the gift, from him the giver's [[right]].

but soon th' impatient [[prince]] his fauchion drew, 
and cry'd, ye robbers of another's due, 
now learn the diff'rence, at your proper cost, 
betwixt true valour, and an empty boast. 
at this advanc'd, and sudden as the word, 
in proud plexippus' bosom plung'd the [[sword]]: 
toxeus amaz'd, and with amazement slow, 
or to [[revenge]], or ward the coming blow, 
stood doubting; and while doubting thus he stood, 
receiv'd the steel bath'd in his brother's [[blood]]. 

pleas'd with the first, unknown the second news; 
althaea to the temples pays [[pay]] their dues 
for her son's [[conquest]]; when at length appear 
her grisly brethren [[brother]] stretch'd upon the bier: 
pale at the sudden sight, she chang'd her cheer, 
and with her cheer her robes; but hearing tell 
the cause, the manner, and by whom they fell, 
'twas [[grief]] no more, or [[grief]] and rage were one 
within her [[soul]]; at [[last]] 'twas rage alone; 
which burning upwards in succession, dries 
the tears, that stood consid'ring in her [[eyes]]. 

there lay a log unlighted on the hearth, 
when she was lab'ring in the throws of birth 
for th' unborn [[chief]]; the fatal sisters came, 
and rais'd it up, and toss'd it on the flame: 
then on the rock a scanty measure place 
of vital flax, and turn'd the wheel apace; 
and turning sung, to this red brand and thee, 
o new born babe, we give an [[equal]] [[destiny]]; 
so vanish'd out of view. the frighted dame 
sprung hasty from her bed, and quench'd the flame: 
the log, in secret lock'd, she kept with [[care]], 
and that, while thus preserv'd, preserv'd her heir. 
this brand she now produc'd; and first she strows 
the hearth with heaps of chips, and after blows; 
thrice heav'd her hand, and heav'd, she thrice repress'd:

the sister and the [[mother]] long contest, 
two doubtful titles, in one tender breast: 
and now her [[eyes]], and cheeks with fury glow, 
now pale her cheeks, her [[eyes]] with [[pity]] flow: 
now low'ring looks presage approaching storms, 
and now prevailing [[love]] her face reforms: 
resolv'd, she doubts [[doubt]] again; the tears she dry'd 
with burning rage, are by new tears supply'd; 
and as a ship, which winds and waves assail 
now with the current drives, now with the gale, 
both opposite, and neither long prevail: 
she feels [[feel]] a double [[force]], by turns obeys 
th' imperious tempest, and th' impetuous seas: 
so fares althaea's [[mind]], she first relents 
with [[pity]], of that [[pity]] then repents: 
sister, and [[mother]] long the scales divide, 
but the beam nodded on the sister's side. 
sometimes she softly sigh'd, then roar'd aloud; 
but sighs were stifled in the cries of [[blood]]. 

the pious, impious wretch at length decreed, 
to please her brothers' ghost, her [[son]] should bleed: 
and when the fun'ral flames began to rise, 
receive, she said, a sister's [[sacrifice]]; 
a mother's bowels burn: high in her hand, 
thus while she spoke, she held the fatal brand; 
then thrice before the kindled pile she bow'd, 
and the three furies thrice invok'd aloud: 
come, come, revenging sisters, come, and view 
a sister paying her [[dead]] brothers [[brother]] due: 
a crime i punish, and a crime commit; 
but [[blood]] for [[blood]], and [[death]] for [[death]] is fit: 
great crimes must be with greater crimes repaid, 
and second fun'rals on the former laid. 
let the whole houshold in one ruin fall, 
and may diana's curse o'ertake us all. 
shall [[fate]] to [[happy]] oenus still allow 
one [[son]], while thestius stands depriv'd of two? 
better three lost, than one unpunish'd go. 
take then, dear ghosts (while yet admitted new 
in hell you wait my duty), take your due: 
a costly off'ring on your tomb is laid, 
when with my [[blood]] the price of yours is paid. 

ah! whither am i hurry'd? ah! [[forgive]], 
ye shades, and let your sister's issue [[live]]; 
a [[mother]] cannot give him [[death]]; tho' he 
deserves it, he deserves it not from me. 

then shall th' unpunish'd wretch insult the slain, 
triumphant [[live]], nor only [[live]], but reign? 
while you, thin shades, the [[sport]] of winds, are tost 
o'er dreary plains, or tread the burning coast. 
i cannot, cannot bear; 'tis [[past]], 'tis done; 
perish this impious, this detested [[son]]: 
perish his sire, and perish i withal; 
and let the house's heir, and the hop'd [[kingdom]] fall. 

where is the [[mother]] fled, her pious [[love]], 
and where the pains [[pain]] with which ten months i strove! 
ah! had'st thou dy'd, my [[son]], in infant years, 
thy little herse had been bedew'd with tears. 

thou liv'st by me; to me thy breath resign; 
mine is the [[merit]], the demerit thine. 
thy [[life]] by double title i require; 
once giv'n at birth, and once preserv'd from [[fire]]: 
one murder [[pay]], or add one murder more, 
and me to them who fell by thee restore. 

i would, but cannot: my son's image stands 
before my sight; and now their angry hands 
my brothers [[brother]] hold, and vengeance these exact; 
this pleads compassion, and repents the [[fact]]. 

he pleads in [[vain]], and i pronounce his doom: 
my brothers [[brother]], though unjustly, shall o'ercome. 
but having paid their injur'd ghosts their due, 
my [[son]] requires my [[death]], and mine shall his pursue. 

at this, for the [[last]] [[time]], she lifts her hand, 
averts her [[eyes]], and, half unwilling, drops the brand. 
the brand, amid the flaming fewel thrown, 
or drew, or seem'd to draw, a dying groan; 
the fires [[fire]] themselves but faintly lick'd their prey, 
then loath'd their impious food, and would have shrunk away.

just then the heroe cast a doleful cry, 
and in those absent flames began to fry: 
the blind contagion rag'd within his veins; 
but he with manly patience bore his pains [[pain]]: 
he fear'd not [[fate]], but only griev'd to [[die]] 
without an honest wound, and by a [[death]] so dry. 
happy ancaeus, thrice aloud he cry'd, 
with what becoming [[fate]] in arms he dy'd! 
then call'd his brothers [[brother]], sisters, sire around, 
and, her to whom his nuptial vows were bound, 
perhaps his [[mother]]; a long sigh she drew, 
and his voice failing, took his [[last]] adieu. 
for as the flames augment, and as they stay 
at their full height, then languish to decay, 
they rise and sink by fits; at [[last]] they soar 
in one bright blaze, and then descend no more: 
just so his inward heats, at height, impair, 
'till the [[last]] burning breath shoots out the [[soul]] in air.

now lofty calidon in ruins lies [[lie]]; 
all ages [[age]], all degrees [[degree]] unsluice their [[eyes]], 
and heav'n, and [[earth]] resound with murmurs, groans, and cries.

matrons and maidens beat their breasts, and tear 
their habits, and root up their scatter'd hair: 
the wretched [[father]], [[father]] now no more, 
with [[sorrow]] sunk, lies [[lie]] prostrate on the floor, 
deforms his hoary locks with dust obscene, 
and curses [[age]], and loaths a [[life]] prolong'd with [[pain]]. 
by steel her stubborn [[soul]] his [[mother]] freed, 
and punish'd on her [[self]] her impious deed. 

had i a hundred tongues, a wit so large 
as could their hundred offices discharge; 
had phoebus all his helicon bestow'd 
in all the streams, inspiring all the [[god]]; 
those tongues, that wit, those streams, that [[god]] in vain

would offer to describe his sisters' [[pain]]: 
they beat their breasts with many a bruizing blow, 
'till they turn livid, and [[corrupt]] the snow. 
the corps they cherish, while the corps remains, 
and exercise, and rub with fruitless pains [[pain]]; 
and when to fun'ral flames 'tis born away, 
they kiss the bed on which the [[body]] lay: 
and when those fun'ral flames no longer burn 
(the dust compos'd within a pious urn), 
ev'n in that urn their [[brother]] they confess, 
and hug it in their arms, and to their bosoms press. 

his tomb is rais'd; then, stretch'd along the ground, 
those living monuments his tomb surround: 
ev'n to his name, inscrib'd, their tears they [[pay]], 
'till tears, and kisses wear his name away. 

but cynthia now had all her fury spent, 
not with less ruin than a [[race]] content: 
excepting gorge, perish'd all the seed, 
and her whom heav'n for hercules decreed. 
satiate at [[last]], no longer she pursu'd 
the weeping sisters; but with wings endu'd, 
and horny beaks, and sent to flit in air; 
who yearly round the tomb in feather'd flocks repair. 

the transformation of the naiads 

theseus mean-while acquitting well his share 
in the bold chace confed'rate like a [[war]], 
to athens' lofty tow'rs his march ordain'd, 
by pallas lov'd, and where erectheus reign'd. 
but achelous stop'd him on the way, 
by rains a deluge, and constrain'd his stay. 

o fam'd for glorious deeds, and [[great]] by [[blood]], 
rest here, says he, nor trust the rapid flood; 
it solid oaks has from its margin tore, 
and rocky fragments down its current bore, 
the murmur hoarse, and terrible the roar. 
oft have i seen herds with their shelt'ring fold 
forc'd from the banks, and in the torrent roul'd; 
nor [[strength]] the bulky steer from ruin freed, 
nor matchless swiftness sav'd the racing steed. 
in cataracts when the dissolving snow 
falls from the hills, and floods the plains below; 
toss'd by the eddies with a giddy round, 
strong youths [[youth]] are in the sucking whirlpools drown'd. 
'tis [[best]] with me in safety to abide, 
'till usual bounds restrain the ebbing tide, 
and the low waters in their channel glide. 

theseus perswaded, in compliance bow'd: 
so [[kind]] an offer, and [[advice]] so [[good]], 
o achelous, cannot be refus'd; 
i'll use them both, said he; and both he us'd. 

the grot he enter'd, pumice built the hall, 
and tophi made the rustick of the wall; 
the floor, soft moss, an humid carpet spread, 
and various shells the chequer'd roof inlaid. 
'twas now the hour when the declining sun 
two thirds had of his daily [[journey]] run; 
at the spread table theseus took his place, 
next his companions in the daring chace; 
perithous here, there elder lelex lay, 
his locks betraying [[age]] with sprinkled grey. 
acharnia's river-god dispos'd the rest, 
grac'd with the [[equal]] [[honour]] of the feast, 
elate with joy, and proud of such a guest. 
the nymphs [[nymph]] were waiters, and with naked feet 
in order serv'd the courses of the meat. 
the banquet done, delicious wine they brought, 
of one transparent gem the cup was wrought. 

then the [[great]] heroe of this gallant train, 
surveying far the prospect of the main: 
what is that [[land]], says he, the waves embrace? 
(and with his finger pointed at the place); 
is it one parted isle which stands alone? 
how nam'd? and yet methinks it seems not one. 
to whom the watry [[god]] made this reply; 
'tis not one isle, but five; distinct they lye; 
'tis distance which deceives the cheated eye. 
but that diana's act may seem less [[strange]], 
these once proud naiads were, before their [[change]]. 
'twas on a day more solemn than the rest, 
ten bullocks slain, a sacrificial feast: 
the rural gods of all the region near 
they bid to dance, and taste the hallow'd cheer. 
me they forgot: affronted with the slight, 
my rage, and stream swell'd to the [[greatest]] height; 
and with the torrent of my flooding store, 
large woods from woods, and fields from fields i tore. 
the guilty nymphs [[nymph]], oh! then, remembring me, 
i, with their [[country]], wash'd into the sea; 
and joining waters with the social main, 
rent the gross [[land]], and split the firm champagne. 
since, the echinades, remote from shore 
are view'd as many isles, as nymphs [[nymph]] before. 

perimele turn'd into an island 

but yonder far, lo, yonder does appear 
an isle, a part to me for ever dear. 
from that (it sailors perimele name) 
i doating, forc'd by rape a virgin's fame. 
hippodamas's passion grew so [[strong]], 
gall'd with th' [[abuse]], and fretted at the [[wrong]], 
he cast his pregnant [[daughter]] from a rock; 
i spread my waves beneath, and broke the shock; 
and as her swimming weight my stream convey'd, 
i su'd for [[help]] [[divine]], and thus i pray'd: 
o pow'rful thou, whose trident does command 
the realm of waters, which surround the [[land]]; 
we [[sacred]] rivers, wheresoe'er begun, 
end in thy lot, and to thy [[empire]] run. 
with favour hear, and [[help]] with [[present]] aid; 
her whom i bear 'twas guilty i betray'd. 
yet if her [[father]] had been just, or mild, 
he would have been less impious to his child; 
in her, have pity'd [[force]] in the [[abuse]]; 
in me, admitted [[love]] for my excuse. 
o let relief for her hard case be found, 
her, whom paternal rage expell'd from ground, 
her, whom paternal rage relentless drown'd. 
grant her some place, or [[change]] her to a place, 
which i may ever clasp with my embrace. 

his nodding head the sea's [[great]] ruler bent, 
and all his waters shook with his assent. 
the [[nymph]] still swam, tho' with the fright distrest, 
i [[felt]] her [[heart]] leap trembling in her breast; 
but hardning soon, whilst i her pulse explore, 
a crusting [[earth]] cas'd her stiff [[body]] o'er; 
and as accretions of new-cleaving soil 
inlarg'd the mass, the [[nymph]] became an isle. 

the story of baucis and philemon 

thus achelous ends: his audience hear 
with admiration, and admiring, [[fear]] 
the pow'rs of heav'n; except ixion's [[son]], 
who laugh'd at all the gods, believ'd in none: 
he shook his impious head, and thus replies. 
these legends are no more than pious lies [[lie]]: 
you attribute too much to heav'nly sway, 
to [[think]] they give us forms, and take away. 

the rest of [[better]] minds [[mind]], their sense declar'd 
against this doctrine, and with [[horror]] heard. 
then lelex rose, an old experienc'd [[man]], 
and thus with sober gravity began; 
heav'n's pow'r is infinite: [[earth]], air, and sea, 
the manufacture mass, the making pow'r obey: 
by proof to clear your [[doubt]]; in phrygian ground 
two neighb'ring trees, with walls encompass'd round, 
stand on a mod'rate rise, with wonder shown, 
one a hard oak, a softer linden one: 
i saw the place, and them, by pittheus sent 
to phrygian realms, my grandsire's [[government]]. 
not far from thence is seen a lake, the haunt 
of coots, and of the fishing cormorant: 
here jove with hermes came; but in [[disguise]] 
of mortal [[men]] conceal'd their deities; 
one laid aside his thunder, one his rod; 
and many toilsome steps together trod: 
for harbour at a thousand doors they knock'd, 
not one of all the thousand but was lock'd. 
at [[last]] an hospitable house they found, 
a homely shed; the roof, not far from ground, 
was thatch'd with reeds, and straw, together bound. 
there baucis and philemon liv'd, and there 
had liv'd long marry'd, and a [[happy]] pair: 
now old in [[love]], though little was their store, 
inur'd to want, their [[poverty]] they bore, 
nor aim'd at [[wealth]], professing to be [[poor]]. 
for master, or for servant here to call, 
was all alike, where only two were all. 
command was none, where [[equal]] [[love]] was paid, 
or rather both commanded, both obey'd. 

from lofty roofs the gods repuls'd before, 
now stooping, enter'd through the little door: 
the [[man]] (their hearty welcome first express'd) 
a [[common]] settle drew for either guest, 
inviting each his weary limbs to rest. 
but ere they sate, officious baucis lays 
two cushions stuff'd with straw, the seat to raise; 
coarse, but the [[best]] she had; then rakes the load 
of ashes from the hearth, and spreads abroad 
the living coals; and, lest they should expire, 
with leaves, and bark she feeds her infant [[fire]]: 
it smoaks; and then with trembling breath she blows, 
'till in a chearful blaze the flames arose. 
with brush-wood, and with chips she strengthens these, 
and adds at [[last]] the boughs of rotten trees. 
the [[fire]] thus form'd, she sets the kettle on 
(like burnish'd gold the little seether shone), 
next took the coleworts which her husband got 
from his own ground (a small well-water'd spot); 
she stripp'd the stalks of all their leaves; the [[best]] 
she cull'd, and them with handy [[care]] she drest. 
high o'er the hearth a chine of bacon hung; 
good old philemon seiz'd it with a prong, 
and from the sooty rafter drew it down, 
then cut a slice, but scarce enough for one; 
yet a large portion of a little store, 
which for their sakes alone he wish'd were more. 
this in the pot he plung'd without delay, 
to tame the flesh, and drain the salt away. 
the [[time]] beween, before the [[fire]] they sat, 
and shorten'd the delay by pleasing chat. 

a beam there was, on which a beechen pail 
hung by the handle, on a driven nail: 
this fill'd with water, gently warm'd, they set 
before their guests; in this they bath'd their feet, 
and after with clean towels dry'd their sweat. 
this done, the host produc'd the genial bed, 
sallow the feet, the borders, and the sted, 
which with no costly coverlet they spread, 
but coarse old garments; yet such robes as these 
they laid alone, at feasts, on holidays. 
the [[good]] old housewife, tucking up her gown, 
the table sets; th' invited gods [[lie]] down. 
the trivet-table of a foot was lame, 
a blot which prudent baucis overcame, 
who thrusts beneath the limping leg a sherd, 
so was the mended board exactly rear'd: 
then rubb'd it o'er with newly gather'd mint, 
a wholsom herb, that breath'd a grateful scent. 
pallas began the feast, where first was seen 
the party-colour'd olive, black, and green: 
autumnal cornels next in order serv'd, 
in lees of wine well pickled, and preserv'd. 
a garden-sallad was the third supply, 
of endive, radishes, and succory: 
then curds, and cream, the flow'r of [[country]] fare, 
and new-laid eggs, which baucis' busie [[care]] 
turn'd by a gentle [[fire]], and roasted rare. 
all these in earthen ware were serv'd to board; 
and next in place, an earthen pitcher stor'd, 
with liquor of the [[best]] the cottage could afford. 
this was the table's ornament and [[pride]], 
with figures wrought: like pages at his side 
stood beechen bowls; and these were shining clean, 
varnish'd with wax without, and lin'd within. 
by this the boiling kettle had prepar'd, 
and to the table sent the smoaking lard; 
on which with eager appetite they dine, 
a sav'ry bit, that serv'd to relish wine: 
the wine itself was suiting to the rest, 
still working in the must, and lately press'd. 
the second course succeeds like that before, 
plums, apples, nuts, and of their wintry store 
dry figs, and grapes, and wrinkled dates were set 
in canisters, t' enlarge the little treat: 
all these a milk-white honey-comb surround, 
which in the midst the country-banquet crown'd: 
but the [[kind]] hosts their entertainment grace 
with hearty welcome, and an open face: 
in all they did, you might discern with ease, 
a willing [[mind]], and a [[desire]] to please. 

mean-time the beechen bowls went round, and still, 
though often empty'd, were observ'd to fill; 
fill'd without hands, and of their own accord 
ran without feet, and danc'd about the board. 
devotion seiz'd the pair, to see the feast 
with wine, and of no [[common]] grape, increas'd; 
and up they held their hands, and fell to pray'r, 
excusing, as they could, their [[country]] fare. 

one goose they had ('twas all they could allow), 
a wakeful centry, and on [[duty]] now, 
whom to the gods for [[sacrifice]] they vow: 
her with malicious zeal the couple view'd; 
she ran for [[life]], and limping they pursu'd: 
full well the fowl perceiv'd their [[bad]] intent, 
and would not make her master's compliment; 
but persecuted, to the pow'rs she flies, 
and close between the legs of jove she lies [[lie]]: 
he with a gracious ear the suppliant heard, 
and sav'd her [[life]]; then what he has declar'd, 
and own'd the [[god]]. the neighbourhood, said he, 
shall justly perish for impiety: 
you stand alone exempted; but obey 
with speed, and [[follow]] where we lead the way: 
leave these accurs'd; and to the mountain's height 
ascend; nor once look backward in your flight. 

they haste, and what their tardy feet deny'd, 
the trusty staff (their [[better]] leg) supply'd. 
an arrow's flight they wanted to the top, 
and there secure, but spent with travel, stop; 
then turn their now no more forbidden [[eyes]]; 
lost in a lake the floated level lies [[lie]]: 
a watry desart covers all the plains, 
their cot alone, as in an isle, remains. 
wondring, with weeping [[eyes]], while they deplore 
their neighbours' [[fate]], and [[country]] now no more, 
their little shed, scarce large enough for two, 
seems, from the ground increas'd, in height and bulk to grow.

a stately temple shoots within the skies [[sky]], 
the crotches of their cot in columns rise: 
the pavement polish'd marble they behold, 
the gates with sculpture grac'd, the spires and tiles of gold.

then thus the sire of gods, with looks serene, 
speak thy [[desire]], thou only just of [[men]]; 
and thou, o woman, only worthy found 
to be with such a [[man]] in [[marriage]] bound. 

a-while they whisper; then, to jove address'd, 
philemon thus prefers their joint request: 
we crave to serve before your [[sacred]] shrine, 
and offer at your altars rites [[divine]]: 
and since not any action of our [[life]] 
has been polluted with domestick strife; 
we beg one hour of [[death]], that neither she 
with widow's tears may [[live]] to bury me, 
nor weeping i, with wither'd arms may bear 
my breathless baucis to the sepulcher. 

the godheads sign their suit. they run their [[race]] 
in the same tenour all th' appointed space: 
then, when their hour was come, while they relate 
these [[past]] adventures at the temple gate, 
old baucis is by old philemon seen 
sprouting with sudden leaves of spritely green: 
old baucis look'd where old philemon stood, 
and saw his lengthen'd arms a sprouting wood: 
new roots their fasten'd feet begin to bind, 
their bodies [[body]] stiffen in a rising rind: 
then, ere the bark above their shoulders grew, 
they give, and take at once their [[last]] adieu. 
at once, farewell, o faithful spouse, they said; 
at once th' incroaching rinds their closing lips invade.

ev'n yet, an ancient tyanaean shows 
a spreading oak, that near a linden grows; 
the neighbourhood confirm the prodigy, 
grave [[men]], not [[vain]] of tongue, or like to [[lie]]. 
i saw my [[self]] the garlands on their boughs, 
and tablets hung for gifts of granted vows; 
and off'ring fresher up, with pious pray'r, 
the [[good]], said i, are god's peculiar [[care]], 
and such as [[honour]] heav'n, shall heav'nly [[honour]] share. 

the changes [[change]] of proteus 

he ceas'd in his relation to proceed, 
whilst all admir'd the author, and the deed; 
but theseus most, inquisitive to [[know]] 
from gods what wondrous alterations grow. 
whom thus the calydonian stream address'd, 
rais'd high to speak, the couch his elbow press'd. 
some, when transform'd, fix in the lasting [[change]]; 
some with more [[right]], thro' various figures range. 
proteus, thus large thy [[privilege]] was found, 
thou inmate of the seas, which [[earth]] surround. 
sometimes a bloming [[youth]] you grac'd the shore; 
oft a fierce lion, or a furious boar: 
with glist'ning spires now seem'd an hissing snake, 
the bold would tremble in his hands to take: 
with horns assum'd a bull; sometimes you prov'd 
a tree by roots, a stone by weight unmov'd: 
sometimes two wav'ring contraries became, 
flow'd down in water, or aspir'd in flame. 

the story of erisichthon 

in various shapes thus to [[deceive]] the [[eyes]], 
without a settled stint of her [[disguise]], 
rash erisichthon's [[daughter]] had the pow'r, 
and brought it to autolicus in dow'r. 
her atheist sire the slighted gods defy'd, 
and ritual honours [[honour]] to their shrines deny'd. 
as fame reports, his hand an ax sustain'd, 
which ceres' consecrated grove prophan'd; 
which durst the venerable gloom invade, 
and violate with [[light]] the awful shade. 
an ancient oak in the dark center stood, 
the covert's [[glory]], and itself a wood: 
garlands embrac'd its shaft, and from the boughs 
hung tablets, monuments of prosp'rous vows. 
in the cool dusk its unpierc'd verdure spread, 
the dryads oft their hallow'd dances [[led]]; 
and oft, when round their gaging arms they cast, 
full fifteen ells it measu'rd in the waste: 
its height all under standards did surpass, 
as they aspir'd above the humbler grass. 

these motives, which would gentler minds [[mind]] restrain, 
could not make triope's bold [[son]] abstain; 
he sternly charg'd his slaves [[slave]] with strict decree, 
to fell with gashing steel the [[sacred]] tree. 
but whilst they, lingring, his commands delay'd, 
he snatch'd an ax, and thus blaspheming said: 
was this no oak, nor ceres' favourite [[care]], 
but ceres' [[self]], this arm, unaw'd, shou'd dare 
its leafy honours [[honour]] in the dust to spread, 
and level with the [[earth]] its airy head. 
he spoke, and as he poiz'd a slanting stroak, 
sighs heav'd, and tremblings shook the frighted oak; 
its leaves look'd sickly, pale its acorns grew, 
and its long branches sweat a chilly dew. 
but when his impious hand a wound bestow'd, 
blood from the mangled bark in currents flow'd. 
when a devoted bull of mighty size, 
a sinning nation's grand atonement, dies; 
with such a plenty from the spouting veins, 
a crimson stream the turfy altars stains. 

the wonder all amaz'd; yet one more bold, 
the [[fact]] dissuading, strove his ax to hold. 
but the thessalian, obstinately bent, 
too proud to [[change]], too harden'd to repent, 
on his [[kind]] monitor, his [[eyes]], which burn'd 
with rage, and with his [[eyes]] his weapon turn'd; 
take the [[reward]], says he, of pious dread: 
then with a blow lopp'd off his parted head. 
no longer check'd, the wretch his crime pursu'd, 
doubled his strokes, and sacrilege renew'd; 
when from the groaning trunk a voice was heard, 
a dryad i, by ceres' [[love]] preferr'd, 
within the circle of this clasping rind 
coeval grew, and now in ruin join'd; 
but instant vengeance shall thy [[sin]] pursue, 
and [[death]] is chear'd with this prophetick view. 

at [[last]] the oak with cords enforc'd to bow, 
strain'd from the top, and sap'd with wounds below, 
the humbler wood, partaker of its [[fate]], 
crush'd with its fall, and shiver'd with its weight. 

the grove destroy'd, the sister dryads moan, 
griev'd at its loss, and frighted at their own. 
strait, suppliants for [[revenge]] to ceres go, 
in sable weeds, expressive of their woe. 

the beauteous [[goddess]] with a graceful air 
bow'd in [[consent]], and nodded to their pray'r. 
the awful motion shook the fruitful ground, 
and wav'd the fields with golden harvests crown'd. 
soon she contriv'd in her projecting [[mind]] 
a plague severe, and piteous in its [[kind]] 
(if plagues for crimes of such presumptuous height 
could [[pity]] in the softest breast create). 
with pinching want, and hunger's keenest smart, 
to tear his vitals, and corrode his [[heart]]. 
but since her near approach by fate's deny'd 
to famine, and broad climes their pow'rs divide, 
a [[nymph]], the mountain's ranger, she address'd, 
and thus resolv'd, her high commands express'd. 

the description of famine 

where frozen scythia's utmost bound is plac'd, 
a desart lies [[lie]], a melancholy waste: 
in yellow crops there [[nature]] never smil'd, 
no fruitful tree to shade the barren wild. 
there sluggish cold its icy station makes, 
there paleness, frights, and aguish trembling shakes, 
of pining famine this the fated seat, 
to whom my orders in these words repeat: 
bid her this miscreant with her sharpest pains [[pain]] 
chastise, and sheath herself into his veins; 
be unsubdu'd by plenty's baffled store, 
reject my [[empire]], and defeat my pow'r. 
and lest the distance, and the tedious way, 
should with the toil, and long fatigue dismay, 
ascend my chariot, and convey'd on high, 
guide the rein'd dragons thro' the parting [[sky]]. 

the [[nymph]], accepting of the granted carr, 
sprung to the seat, and posted thro' the air; 
nor stop'd 'till she to a bleak mountain came 
of wondrous height, and caucasus its name. 
there in a stony field the fiend she found, 
herbs gnawing, and roots scratching from the ground. 
her elfelock hair in matted tresses grew, 
sunk were her [[eyes]], and pale her ghastly hue, 
wan were her lips, and foul with clammy glew. 
her throat was furr'd, her guts appear'd within 
with snaky crawlings thro' her parchment skin. 
her jutting hips seem'd starting from their place, 
and for a belly was a belly's space, 
her dugs hung dangling from her craggy spine, 
loose to her breast, and fasten'd to her chine. 
her joints protuberant by leanness grown, 
consumption sunk the flesh, and rais'd the bone. 
her knees large orbits bunch'd to monstrous size, 
and ancles to undue proportion rise. 

this plague the [[nymph]], not daring to draw near, 
at distance hail'd, and greeted from afar. 
and tho' she told her charge without delay, 
tho' her arrival late, and short her stay, 
she [[felt]] keen famine, or she seem'd to [[feel]], 
invade her [[blood]], and on her vitals steal. 
she turn'd, from the infection to remove, 
and back to thessaly the serpents drove. 

the fiend obey'd the goddess' command 
(tho' their effects in opposition stand), 
she cut her way, supported by the wind, 
and reach'd the mansion by the [[nymph]] assign'd. 

'twas night, when entring erisichthon's room, 
dissolv'd in sleep, and thoughtless of his doom, 
she clasp'd his limbs, by impious [[labour]] tir'd, 
with battish wings, but her whole [[self]] inspir'd; 
breath'd on his throat and chest a tainting blast, 
and in his veins infus'd an endless fast. 

the task dispatch'd, away the fury flies 
from plenteous regions, and from rip'ning skies [[sky]]; 
to her old barren north she wings her speed, 
and cottages distress'd with pinching need. 

still slumbers erisichthon's senses drown, 
and sooth his fancy with their softest down. 
he dreams [[dream]] of viands delicate to [[eat]], 
and revels on imaginary meat, 
chaws with his working mouth, but chaws in [[vain]], 
and tires his grinding teeth with fruitless [[pain]]; 
deludes his throat with visionary fare, 
feasts on the wind, and banquets on the air. 

the morning came, the night, and slumbers [[past]], 
but still the furious pangs of [[hunger]] [[last]]; 
the cank'rous rage still gnaws with griping pains [[pain]], 
stings in his throat, and in his bowels reigns. 

strait he requires, impatient in demand, 
provisions from the air, the seas, the [[land]]. 
but tho' the [[land]], air, seas, provisions grant, 
starves at full tables, and complains of want. 
what to a [[people]] might in dole be paid, 
or victual cities [[city]] for a long blockade, 
could not one wolfish appetite asswage; 
for glutting nourishment increas'd its rage. 
as rivers pour'd from ev'ry distant shore, 
the sea insatiate drinks, and thirsts for more; 
or as the [[fire]], which all materials burns, 
and wasted forests into ashes turns, 
grows more voracious, as the more it preys, 
recruits dilate the flame, and spread the blaze: 
so impious erisichthon's [[hunger]] raves, 
receives refreshments, and refreshments craves. 
food raises a [[desire]] for food, and meat 
is but a new provocative to [[eat]]. 
he grows more empty, as the more supply'd, 
and endless cramming but extends the void. 

the transformations of erisichthon's [[daughter]] 

now riches [[rich]] hoarded by paternal [[care]] 
were sunk, the glutton swallowing up the heir. 
yet the devouring flame no stores abate, 
nor less his [[hunger]] grew with his estate. 
one [[daughter]] left, as left his keen [[desire]], 
a [[daughter]] worthy of a [[better]] sire: 
her too he sold, spent [[nature]] to sustain; 
she scorn'd a [[lord]] with generous disdain, 
and flying, spread her hand upon the main. 
then pray'd: grant, thou, i bondage may escape, 
and with my [[liberty]] [[reward]] thy rape; 
repay my virgin treasure with thy aid 
('twas [[neptune]] who deflower'd the beauteous maid). 

the [[god]] was mov'd, at what the [[fair]] had su'd, 
when she so lately by her master view'd 
in her known figure, on a sudden took 
a fisher's habit, and a manly look. 
to whom her owner hasted to enquire; 
o thou, said he, whose baits hide treach'rous wire; 
whose art [[arts]] can manage, and experienc'd [[skill]] 
the taper angle, and the bobbing quill, 
so may the sea be ruffled with no storm, 
but smooth with calms, as you the [[truth]] inform; 
so your deceit may no shy fishes [[feel]], 
'till struck, and fasten'd on the bearded steel. 
did not you standing view upon the strand, 
a wand'ring maid? i'm sure i saw her stand; 
her hair disorder'd, and her homely dress 
betray'd her want, and witness'd her distress. 

me heedless, she reply'd, whoe'er you are, 
excuse, attentive to another [[care]]. 
i settled on the deep my steady eye; 
fix'd on my float, and bent on my employ. 
and that you may not [[doubt]] what i impart, 
so may the ocean's [[god]] assist my art [[arts]], 
if on the beach since i my [[sport]] pursu'd, 
or [[man]], or woman but my [[self]] i view'd. 
back o'er the sands, deluded, he withdrew, 
whilst she for her old form put off her new. 

her sire her shifting pow'r to [[change]] perceiv'd; 
and various chapmen by her sale deceiv'd. 
a fowl with spangled plumes, a brinded steer, 
sometimes a crested mare, or antler'd deer: 
sold for a price, she parted, to maintain 
her starving parent with dishonest gain. 

at [[last]] all means, as all provisions, fail'd; 
for the disease by remedies prevail'd; 
his muscles with a furious bite he tore, 
gorg'd his own tatter'd flesh, and gulph'd his gore. 
wounds were his feast, his [[life]] to [[life]] a prey, 
supporting [[nature]] by its own decay. 

but [[foreign]] stories why shou'd i relate? 
i too my [[self]] can to new forms translate, 
tho' the variety's not unconfin'd, 
but fix'd, in number, and restrain'd in [[kind]]: 
for often i this [[present]] shape retain, 
oft curl a snake the volumes of my train. 
sometimes my [[strength]] into my horns transfer'd, 
a bull i march, the captain of the herd. 
but whilst i once those goring [[weapons]] wore, 
vast wresting [[force]] one from my forehead tore. 
lo, my maim'd brows the injury still own; 
he ceas'd; his words concluding with a groan. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book the ninth

the story of achelous and hercules 

theseus requests the [[god]] to tell his woes, 
whence his maim'd brow, and whence his groans arose 
whence thus the calydonian stream reply'd, 
with twining reeds his careless tresses ty'd: 
ungrateful is the tale; for who can bear, 
when conquer'd, to rehearse the shameful [[war]]? 
yet i'll the melancholy story trace; 
so [[great]] a conqu'ror softens the disgrace: 
nor was it still so mean the prize to yield, 
as [[great]], and glorious to dispute the field. 
perhaps you've heard of deianira's name, 
for all the [[country]] spoke her beauty's fame. 
long was the [[nymph]] by num'rous suitors woo'd, 
each with address his envy'd hopes [[hope]] pursu'd: 
i joyn'd the loving band; to gain the [[fair]], 
reveal'd my passion to her father's ear. 
their [[vain]] pretensions all the rest resign, 
alcides only strove to [[equal]] mine; 
he boasts his birth from jove, recounts his spoils, 
his step-dame's hate subdu'd, and finish'd toils. 

can mortals then (said i), with gods compare? 
behold a [[god]]; mine is the watry [[care]]: 
through your wide realms i take my mazy way, 
branch into streams, and o'er the region stray: 
no [[foreign]] guest your daughter's charms adores, 
but one who rises in your native shores. 
let not his [[punishment]] your [[pity]] move; 
is juno's hate an argument for [[love]]? 
though you your [[life]] from [[fair]] alcmena drew, 
jove's a feign'd [[father]], or by fraud a true. 
chuse then; confess thy mother's [[honour]] lost, 
or thy descent from jove no longer boast. 

while thus i spoke, he look'd with stern disdain, 
nor could the sallies of his wrath restrain, 
which thus break forth. this arm decides our [[right]]; 
vanquish in words, be mine the prize in [[fight]]. 

bold he rush'd on. my [[honour]] to maintain, 
i fling my verdant garments on the plain, 
my arms stretch forth, my pliant limbs prepare, 
and with bent hands expect the furious [[war]]. 
o'er my sleek skin now gather'd dust he throws, 
and yellow sand his mighty muscles strows. 
oft he my neck, and nimble legs assails, 
he seems to grasp me, but as often fails. 
each part he now invades with eager hand; 
safe in my bulk, immoveable i stand. 
so when loud storms break high, and foam and roar 
against some mole that stretches from the shore; 
the firm foundation lasting tempests braves, 
defies the warring winds, and driving waves. 

a-while we breathe, then forward rush amain, 
renew the combat, and our ground maintain; 
foot strove with foot, i prone extend my breast, 
hands [[war]] with hands, and forehead forehead prest. 
thus have i seen two furious bulls engage, 
inflam'd with [[equal]] [[love]], and [[equal]] rage; 
each claims the fairest heifer of the grove, 
and [[conquest]] only can decide their [[love]]: 
the trembling herds survey the [[fight]] from far, 
'till [[victory]] decides th' important [[war]]. 
three times [[time]] in [[vain]] he strove my joints to wrest, 
to [[force]] my hold, and throw me from his breast; 
the fourth he broke my gripe, that clasp'd him round, 
then with new [[force]] he stretch'd me on the ground; 
close to my back the mighty burthen clung, 
as if a mountain o'er my limbs were flung. 
believe my tale; nor do i, boastful, aim 
by feign'd narration to extol my fame. 
no sooner from his grasp i [[freedom]] get, 
unlock my arms, that flow'd with trickling sweat, 
but quick he seized me, and renew'd the strife, 
as my exhausted bosom pants for [[life]]: 
my neck he gripes, my knee to [[earth]] he strains; 
i fall, and bite the sand with shame, and pains [[pain]]. 

o'er-match'd in [[strength]], to wiles, and [[arts]] i take, 
and slip his hold, in form of speckled snake; 
who, when i wreath'd in spires my [[body]] round, 
or show'd my forky tongue with hissing sound, 
smiles at my threats: such foes my cradle knew, 
he cries, dire snakes my infant hand o'erthrew; 
a dragon's form might other conquests gain, 
to [[war]] with me you take that shape in [[vain]]. 
art thou proportion'd to the hydra's length, 
who by his wounds receiv'd augmented [[strength]]? 
he rais'd a hundred hissing heads in air; 
when one i lopt, up-sprung a dreadful pair. 
by his wounds fertile, and with slaughter [[strong]], 
singly i quell'd him, and stretch'd [[dead]] along. 
what canst thou do, a form precarious, prone, 
to rouse my rage with terrors not thy own? 
he said; and round my neck his hands he cast, 
and with his straining fingers wrung me fast; 
my throat he tortur'd, close as pincers clasp, 
in [[vain]] i strove to loose the forceful grasp. 

thus vanquish'd too, a third form still remains, 
chang'd to a bull, my lowing fills the plains. 
strait on the left his nervous arms were thrown 
upon my brindled neck, and tugg'd it down; 
then deep he struck my horn into the sand, 
and fell'd my bulk among the dusty [[land]]. 
nor yet his fury cool'd; 'twixt rage and scorn, 
from my maim'd front he tore the stubborn horn: 
this, heap'd with flow'rs, and fruits, the naiads bear, 
sacred to plenty, and the bounteous year. 

he spoke; when lo, a beauteous [[nymph]] appears, 
girt like diana's train, with flowing hairs; 
the horn she brings in which all autumn's stor'd, 
and ruddy apples for the second board. 

now morn begins to dawn, the sun's bright [[fire]] 
gilds the high mountains, and the youths [[youth]] retire; 
nor stay'd they, 'till the troubled stream subsides, 
and in its bounds with peaceful current glides. 
but achelous in his oozy bed 
deep hides his brow deform'd, and rustick head: 
no real wound the victor's triumph show'd, 
but his lost honours [[honour]] griev'd the watry [[god]]; 
yet ev'n that loss the willow's leaves o'erspread, 
and verdant reeds, in garlands, bind his head. 

the [[death]] of nessus the centaur 

this virgin too, thy [[love]], o nessus, found, 
to her alone you owe the fatal wound. 
as the [[strong]] [[son]] of jove his bride conveys, 
where his paternal lands [[land]] their bulwarks raise; 
where from her slopy urn, evenus pours 
her rapid current, swell'd by wintry show'rs, 
he came. the frequent eddies whirl'd the tide, 
and the deep rolling waves all pass deny'd. 
as for himself, he stood unmov'd by fears [[fear]], 
for now his bridal charge employ'd his cares [[care]], 
the strong-limb'd nessus thus officious cry'd 
(for he the shallows of the stream had try'd), 
swim thou, alcides, all thy [[strength]] prepare, 
on yonder bank i'll lodge thy nuptial [[care]]. 

th' aonian [[chief]] to nessus trusts his [[wife]], 
all pale, and trembling for her heroe's [[life]]: 
cloath'd as he stood in the fierce lion's hide, 
the laden quiver o'er his shoulder ty'd 
(for cross the stream his bow and club were cast), 
swift he plung'd in: these billows shall be [[past]], 
he said, nor sought where smoother waters glide, 
but stem'd the rapid dangers of the tide. 
the bank he reach'd; again the bow he bears; 
when, hark! his bride's known voice alarms his ears. 
nessus, to thee i call (aloud he cries) 
vain is thy trust in flight, be timely [[wise]]: 
thou monster double-shap'd, my [[right]] set [[free]]; 
if thou no rev'rence owe my fame and me, 
yet kindred should thy lawless [[lust]] deny; 
think not, perfidious wretch, from me to fly, 
tho' wing'd with horse's speed; wounds shall pursue; 
swift as his words the fatal arrow flew: 
the centaur's back admits the feather'd wood, 
and thro' his breast the barbed weapon stood; 
which when, in anguish, thro' the flesh he tore, 
from both the wounds gush'd forth the spumy gore 
mix'd with lernaean venom; this he took, 
nor dire [[revenge]] his dying breast forsook. 
his garment, in the reeking purple dy'd, 
to rouse love's passion, he presents [[present]] the bride. 

the [[death]] of hercules 

now a long interval of [[time]] succeeds, 
when the [[great]] [[son]] of jove's [[immortal]] deeds, 
and step-dame's hate, had fill'd earth's utmost round; 
he from oechalia, with new lawrels crown'd, 
in triumph was return'd. he rites prepares, 
and to the [[king]] of gods directs his pray'rs; 
when fame (who falshood cloaths in truth's [[disguise]], 
and swells her little bulk with growing lies) 
thy tender ear, o deianira, mov'd, 
that hercules the [[fair]] iole lov'd. 
her [[love]] believes [[belief]] the tale; the [[truth]] she fears [[fear]] 
of his new passion, and gives way to tears. 
the flowing tears diffus'd her wretched [[grief]], 
why seek i thus, from streaming [[eyes]], relief? 
she cries; indulge not thus these fruitless cares [[care]], 
the harlot will but triumph in thy tears: 
let something be resolv'd, while yet there's [[time]]; 
my bed not conscious of a rival's crime. 
in [[silence]] shall i mourn, or loud [[complain]]? 
shall i seek calydon, or here remain? 
what tho', ally'd to meleager's fame, 
i boast the honours [[honour]] of a sister's name? 
my wrongs [[wrong]], perhaps, now urge me to pursue 
some desp'rate deed, by which the [[world]] shall view 
how far [[revenge]], and woman's rage can rise, 
when weltring in her [[blood]] the harlot dies. 

thus various [[passions]] rul'd by turns her breast, 
she now resolves to send the fatal vest, 
dy'd with lernaean gore, whose pow'r might move 
his [[soul]] anew, and rouse declining [[love]]. 
nor knew she what her sudden rage bestows, 
when she to lychas trusts her future woes; 
with soft endearments she the boy commands, 
to bear the garment to her husband's hands. 

th' unwitting hero takes the gift in haste, 
and o'er his shoulders lerna's poison cast, 
as first the [[fire]] with frankincense he strows, 
and utters to the gods his holy vows; 
and on the marble altar's polish'd frame 
pours forth the grapy stream; the rising flame 
sudden dissolves the subtle pois'nous juice, 
which taints his [[blood]], and all his nerves bedews. 
with wonted fortitude he bore the smart, 
and not a groan confess'd his burning [[heart]]. 
at length his patience was subdu'd by [[pain]], 
he rends the [[sacred]] altar from the plain; 
oete's wide forests echo with his cries: 
now to rip off the deathful robe he tries. 
where-e'er he plucks the vest, the skin he tears, 
the mangled muscles, and huge bones he bares 
(a ghastful sight!), or raging with his [[pain]], 
to rend the sticking plague he tugs in [[vain]]. 

as the red iron hisses in the flood, 
so boils the venom in his curdling [[blood]]. 
now with the greedy flame his entrails glow, 
and livid sweats down all his [[body]] flow; 
the cracking nerves burnt up are burst in twain, 
the lurking venom melts his swimming brain. 

then, lifting both his hands aloft, he cries, 
glut thy [[revenge]], dread empress of the skies [[sky]]; 
sate with my [[death]] the rancour of thy [[heart]], 
look down with [[pleasure]], and enjoy my smart. 
or, if e'er [[pity]] mov'd a hostile breast 
(for here i stand thy [[enemy]] profest), 
take hence this hateful [[life]], with tortures torn, 
inur'd to trouble, and to labours [[labour]] born. 
death is the gift most welcome to my woe, 
and such a gift a stepdame may bestow. 
was it for this busiris was subdu'd, 
whose barb'rous temples reek'd with strangers' [[blood]]? 
press'd in these arms his [[fate]] antaeus found, 
nor gain'd recruited vigour from the ground. 
did i not triple-form'd geryon fell? 
or did i [[fear]] the triple dog of hell? 
did not these hands the bull's arm'd forehead hold? 
are not our mighty toils in elis told? 
do not stymphalian lakes proclaim thy fame? 
and [[fair]] parthenian woods resound thy name? 
who seiz'd the golden belt of thermodon? 
and who the dragon-guarded apples won? 
could the fierce centaur's [[strength]] my [[force]] withstand, 
or the fell boar that spoil'd th' arcadian [[land]]? 
did not these arms the hydra's rage subdue, 
who from his wounds to double fury grew? 
what if the thracian horses, fat with gore, 
who [[human]] bodies [[body]] in their mangers tore, 
i saw, and with their barb'rous [[lord]] o'erthrew? 
what if these hands nemaea's lion slew? 
did not this neck the heav'nly globe sustain? 
the female partner of the thunderer's reign 
fatigu'd, at length suspends her harsh commands, 
yet no fatigue hath slack'd these valiant hands. 
but now new plagues pursue me, neither [[force]], 
nor arms, nor darts can stop their raging course. 
devouring flame thro' my rack'd entrails strays, 
and on my lungs and shrivel'd muscles preys. 
yet still eurystheus breathes the vital air. 
what mortal now shall seek the gods with pray'r? 

the transformation of lychas into a rock 

the hero said; and with the torture stung, 
furious o'er oete's lofty hills he sprung. 
stuck with the shaft, thus scours the tyger round, 
and seeks the flying author of his wound. 
now might you see him trembling, now he vents 
his anguish'd [[soul]] in groans, and loud laments; 
he strives to tear the clinging vest in [[vain]], 
and with up-rooted forests strows the plain; 
now kindling into rage, his hands he rears, 
and to his kindred gods directs his pray'rs. 
when lychas, lo, he spies; who trembling flew, 
and in a hollow rock conceal'd from view, 
had shun'd his wrath. now [[grief]] renew'd his [[pain]], 
his madness chaf'd, and thus he raves again. 

lychas, to thee alone my [[fate]] i owe, 
who bore the gift, the cause of all my woe. 
the [[youth]] all pale, with shiv'ring [[fear]] was stung, 
and [[vain]] excuses falter'd on his tongue. 
alcides snatch'd him, as with suppliant face 
he strove to clasp his knees, and beg for grace: 
he toss'd him o'er his head with airy course, 
and hurl'd with more than with an engine's [[force]]; 
far o'er th' eubaean main aloof he flies, 
and hardens by degrees [[degree]] amid the skies [[sky]]. 
so showry drops, when chilly tempests blow, 
thicken at first, then whiten into snow, 
in balls congeal'd the rolling fleeces bound, 
in solid hail result upon the ground. 
thus, whirl'd with nervous [[force]] thro' distant air, 
the purple tide forsook his veins, with [[fear]]; 
all moisture left his limbs. transform'd to stone, 
in ancient days the craggy flint was known; 
still in the eubaean waves his front he rears, 
still the small rock in [[human]] form appears, 
and still the name of hapless lychas bears. 

the apotheosis of hercules 

but now the hero of [[immortal]] birth 
fells oete's forests on the groaning [[earth]]; 
a pile he builds; to philoctetes' [[care]] 
he leaves his deathful instruments of [[war]]; 
to him commits those arrows, which again 
shall see the bulwarks of the trojan reign. 
the [[son]] of paean lights [[light]] the lofty pyre, 
high round the structure climbs the greedy [[fire]]; 
plac'd on the top, thy nervous shoulders spread 
with the nemaean spoils, thy careless head 
rais'd on a knotty club, with look [[divine]], 
here thou, dread hero, of celestial line, 
wert stretch'd at ease; as when a chearful guest, 
wine crown'd thy bowls, and flow'rs thy temples drest. 

now on all sides the potent flames aspire, 
and crackle round those limbs that mock the [[fire]] 
a sudden terror seiz'd th' [[immortal]] host, 
who [[thought]] the world's profess'd defender lost. 
this when the thund'rer saw, with smiles he cries, 
'tis from your fears [[fear]], ye gods, my pleasures [[pleasure]] rise; 
joy swells my breast, that my all-ruling hand 
o'er such a grateful [[people]] boasts command, 
that you my suff'ring progeny would aid; 
tho' to his deeds this just [[respect]] be paid, 
me you've oblig'd. be all your fears [[fear]] forborn, 
th' oetean fires [[fire]] do thou, [[great]] hero, scorn. 
who vanquish'd all things, shall subdue the flame. 
that part alone of gross maternal frame 
fire shall devour; while what from me he drew 
shall [[live]] [[immortal]], and its [[force]] subdue; 
that, when he's [[dead]], i'll raise to realms above; 
may all the pow'rs the righteous act approve. 
if any [[god]] dissent, and [[judge]] too [[great]] 
the [[sacred]] honours [[honour]] of the heav'nly seat, 
ev'n he shall own his deeds deserve the [[sky]], 
ev'n he reluctant, shall at length comply. 
th' assembled pow'rs assent. no frown 'till now 
had mark'd with passion vengeful juno's brow, 
mean-while whate'er was in the pow'r of flame 
was all consum'd; his body's nervous frame 
no more was known, of [[human]] form bereft, 
th' eternal part of jove alone was left. 
as an old serpent casts his scaly vest, 
wreathes in the sun, in youthful [[glory]] drest; 
so when alcides mortal mold resign'd, 
his [[better]] part enlarg'd, and grew refin'd; 
august his visage shone; almighty jove 
in his swift carr his honour'd offspring drove; 
high o'er the hollow clouds the coursers fly, 
and lodge the hero in the starry [[sky]]. 

the transformation of galanthis 

atlas perceiv'd the load of heav'n's new guest. 
revenge still rancour'd in eurystheus' breast 
against alcides' [[race]]. alcmena goes 
to iole, to vent maternal woes; 
here she pours forth her [[grief]], recounts the spoils 
her [[son]] had bravely reap'd in glorious toils. 
this iole, by hercules' commands, 
hyllus had lov'd, and joyn'd in nuptial bands. 
her swelling womb the teeming birth confess'd, 
to whom alcmena thus her [[speech]] address'd. 

o, may the gods [[protect]] thee, in that hour, 
when, 'midst thy throws, thou call'st th' ilithyan pow'r!

may no delays prolong thy racking [[pain]], 
as when i su'd for juno's aid in [[vain]]. 

when now alcides' mighty birth drew nigh, 
and the tenth sign roll'd forward on the [[sky]], 
my womb extends with such a mighty load, 
as jove the parent of the burthen show'd. 
i could no more th' encreasing smart sustain, 
my [[horror]] kindles to recount the [[pain]]; 
cold chills my limbs while i the tale pursue, 
and now methinks i [[feel]] my pangs anew. 
seven days and nights amidst incessant throws, 
fatigu'd with ills i lay, nor knew repose; 
when lifting high my hands, in shrieks i pray'd, 
implor'd the gods, and call'd lucina's aid. 
she came, but prejudic'd, to give my [[fate]] 
a [[sacrifice]] to vengeful juno's hate. 
she hears the groaning anguish of my fits, 
and on the altar at my door she sits. 
o'er her left knee her crossing leg she cast, 
then knits her fingers close, and wrings them fast: 
this stay'd the birth; in mutt'ring verse she pray'd, 
the mutt'ring verse th' unfinish'd birth delay'd. 
now with fierce struggles, raging with my [[pain]], 
at jove's ingratitude i rave in [[vain]]. 
how did i [[wish]] for death! such groans i sent, 
as might have made the flinty [[heart]] relent. 

now the cadmeian matrons round me press, 
offer their vows, and seek to bring redress; 
among the theban dames galanthis stands, 
strong limb'd, red hair'd, and just to my commands: 
she first perceiv'd that all these racking woes 
from the persisting hate of juno rose. 
as here and there she pass'd, by [[chance]] she sees 
the seated [[goddess]]; on her close-press'd knees 
her fast-knit hands she leans; with chearful voice 
galanthis cries, whoe'er thou art [[arts]], rejoyce, 
congratulate the dame, she lies [[lie]] at rest, 
at length the gods alcmena's womb have blest. 
swift from her seat the startled [[goddess]] springs, 
no more conceal'd, her hands abroad she flings; 
the charm unloos'd, the birth my pangs reliev'd; 
galanthis' laughter vex'd the pow'r deceiv'd. 
fame says, the [[goddess]] dragg'd the laughing maid 
fast by the hair; in [[vain]] her [[force]] essay'd 
her grov'ling [[body]] from the ground to rear; 
chang'd to fore-feet her shrinking arms appear: 
her hairy back her former hue retains, 
the form alone is lost; her [[strength]] remains; 
who, since the lye did from her mouth proceed, 
shall from her pregnant mouth bring forth her breed; 
nor shall she quit her long-frequented [[home]], 
but haunt those houses where she lov'd to roam. 

the fable of dryope 

she said, and for her lost galanthis sighs; 
when the [[fair]] consort of her [[son]] replies; 
since you a servant's ravish'd form bemoan, 
and kindly sigh for sorrows [[sorrow]] not your own, 
let me (if tears and [[grief]] permit) relate 
a nearer woe, a sister's stranger [[fate]]. 

no [[nymph]] of all oechaloa could compare 
for beauteous form with dryope the [[fair]]; 
her tender mother's only [[hope]] and [[pride]] 
(my [[self]] the offspring of a second bride), 
this [[nymph]], compress'd by him who rules [[rule]] the day, 
whom delphi, and the delian isle obey, 
andraemon lov'd; and blest in all those charms 
that pleas'd a [[god]], succeeded to her arms. 

a lake there was, with shelving banks around, 
whose verdant summit fragrant myrtles crown'd. 
those shades, unknowing of the fates [[fate]], she sought; 
and to the naiads flow'ry garlands brought; 
her smiling babe (a pleasing charge) she prest 
between her arms, and nourish'd at her breast. 
not distant far a watry lotos grows; 
the spring was new, and all the verdant boughs, 
acorn'd with blossoms, promis'd fruits that vye 
in glowing colours with the tyrian dye. 
of these she cropt, to please her infant [[son]], 
and i my [[self]] the same rash act had done, 
but, lo! i saw (as near her side i stood) 
the violated blossoms drop with [[blood]]; 
upon the tree i cast a frightful look, 
the trembling tree with sudden [[horror]] shook. 
lotis the [[nymph]] (if rural tales be true) 
as from priapus' lawless [[lust]] she flew, 
forsook her form; and fixing here became 
a flow'ry plant, which still preserves her name. 

this [[change]] unknown, astonish'd at the sight, 
my trembling sister strove to urge her flight; 
yet first the pardon of the nymphs [[nymph]] implor'd, 
and those offended sylvan pow'rs ador'd: 
but when she backward would have fled, she found 
her stiff'ning feet were rooted to the ground: 
in [[vain]] to [[free]] her fasten'd feet she strove, 
and as she struggles only moves above; 
she feels [[feel]] th' incroaching bark around her grow, 
by slow degrees [[degree]], and cover all below: 
surpriz'd at this, her trembling hand she heaves 
to rend her hair; her hand is fill'd with leaves; 
where late was hair, the shooting leaves are seen 
to rise, and shade her with a sudden green. 
the child amphisus, to her bosom prest, 
perceiv'd a colder and a harder breast, 
and found the springs, that n'er 'till then deny'd 
their milky moisture, on a sudden dry'd. 
i saw, unhappy, what i now relate, 
and stood the helpless witness of thy [[fate]]; 
embrac'd thy boughs, the rising bark delay'd, 
there wish'd to grow, and mingle shade with shade. 

behold andraemon, and th' unhappy sire 
appear, and for their dryope enquire; 
a springing tree for dryope they find, 
and print warm kisses on the panting rind; 
prostrate, with tears their kindred plant bedew, 
and close embrac'd, as to the roots they grew; 
the face was all that now remain'd of thee; 
no more a woman, nor yet quite a tree: 
thy branches hung with humid pearls appear, 
from ev'ry leaf distills a trickling tear; 
and strait a voice, while yet a voice remains, 
thus thro' the trembling boughs in sighs complains. 

if to the wretched any [[faith]] be giv'n, 
i swear by all th' unpitying pow'rs of heav'n, 
no wilful crime this heavy vengeance bred, 
in mutual innocence our lives [[life]] we [[led]]. 
if this be false, let these new greens decay, 
let sounding axes lop my limbs away, 
and crackling flames on all my honours [[honour]] prey. 
now from my branching arms this infant bear, 
let some [[kind]] nurse supply a mother's [[care]]; 
yet to his [[mother]] let him oft be [[led]], 
sport in her shades, and in her shades be fed; 
teach him, when first his infant voice shall frame 
imperfect words, and lisp his mother's name, 
to hail this tree, and say with weeping [[eyes]], 
within this plant my hapless parent lies [[lie]]; 
and when in [[youth]] he seeks the shady woods, 
oh, let him fly the chrystal lakes and floods, 
nor touch the fatal flow'rs; but warn'd by me, 
believe a [[goddess]] shrin'd in ev'ry tree. 
my sire, my sister, and my spouse farewel! 
if in your breasts or [[love]], or [[pity]], dwell, 
protect your plant, nor let my branches [[feel]] 
the browzing cattle, or the piercing steel. 
farewel! and since i cannot bend to join 
my lips to yours, advance at least to mine. 
my [[son]], thy mother's parting kiss receive, 
while yet thy [[mother]] has a kiss to give. 
i can no more; the creeping rind invades 
my closing lips, and hides my head in shades: 
remove your hands; the bark shall soon suffice, 
without their aid, to seal these dying [[eyes]]. 
she ceas'd at once to speak, and ceas'd to be; 
and all the [[nymph]] was lost within the tree: 
yet latent [[life]] thro' her new branches reign'd, 
and long the plant a [[human]] heat retain'd. 

iolaus restor'd to [[youth]] 

while iole the fatal [[change]] declares, 
alcmena's pitying hand oft wip'd her tears. 
grief too stream'd down her cheeks; soon [[sorrow]] flies, 
and rising joy the trickling moisture dries, 
lo iolaus stands before their [[eyes]]. 
a [[youth]] he stood; and the soft down began 
o'er his smooth chin to spread, and promise [[man]]. 
hebe submitted to her husband's pray'rs, 
instill'd new vigour, and restor'd his years. 

the prophecy of themis 

now from her lips a solemn oath had [[past]], 
that iolaus this gift alone shou'd taste, 
had not just themis thus maturely said 
(which check'd her vow, and aw'd the blooming maid). 

thebes is embroil'd in [[war]]. capaneus stands 
invincible, but by the thund'rer's hands. 
ambition shall the guilty brothers [[brother]] [[fire]], 
both rush to mutual wounds, and both expire. 
the reeling [[earth]] shall ope her gloomy womb, 
where the yet breathing bard shall find his tomb. 
the [[son]] shall bath his hands in parents' [[blood]], 
and in one act be both [[unjust]], and [[good]]. 
of [[home]], and sense depriv'd, where-e'er he flies, 
the furies, and his mother's ghost he spies. 
his [[wife]] the fatal bracelet shall implore, 
and phegeus stain his [[sword]] in kindred gore. 
callirhoe shall then with suppliant pray'r 
prevail on jupiter's relenting ear. 
jove shall with [[youth]] her infant sons [[son]] inspire, 
and bid their bosoms glow with manly [[fire]]. 

the debate of the gods 

when themis thus with prescient voice had spoke, 
among the gods a various murmur broke; 
dissention rose in each [[immortal]] breast, 
that one should grant, what was deny'd the rest. 
aurora for her aged spouse complains, 
and ceres grieves for jason's freezing veins; 
vulcan would erichthonius' years renew, 
her future [[race]] the [[care]] of [[venus]] drew, 
she would anchises' blooming [[age]] restore; 
a diff'rent [[care]] employ'd each heav'nly pow'r: 
thus various int'rests did their jars encrease, 
'till jove arose; he spoke, their tumults cease. 

is any rev'rence to our presence giv'n, 
then why this discord 'mong the pow'rs of heav'n? 
who can the settled will of [[fate]] subdue? 
'twas by the fates [[fate]] that iolaus knew 
a second [[youth]]. the fates' determin'd doom 
shall give callirhoe's [[race]] a youthful bloom. 
arms, nor [[ambition]] can this pow'r obtain; 
quell your desires [[desire]]; ev'n me the fates [[fate]] restrain. 
could i their will controul, no rolling years 
had aeacus bent down with silver hairs; 
then rhadamanthus still had [[youth]] possess'd, 
and minos with eternal bloom been bless'd. 
jove's words the synod mov'd; the pow'rs give o'er, 
and urge in [[vain]] [[unjust]] complaint no more. 
since rhadamanthus' veins now slowly flow'd, 
and aeacus, and minos bore the load; 
minos, who in the flow'r of [[youth]], and fame, 
made mighty nations tremble at his name, 
infirm with [[age]], the proud miletus fears [[fear]], 
vain of his birth, and in the [[strength]] of years, 
and now regarding all his realms as lost, 
he durst not [[force]] him from his native coast. 
but you by [[choice]], miletus, fled his reign, 
and thy swift vessel plow'd th' aegean main; 
on asiatick shores a town you frame, 
which still is honour'd with the founder's name. 
here you cyanee knew, the beauteous maid, 
as on her father's winding banks she stray'd: 
caunus and byblis hence their lineage trace, 
the double offspring of your warm embrace. 

the passion of of byblis 

let the [[sad]] [[fate]] of wretched byblis prove 
a dismal warning to unlawful [[love]]; 
one birth gave being to the hapless pair, 
but more was caunus than a sister's [[care]]; 
unknown she lov'd, for yet the gentle [[fire]] 
rose not in flames, nor kindled to [[desire]], 
'twas [[thought]] no [[sin]] to wonder at his charms, 
hang on his neck, and languish in his arms; 
thus wing'd with joy, fled the soft hours away, 
and all the fatal guilt on harmless [[nature]] lay. 

but [[love]] (too soon from piety declin'd) 
insensibly deprav'd her yielding [[mind]]. 
dress'd she appears, with nicest art [[arts]] adorn'd, 
and ev'ry [[youth]], but her lov'd [[brother]], scorn'd; 
for him alone she labour'd to be [[fair]], 
and curst all charms that might with hers compare. 
'twas she, and only she, must caunus please, 
sick at her [[heart]], yet knew not her disease: 
she call'd him [[lord]], for [[brother]] was a name 
too cold, and dull for her aspiring flame; 
and when he spoke, if sister he reply'd, 
for byblis [[change]] that frozen word, she cry'd. 
yet waking still she watch'd her strugling breast, 
and love's approaches were in [[vain]] address'd, 
'till gentle sleep an easy [[conquest]] made, 
and in her soft embrace the conqueror was laid. 
but oh too soon the pleasing vision fled, 
and left her blushing on the conscious bed: 
ah me! (she cry'd) how monstrous do i seem? 
why these wild thoughts [[thought]]? and this incestuous [[dream]]? 
envy herself ('tis true) must own his charms, 
but what is [[beauty]] in a sister's arms? 
oh were i not that despicable she, 
how bless'd, how pleas'd, how [[happy]] shou'd i be! 
but unregarded now must bear my [[pain]], 
and but in dreams [[dream]], my wishes [[wish]] can obtain. 

o sea-born goddess! with thy wanton boy! 
was ever such a charming scene of joy? 
such [[perfect]] bliss! such ravishing delight! 
ne'er hid before in the [[kind]] shades of night. 
how pleas'd my heart! in what sweet raptures tost! 
ev'n [[life]] it [[self]] in the soft combat lost, 
while breathless he on my heav'd bosom lay, 
and snatch'd the treasures of my [[soul]] away. 

if the bare fancy so affects my [[mind]], 
how shou'd i rave if to the substance join'd? 
oh, gentle caunus! quit thy hated line, 
or let thy parents be no longer mine! 
oh that in [[common]] all things were enjoy'd, 
but those alone who have our hopes [[hope]] destroy'd. 
were i a princess, thou an humble swain, 
the proudest kings [[king]] shou'd rival thee in [[vain]]. 
it cannot be, alas! the dreadful ill 
is fix'd by [[fate]], and he's my [[brother]] still. 
hear me, ye gods! i must have [[friends]] in heav'n, 
for jove himself was to a sister giv'n: 
but what are their prerogatives above, 
to the short liberties [[liberty]] of [[human]] [[love]]? 
fantastick thoughts! down, down, forbidden fires [[fire]], 
or instant [[death]] extinguish my desires [[desire]]. 
strict [[virtue]], then, with thy malicious leave, 
without a crime i may a kiss receive: 
but say shou'd i in spight of laws [[law]] comply, 
yet cruel caunus might himself deny, 
no [[pity]] take of an afflicted maid 
(for love's sweet game must be by couples play'd). 
yet why shou'd [[youth]], and charms like mine, despair? 
such fears [[fear]] ne'er startled the aeolian pair; 
no ties of [[blood]] could their full hopes [[hope]] [[destroy]], 
they broke thro' all, for the prevailing joy; 
and who can tell but caunus too may be 
rack'd and tormented in his breast for me? 
like me, to the extreamest anguish drove, 
like me, just waking from a [[dream]] of [[love]]? 
but stay! oh whither wou'd my fury run! 
what arguments i urge to be undone! 
away fond byblis, quench these guilty flames; 
caunus thy [[love]] but as [[brother]] claims; 
yet had he first been touch'd with [[love]] of me, 
the charming [[youth]] cou'd i despairing see? 
oppress'd with [[grief]], and dying by disdain? 
ah no! too sure i shou'd have eas'd his pain! 
since then, if caunus ask'd me, it were done; 
asking my [[self]], what dangers can i run? 
but canst thou ask? and see that [[right]] betray'd, 
from pyrrha down to thy whole [[sex]] convey'd? 
that self-denying gift we all enjoy, 
of wishing to be won, yet seeming to be coy. 
well then, for once, let a fond mistress woo; 
the [[force]] of [[love]] no custom can subdue; 
this frantick passion he by words shall [[know]], 
soft as the melting [[heart]] from whence they flow. 
the pencil then in her [[fair]] hand she held, 
by [[fear]] discourag'd, but by [[love]] compell'd 
she writes, then blots, writes on, and blots again, 
likes it as fit, then razes it as [[vain]]: 
shame, and assurance in her face appear, 
and a faint [[hope]] just yielding to despair; 
sister was wrote, and blotted as a word 
which she, and caunus too (she hop'd) abhorr'd; 
but now resolv'd to be no more controul'd 
by scrup'lous [[virtue]], thus her [[grief]] she told. 

thy lover (gentle caunus) wishes [[wish]] thee 
that health, which thou alone canst give to me. 
o charming youth! the gift i ask bestow, 
ere thou the name of the fond writer [[know]]; 
to thee without a name i would be known, 
since knowing that, my frailty i must own. 
yet why shou'd i my wretched name conceal? 
when thousand instances my flames reveal: 
wan looks, and weeping [[eyes]] have spoke my [[pain]], 
and sighs discharg'd from my heav'd [[heart]] in [[vain]]; 
had i not wish'd my passion might be seen, 
what cou'd such fondness and embraces mean? 
such kisses too! (oh heedless lovely boy) 
without a crime no sister cou'd enjoy: 
yet (tho' extreamest rage has rack'd my [[soul]], 
and raging fires [[fire]] in my parch'd bosom roul) 
be witness, gods! how piously i strove, 
to rid my thoughts [[thought]] of this enchanting [[love]]. 
but who cou'd scape so fierce, and sure a dart, 
aim'd at a tender, and defenceless [[heart]]? 
alas! what maid cou'd suffer, i have born, 
ere the dire secret from my breast was torn; 
to thee a helpless vanquish'd wretch i come, 
'tis you alone can save, or give my doom; 
my [[life]], or [[death]] this moment you may chuse. 
yet [[think]], oh [[think]], no hated stranger sues, 
no foe; but one, alas! too near ally'd, 
and wishing still much nearer to be ty'd. 
the forms of decency let [[age]] debate, 
and virtue's rules [[rule]] by their cold morals [[moral]] [[state]]; 
their ebbing joys give leisure to enquire, 
and blame those [[noble]] flights our [[youth]] inspire: 
where [[nature]] kindly summons let us go, 
our sprightly years no bounds in [[love]] shou'd [[know]], 
shou'd [[feel]] no check of guilt, and [[fear]] no ill; 
lovers, and gods act all things at their will: 
we gain one blessing from our hated kin, 
since our paternal [[freedom]] hides the [[sin]]; 
uncensur'd in each other's arms we lye, 
think then how easie to compleat our joy. 
oh, pardon and oblige a blushing maid, 
whose rage the [[pride]] of her [[vain]] [[sex]] betray'd; 
nor let my tomb thus mournfully [[complain]], 
here byblis lies [[lie]], by her lov'd caunus slain. 

forc'd here to end, she with a falling tear 
temper'd the pliant wax, which did the signet bear: 
the [[curious]] cypher was impress'd by art [[arts]], 
but [[love]] had stamp'd one deeper in her [[heart]]; 
her page, a [[youth]] of confidence, and [[skill]], 
(secret as night) stood waiting on her will; 
sighing (she cry'd): bear this, thou faithful boy, 
to my sweet partner in eternal joy: 
here a long pause her secret guilt confess'd, 
and when at length she would have spoke the rest, 
half the dear name lay bury'd in her breast. 

thus as he listned to her [[vain]] command, 
down fell the letter from her trembling hand. 
the omen shock'd her [[soul]]. yet go, she cry'd; 
can a request from byblis be deny'd? 

to the maeandrian [[youth]] this message's born, 
the half-read lines by his fierce rage were torn; 
hence, hence, he cry'd, thou pandar to her [[lust]], 
bear hence the triumph of thy impious trust: 
thy instant [[death]] will but divulge her shame, 
or thy life's [[blood]] shou'd quench the guilty flame. 
frighted, from threatning caunus he withdrew, 
and with the dreadful news to his lost mistress flew. 
the [[sad]] repulse so struck the wounded [[fair]], 
her sense was bury'd in her wild despair; 
pale was her visage, as the ghastly [[dead]]; 
and her scar'd [[soul]] from the sweet mansion fled; 
yet with her [[life]] renew'd, her [[love]] returns, 
and faintly thus her cruel [[fate]] she mourns: 
'tis just, ye gods! was my false [[reason]] blind? 
to write a secret of this tender [[kind]]? 
with female craft i shou'd at first have strove, 
by dubious hints to sound his distant [[love]]; 
and try'd those useful, tho' dissembled, [[arts]], 
which [[women]] practise on disdainful hearts [[heart]]: 
i shou'd have watch'd whence the black storm might rise;

ere i had trusted the unfaithful skies [[sky]]. 
now on the rouling billows i am tost, 
and with extended sails, on the blind shelves am lost. 
did not indulgent heav'n my doom foretell, 
when from my hand the fatal letter fell? 
what madness seiz'd my [[soul]]? and urg'd me on 
to take the only course to be undone? 
i cou'd my [[self]] have told the moving tale 
with such alluring grace as must prevail; 
then had his [[eyes]] beheld my blushing fears [[fear]], 
my rising sighs, and my descending tears; 
round his dear neck these arms i then had spread, 
and, if rejected, at his feet been [[dead]]: 
if singly these had not his thoughts [[thought]] inclin'd, 
yet all [[united]] would have shock'd his [[mind]]. 
perhaps, my careless page might be in [[fault]], 
and in a luckless hour the fatal message brought; 
business, and worldly thoughts [[thought]] might fill his breast, 
sometimes ev'n [[love]] itself may be an irksome guest: 
he cou'd not else have treated me with scorn, 
for caunus was not of a tygress born; 
nor steel, nor adamant has fenc'd his [[heart]]; 
like mine, 'tis naked to the burning dart. 

away false fears! he must, he shall be mine; 
in [[death]] alone i will my claim resign; 
'tis [[vain]] to [[wish]] my written crime unknown, 
and for my guilt much vainer to atone. 
repuls'd and baffled, fiercer still she burns, 
and caunus with disdain her impious [[love]] returns. 
he saw no end of her injurious flame, 
and fled his [[country]] to avoid the shame. 
forsaken byblis, who had hopes [[hope]] no more; 
burst out in rage, and her loose robes she tore; 
with her [[fair]] hands she smote her tender breast, 
and to the wond'ring [[world]] her [[love]] confess'd; 
o'er hills and dales, o'er rocks and streams she flew, 
but still in [[vain]] did her wild [[lust]] pursue: 
wearied at length, on the cold [[earth]] she fell, 
and now in tears alone could her [[sad]] story tell. 
relenting gods in [[pity]] fix'd her there, 
and to a fountain turn'd the weeping [[fair]]. 

the fable of iphis and ianthe 

the fame of this, perhaps, thro' crete had flown: 
but crete had newer wonders of her own, 
in iphis chang'd; for, near the gnossian bounds 
(as loud report the miracle resounds), 
at phaestus dwelt a [[man]] of honest [[blood]], 
but meanly born, and not so [[rich]] as [[good]]; 
esteem'd, and lov'd by all the neighbourhood; 
who to his [[wife]], before the [[time]] assign'd 
for child-birth came, thus bluntly spoke his [[mind]]. 
if heav'n, said lygdus, will vouchsafe to hear, 
i have but two petitions to prefer; 
short pains [[pain]] for thee, for me a [[son]] and heir. 
girls cost as many throes in bringing forth; 
beside, when born, the titts are little worth; 
weak puling things, unable to sustain 
their share of [[labour]], and their bread to gain. 
if, therefore, thou a creature shalt [[produce]], 
of so [[great]] charges, and so little use 
(bear witness, heav'n, with what reluctancy), 
her hapless innocence i doom to [[die]]. 
he said, and [[common]] tears the [[common]] [[grief]] display, 
of him who [[bad]], and her who must obey. 

yet telethusa still persists, to find 
fit arguments to move a father's [[mind]]; 
t' extend his wishes [[wish]] to a larger scope, 
and in one vessel not confine his [[hope]]. 
lygdus continues hard: her [[time]] drew near, 
and she her heavy load could scarcely bear; 
when slumbring, in the latter shades of night, 
before th' approaches of returning [[light]], 
she saw, or [[thought]] she saw, before her bed, 
a glorious train, and isis at their head: 
her moony horns were on her forehead plac'd, 
and yellow shelves her shining temples grac'd: 
a mitre, for a [[crown]], she wore on high; 
the dog, and dappl'd bull were waiting by; 
osyris, sought along the banks of nile; 
the silent [[god]]: the [[sacred]] crocodile; 
and, [[last]], a long procession moving on, 
with timbrels, that assist the lab'ring moon. 
her slumbers seem'd dispell'd, and, broad awake, 
she heard a voice, that thus distinctly spake. 
my votary, thy babe from [[death]] defend, 
nor [[fear]] to save whate'er the gods will send. 
delude with art [[arts]] thy husband's dire decree: 
when danger calls, repose thy trust on me: 
and [[know]] thou hast not serv'd a thankless deity. 
this promise made, with night the [[goddess]] fled; 
with joy the woman wakes, and leaves her bed; 
devoutly lifts her spotless hands on high, 
and prays the pow'rs their gift to ratifie. 

now grinding pains [[pain]] proceed to bearing throes, 
'till its own weight the burden did disclose. 
'twas of the beauteous [[kind]], and brought to [[light]] 
with secrecy, to shun the father's sight. 
th' indulgent [[mother]] did her [[care]] employ, 
and [[past]] it on her husband for a boy. 
the nurse was conscious of the [[fact]] alone; 
the [[father]] paid his vows as for a [[son]]; 
and call'd him iphis, by a [[common]] name, 
which either [[sex]] with [[equal]] [[right]] may claim. 
iphis his grandsire was; the [[wife]] was pleas'd, 
of half the fraud by fortune's favour eas'd: 
the doubtful name was us'd without deceit, 
and [[truth]] was cover'd with a pious [[cheat]]. 
the habit show'd a boy, the beauteous face 
with manly fierceness mingled female grace. 

now thirteen years of [[age]] were swiftly run, 
when the fond [[father]] [[thought]] the [[time]] drew on 
of settling in the [[world]] his only [[son]]. 
ianthe was his [[choice]]; so wondrous [[fair]], 
her form alone with iphis cou'd compare; 
a neighbour's [[daughter]] of his own [[degree]], 
and not more bless'd with fortune's goods [[good]] than he. 

they soon espous'd; for they with ease were join'd, 
who were before contracted in the [[mind]]. 
their [[age]] the same, their inclinations too; 
and bred together, in one school they grew. 
thus, fatally dispos'd to mutual fires [[fire]], 
they [[felt]], before they knew, the same desires [[desire]]. 
equal their flame, unequal was their [[care]]; 
one lov'd with [[hope]], one languish'd in despair. 
the maid accus'd the lingring day alone: 
for whom she [[thought]] a [[man]], she [[thought]] her own. 
but iphis bends beneath a greater [[grief]]; 
as fiercely burns, but hopes [[hope]] for no relief. 
ev'n her despair adds fuel to her [[fire]]; 
a maid with madness does a maid [[desire]]. 
and, scarce refraining tears, alas, said she, 
what issue of my [[love]] remains for me! 
how wild a passion works [[work]] within my breast, 
with what prodigious flames am i possest! 
could i the [[care]] of providence deserve, 
heav'n must [[destroy]] me, if it would preserve. 
and that's my [[fate]], or sure it would have sent 
some usual [[evil]] for my [[punishment]]: 
not this unkindly curse; to rage, and burn, 
where [[nature]] shews no prospect of return. 
nor cows for cows consume with fruitless [[fire]]; 
nor mares, when hot, their fellow-mares [[desire]]: 
the [[father]] of the fold supplies his ewes; 
the stag through secret woods his hind pursues; 
and birds for mates the males of their own [[species]] chuse.

her females [[nature]] guards from female flame, 
and joins two sexes [[sex]] to preserve the game: 
wou'd i were nothing, or not what i am! 
crete, fam'd for monsters, wanted of her store, 
'till my new [[love]] produc'd one monster more. 
the [[daughter]] of the sun a bull desir'd, 
and yet ev'n then a male a female fir'd: 
her passion was extravagantly new, 
but mine is much the madder of the two. 
to things impossible she was not bent, 
but found the means to compass her intent. 
to [[cheat]] his [[eyes]] she took a different shape; 
yet still she gain'd a lover, and a leap. 
shou'd all the wit of all the [[world]] conspire, 
shou'd daedalus assist my wild [[desire]], 
what art [[arts]] can make me able to enjoy, 
or what can [[change]] ianthe to a boy? 
extinguish then thy passion, hopeless maid, 
and recollect thy [[reason]] for thy aid. 
know what thou art [[arts]], and [[love]] as maidens ought, 
and drive these golden wishes [[wish]] from thy [[thought]]. 
thou canst not [[hope]] thy fond desires [[desire]] to gain; 
where [[hope]] is wanting, wishes [[wish]] are in [[vain]]. 

and yet no guards against our joys conspire; 
no [[jealous]] husband hinders our [[desire]]; 
my parents are propitious to my [[wish]], 
and she herself consenting to the bliss. 
all things concur to [[prosper]] our design; 
all things to [[prosper]] any [[love]] but mine. 
and yet i never can enjoy the [[fair]]; 
'tis [[past]] the pow'r of heav'n to grant my pray'r. 
heav'n has been [[kind]], as far as heav'n can be; 
our parents with our own desires [[desire]] agree; 
but [[nature]], stronger than the gods above, 
refuses her assistance to my [[love]]; 
she sets the bar that causes all my [[pain]]; 
one gift refus'd, makes all their bounty [[vain]]. 
and now the [[happy]] day is just at hand, 
to bind our hearts [[heart]] in hymen's holy band: 
our hearts [[heart]], but not our bodies [[body]]: thus accurs'd, 
in midst of water i [[complain]] of thirst. 
why com'st thou, juno, to these barren rites, 
to bless a bed defrauded of delights? 
but why shou'd hymen lift his torch on high, 
to see two brides in cold embraces lye? 

thus love-sick iphis her [[vain]] passion mourns; 
with [[equal]] ardour [[fair]] ianthe burns, 
invoking hymen's name, and juno's pow'r, 
to speed the [[work]], and haste the [[happy]] hour. 

she hopes [[hope]], while telethusa fears [[fear]] the day, 
and strives to interpose some new delay: 
now feigns a sickness, now is in a fright 
for this [[bad]] omen, or that boding sight. 
but having done whate'er she could devise, 
and empty'd all her magazine of lies [[lie]], 
the [[time]] approach'd; the next ensuing day 
the fatal secret must to [[light]] betray. 
then telethusa had recourse to pray'r, 
she, and her [[daughter]] with dishevel'd hair; 
trembling with [[fear]], [[great]] isis they ador'd, 
embrac'd her altar, and her aid implor'd. 

fair queen, who dost on fruitful [[egypt]] smile, 
who sway'st the sceptre of the pharian isle, 
and sev'n-fold falls of disemboguing nile, 
relieve, in this our [[last]] distress, she said, 
a suppliant [[mother]], and a mournful maid. 
thou, [[goddess]], thou wert [[present]] to my sight; 
reveal'd i saw thee by thy own [[fair]] [[light]]: 
i saw thee in my [[dream]], as now i see, 
with all thy marks of awful majesty: 
the glorious train that compass'd thee around; 
and heard the hollow timbrels holy sound. 
thy words i noted, which i still retain; 
let not thy [[sacred]] oracles be [[vain]]. 
that iphis lives [[life]], that i myself am [[free]] 
from shame, and [[punishment]], i owe to thee. 
on thy protection all our hopes [[hope]] depend. 
thy counsel sav'd us, let thy pow'r defend. 

her tears pursu'd her words; and while she spoke, 
the [[goddess]] nodded, and her altar shook: 
the temple doors, as with a blast of wind, 
were heard to clap; the lunar horns that bind 
the brows of isis cast a blaze around; 
the trembling timbrel made a murm'ring sound. 

some hopes [[hope]] these [[happy]] omens did impart; 
forth went the [[mother]] with a beating [[heart]]: 
not much in [[fear]], nor fully satisfy'd; 
but iphis follow'd with a larger stride: 
the whiteness of her skin forsook her face; 
her looks embolden'd with an awful grace; 
her features, and her [[strength]] together grew, 
and her long hair to curling locks withdrew. 
her sparkling [[eyes]] with manly vigour shone, 
big was her voice, audacious was her tone. 
the latent parts, at length reveal'd, began 
to shoot, and spread, and burnish into [[man]]. 
the maid becomes a [[youth]]; no more delay 
your vows, but look, and confidently [[pay]]. 
their gifts the parents to the temple bear: 
the votive tables this inscription wear; 
iphis the [[man]], has to the [[goddess]] paid 
the vows, that iphis offer'd when a maid. 

now when the star of day had shewn his face, 
venus and juno with their presence grace 
the nuptial rites, and hymen from above 
descending to compleat their [[happy]] [[love]]; 
the gods of [[marriage]] lend their mutual aid; 
and the warm [[youth]] enjoys the lovely maid.

book the tenth

the story of orpheus and eurydice 

thence, in his saffron robe, for distant thrace, 
hymen departs, thro' air's unmeasur'd space; 
by orpheus call'd, the nuptial pow'r attends, 
but with ill-omen'd augury descends; 
nor chearful look'd the [[god]], nor prosp'rous spoke, 
nor blaz'd his torch, but wept in hissing smoke. 
in [[vain]] they whirl it round, in [[vain]] they shake, 
no rapid motion can its flames awake. 
with dread these inauspicious signs were view'd, 
and soon a more disastrous end ensu'd; 
for as the bride, amid the naiad train, 
ran joyful, sporting o'er the flow'ry plain, 
a venom'd viper bit her as she pass'd; 
instant she fell, and sudden breath'd her [[last]]. 

when long his loss the thracian had deplor'd, 
not by superior pow'rs to be restor'd; 
inflam'd by [[love]], and urg'd by deep despair, 
he leaves the realms of [[light]], and upper air; 
daring to tread the dark tenarian road, 
and tempt the shades in their obscure abode; 
thro' gliding spectres of th' interr'd to go, 
and phantom [[people]] of the [[world]] below: 
persephone he seeks, and him who reigns 
o'er ghosts, and hell's uncomfortable plains. 
arriv'd, he, tuning to his voice his strings, 
thus to the [[king]] and queen of shadows sings. 

ye pow'rs, who under [[earth]] your realms extend, 
to whom all mortals must one day descend; 
if here 'tis granted [[sacred]] [[truth]] to tell: 
i come not [[curious]] to explore your hell; 
nor come to boast (by [[vain]] [[ambition]] fir'd) 
how cerberus at my approach retir'd. 
my [[wife]] alone i seek; for her lov'd sake 
these terrors i support, this [[journey]] take. 
she, luckless wandring, or by [[fate]] mis-led, 
chanc'd on a lurking viper's crest to tread; 
the vengeful beast, enflam'd with fury, starts, 
and thro' her heel his deathful venom darts. 
thus was she snatch'd untimely to her tomb; 
her growing years cut short, and springing bloom. 
long i my loss endeavour'd to sustain, 
and strongly strove, but strove, alas, in [[vain]]: 
at length i yielded, won by mighty [[love]]; 
well known is that omnipotence above! 
but here, i [[doubt]], his unfelt influence fails; 
and yet a [[hope]] within my [[heart]] prevails. 
that here, ev'n here, he has been known of old; 
at least if [[truth]] be by tradition told; 
if fame of former rapes [[belief]] may find, 
you both by [[love]], and [[love]] alone, were join'd. 
now, by the horrors which these realms surround; 
by the vast [[chaos]] of these depths profound; 
by the [[sad]] [[silence]] which eternal reigns 
o'er all the waste of these wide-stretching plains; 
let me again eurydice receive, 
let [[fate]] her quick-spun thread of [[life]] re-weave. 
all our possessions are but loans from you, 
and soon, or late, you must be paid your due; 
hither we haste to human-kind's [[last]] seat, 
your endless [[empire]], and our sure retreat. 
she too, when ripen'd years she shall attain, 
must, of avoidless [[right]], be yours again: 
i but the transient use of that require, 
which soon, too soon, i must resign entire. 
but if the destinies refuse my vow, 
and no remission of her doom allow; 
know, i'm determin'd to return no more; 
so both retain, or both to [[life]] restore. 

thus, while the bard melodiously complains, 
and to his lyre accords his vocal strains, 
the very bloodless shades attention keep, 
and silent, seem compassionate to weep; 
ev'n tantalus his flood unthirsty views, 
nor flies the stream, nor he the stream pursues; 
ixion's wond'ring wheel its whirl suspends, 
and the voracious vulture, charm'd, attends; 
no more the belides their toil bemoan, 
and sisiphus reclin'd, sits list'ning on his stone. 

then first ('tis said) by [[sacred]] verse subdu'd, 
the furies [[felt]] their cheeks with tears bedew'd: 
nor could the rigid [[king]], or queen of hell, 
th' impulse of [[pity]] in their hearts [[heart]] repell. 

now, from a troop of shades that [[last]] arriv'd, 
eurydice was call'd, and stood reviv'd: 
slow she advanc'd, and halting seem to [[feel]] 
the fatal wound, yet painful in her heel. 
thus he obtains the suit so much desir'd, 
on strict observance of the terms requir'd: 
for if, before he reach the realms of air, 
he backward cast his [[eyes]] to view the [[fair]], 
the forfeit grant, that instant, void is made, 
and she for ever left a lifeless shade. 

now thro' the noiseless throng their way they bend, 
and both with [[pain]] the rugged road ascend; 
dark was the path, and difficult, and steep, 
and thick with vapours from the smoaky deep. 
they well-nigh now had pass'd the bounds of night, 
and just approach'd the margin of the [[light]], 
when he, mistrusting lest her steps might stray, 
and gladsome of the glympse of dawning day, 
his longing [[eyes]], impatient, backward cast 
to catch a lover's look, but look'd his [[last]]; 
for, instant dying, she again descends, 
while he to empty air his arms extends. 
again she dy'd, nor yet her [[lord]] reprov'd; 
what could she say, but that too well he lov'd? 
one [[last]] farewell she spoke, which scarce he heard; 
so soon she drop'd, so sudden disappear'd. 

all stunn'd he stood, when thus his [[wife]] he view'd 
by second [[fate]], and double [[death]] subdu'd: 
not more amazement by that wretch was shown, 
whom cerberus beholding, turn'd to stone; 
nor olenus cou'd more astonish'd look, 
when on himself lethaea's [[fault]] he took, 
his beauteous [[wife]], who too secure had dar'd 
her face to vye with goddesses [[goddess]] compar'd: 
once join'd by [[love]], they stand [[united]] still, 
turn'd to contiguous rocks on ida's hill. 

now to repass the styx in [[vain]] he tries, 
charon averse, his pressing suit denies. 
sev'n days entire, along th' infernal shores, 
disconsolate, the bard eurydice deplores; 
defil'd with filth his robe, with tears his cheeks, 
no sustenance but [[grief]], and cares [[care]], he seeks: 
of rigid [[fate]] incessant he complains, 
and hell's inexorable gods arraigns. 
this ended, to high rhodope he hastes, 
and haemus' mountain, bleak with northern blasts. 

and now his yearly [[race]] the circling sun 
had thrice compleat thro' wat'ry pisces run, 
since orpheus fled the face of womankind, 
and all soft union with the [[sex]] declin'd. 
whether his ill [[success]] this [[change]] had bred, 
or binding vows made to his former bed; 
whate'er the cause, in [[vain]] the nymphs [[nymph]] contest, 
with rival [[eyes]] to warm his frozen breast: 
for ev'ry [[nymph]] with [[love]] his lays inspir'd, 
but ev'ry [[nymph]] repuls'd, with [[grief]] retir'd. 

a hill there was, and on that hill a mead, 
with verdure thick, but destitute of shade. 
where, now, the muse's [[son]] no sooner sings, 
no sooner strikes his sweet resounding strings. 
but distant groves the flying sounds receive, 
and list'ning trees their rooted stations leave; 
themselves transplanting, all around they grow, 
and various shades their various kinds [[kind]] bestow. 
here, tall chaonian oaks their branches spread, 
while weeping poplars there erect their head. 
the foodful esculus here shoots his leaves, 
that turf soft lime-tree, this, fat beach receives; 
here, brittle hazels, lawrels here advance, 
and there tough ash to form the heroe's lance; 
here silver firs with knotless trunks ascend, 
there, scarlet oaks beneath their acorns bend. 
that spot admits the hospitable plane, 
on this, the maple grows with clouded grain; 
here, watry willows are with lotus seen; 
there, tamarisk, and box for ever green. 
with double hue here mirtles grace the ground, 
and laurestines, with purple berries crown'd. 
with pliant feet, now, ivies this way wind, 
vines yonder rise, and elms with vines entwin'd. 
wild ornus now, the pitch-tree next takes root, 
and arbutus adorn'd with blushing fruit. 
then easy-bending palms, the victor's prize, 
and pines erect with bristly tops arise. 
for rhea grateful still the pine remains, 
for atys still some favour she retains; 
he once in [[human]] shape her breast had warm'd, 
and now is cherish'd, to a tree transform'd. 

the fable of cyparissus 

amid the throng of this promiscuous wood, 
with pointed top, the taper cypress stood; 
a tree, which once a [[youth]], and heav'nly [[fair]], 
was of that deity the darling [[care]], 
whose hand adapts, with [[equal]] [[skill]], the strings 
to bows with which he kills, and harps to which he sings.

for heretofore, a mighty stag was bred, 
which on the fertile fields of caea fed; 
in shape and size he all his [[kind]] excell'd, 
and to carthaean nymphs [[nymph]] was [[sacred]] held. 
his beamy head, with branches high display'd, 
afforded to itself an ample shade; 
his horns were gilt, and his smooth neck was grac'd 
with silver collars thick with gems enchas'd: 
a silver boss upon his forehead hung, 
and brazen pendants in his ear-rings rung. 
frequenting houses, he familiar grew, 
and learnt by custom, [[nature]] to subdue; 
'till by degrees [[degree]], of [[fear]], and wildness, broke, 
ev'n stranger hands his proffer'd neck might stroak. 

much was the beast by caea's [[youth]] caress'd, 
but thou, sweet cyparissus, lov'dst him [[best]]: 
by thee, to pastures fresh, he oft was [[led]], 
by thee oft water'd at the fountain's head: 
his horns with garlands, now, by thee were ty'd, 
and, now, thou on his back wou'dst wanton ride; 
now here, now there wou'dst bound along the plains, 
ruling his tender mouth with purple reins. 

'twas when the summer sun, at noon of day, 
thro' glowing cancer shot his burning ray, 
'twas then, the fav'rite stag, in cool retreat, 
had sought a shelter from the scorching heat; 
along the grass his weary limbs he laid, 
inhaling freshness from the breezy shade: 
when cyparissus with his pointed dart, 
unknowing, pierc'd him to the panting [[heart]]. 
but when the [[youth]], surpriz'd, his error found, 
and saw him dying of the cruel wound, 
himself he would have slain thro' desp'rate [[grief]]: 
what said not phoebus, that might yield relief! 
to cease his mourning, he the boy desir'd, 
or mourn no more than such a loss requir'd. 
but he, incessant griev'd: at length address'd 
to the superior pow'rs a [[last]] request; 
praying, in expiation of his crime, 
thenceforth to mourn to all succeeding [[time]]. 

and now, of [[blood]] exhausted he appears, 
drain'd by a torrent of continual tears; 
the fleshy colour in his [[body]] fades, 
and a green tincture all his limbs invades; 
from his [[fair]] head, where curling locks late hung, 
a horrid bush with bristled branches sprung, 
which stiffning by degrees [[degree]], its stem extends, 
'till to the starry skies [[sky]] the spire ascends. 

apollo [[sad]] look'd on, and sighing, cry'd, 
then, be for ever, what thy pray'r imply'd: 
bemoan'd by me, in others [[grief]] excite; 
and still preside at ev'ry fun'ral rite. 

thus the sweet artist in a wondrous shade 
of verdant trees, which harmony had made, 
encircled sate, with his own triumphs crown'd, 
of listning birds, and savages around. 
again the trembling strings he dext'rous tries, 
again from discord makes soft musick rise. 
then tunes his voice: o muse, from whom i sprung, 
jove be my theme, and thou inspire my [[song]]. 
to jove my grateful voice i oft have rais'd, 
oft his almighty pow'r with [[pleasure]] prais'd. 
i sung the giants in a solemn strain, 
blasted, and thunder-struck on phlegra's plain. 
now be my lyre in softer accents mov'd, 
to sing of blooming boys by gods belov'd; 
and to relate what virgins, void of shame, 
have suffer'd vengeance for a lawless flame. 

the [[king]] of gods once [[felt]] the burning joy, 
and sigh'd for lovely ganimede of troy: 
long was he puzzled to assume a shape 
most fit, and expeditious for the rape; 
a bird's was proper, yet he scorns to wear 
any but that which might his thunder bear. 
down with his masquerading wings he flies, 
and bears the little trojan to the skies [[sky]]; 
where now, in robes of heav'nly purple drest, 
he serves the nectar at th' almighty's feast, 
to slighted juno an unwelcome guest. 

hyacinthus transform'd into a flower 

phoebus for thee too, hyacinth, design'd 
a place among the gods, had [[fate]] been [[kind]]: 
yet this he gave; as oft as wintry rains 
are [[past]], and vernal breezes sooth the plains, 
from the green turf a purple flow'r you rise, 
and with your fragrant breath perfume the skies [[sky]]. 

you when alive were phoebus' darling boy; 
in you he plac'd his heav'n, and fix'd his joy: 
their [[god]] the delphic priests [[priest]] consult in [[vain]]; 
eurotas now he loves [[love]], and sparta's plain: 
his hands the use of bow and harp forget, 
and hold the dogs, or bear the corded net; 
o'er hanging cliffs swift he pursues the game; 
each hour his [[pleasure]], each augments his flame. 

the mid-day sun now shone with [[equal]] [[light]] 
between the [[past]], and the succeeding night; 
they strip, then, smooth'd with suppling oyl, essay 
to pitch the rounded quoit, their wonted play: 
a well-pois'd disk first hasty phoebus threw, 
it cleft the air, and whistled as it flew; 
it reach'd the mark, a most surprizing length; 
which spoke an [[equal]] share of art [[arts]], and [[strength]]. 
scarce was it fall'n, when with too eager hand 
young hyacinth ran to snatch it from the sand; 
but the curst orb, which met a stony soil, 
flew in his face with [[violent]] recoil. 
both faint, both pale, and breathless now appear, 
the boy with [[pain]], the am'rous [[god]] with [[fear]]. 
he ran, and rais'd him bleeding from the ground, 
chafes his cold limbs, and wipes the fatal wound: 
then herbs of noblest juice in [[vain]] applies; 
the wound is mortal, and his [[skill]] defies. 

as in a water'd garden's blooming walk, 
when some rude hand has bruis'd its tender stalk, 
a fading lilly droops its languid head, 
and bends to [[earth]], its [[life]], and [[beauty]] fled: 
so hyacinth, with head reclin'd, decays, 
and, sickning, now no more his charms displays. 

o thou art [[arts]] gone, my boy, [[apollo]] cry'd, 
defrauded of thy [[youth]] in all its pride! 
thou, once my joy, art [[arts]] all my [[sorrow]] now; 
and to my guilty hand my [[grief]] i owe. 
yet from my [[self]] i might the [[fault]] remove, 
unless to [[sport]], and play, a [[fault]] should prove, 
unless it too were call'd a [[fault]] to [[love]]. 
oh cou'd i for thee, or but with thee, dye! 
but cruel fates [[fate]] to me that pow'r deny. 
yet on my tongue thou shalt for ever dwell; 
thy name my lyre shall sound, my verse shall tell; 
and to a flow'r transform'd, unheard-of yet, 
stamp'd on thy leaves my cries thou shalt repeat. 
the [[time]] shall come, prophetick i foreknow, 
when, joyn'd to thee, a mighty [[chief]] shall grow, 
and with my plaints his name thy leaf shall show. 

while phoebus thus the laws [[law]] of [[fate]] reveal'd, 
behold, the [[blood]] which stain'd the verdant field, 
is [[blood]] no longer; but a flow'r full blown, 
far brighter than the tyrian scarlet shone. 
a lilly's form it took; its purple hue 
was all that made a diff'rence to the view, 
nor stop'd he here; the [[god]] upon its leaves 
the [[sad]] expression of his [[sorrow]] weaves; 
and to this hour the mournful purple wears 
ai, ai, inscrib'd in [[funeral]] characters [[character]]. 
nor are the spartans, who so much are fam'd 
for [[virtue]], of their hyacinth asham'd; 
but still with pompous woe, and solemn [[state]], 
the hyacinthian feasts they yearly celebrate 

the transformations of the cerastae and propoetides 

enquire of amathus, whose wealthy ground 
with veins of every metal does abound, 
if she to her propoetides wou'd show, 
the [[honour]] sparta does to him allow? 
nor more, she'd say, such wretches wou'd we grace, 
than those whose crooked horns deform'd their face, 
from thence cerastae call'd, an impious [[race]]: 
before whose gates a rev'rend altar stood, 
to jove inscrib'd, the hospitable [[god]]: 
this had some stranger seen with gore besmear'd, 
the [[blood]] of lambs, and bulls it had appear'd: 
their slaughter'd guests it was; nor flock nor herd. 

venus these barb'rous sacrifices [[sacrifice]] view'd 
with just abhorrence, and with wrath pursu'd: 
at first, to punish such nefarious crimes, 
their towns she meant to leave, her once-lov'd climes: 
but why, said she, for their offence shou'd i 
my dear delightful plains, and cities [[city]] fly? 
no, let the impious [[people]], who have sinn'd, 
a [[punishment]] in [[death]], or [[exile]], find: 
if [[death]], or [[exile]] too severe be [[thought]], 
let them in some vile shape bemoan their [[fault]]. 
while next her [[mind]] a proper form employs, 
admonish'd by their horns, she fix'd her [[choice]]. 
their former crest remains upon their heads, 
and their [[strong]] limbs an ox's shape invades. 

the blasphemous propoetides deny'd 
worship of [[venus]], and her pow'r defy'd: 
but soon that pow'r they [[felt]], the first that sold 
their lewd embraces to the [[world]] for gold. 
unknowing how to blush, and shameless grown, 
a small transition changes [[change]] them to stone. 

the story of pygmalion and the statue 

pygmalion loathing their lascivious [[life]], 
abhorr'd all womankind, but most a [[wife]]: 
so [[single]] chose to [[live]], and shunn'd to wed, 
well pleas'd to want a consort of his bed. 
yet fearing idleness, the nurse of ill, 
in sculpture exercis'd his [[happy]] [[skill]]; 
and carv'd in iv'ry such a maid, so [[fair]], 
as [[nature]] could not with his art [[arts]] compare, 
were she to [[work]]; but in her own defence 
must take her pattern here, and copy hence. 
pleas'd with his idol, he commends, admires, 
adores; and [[last]], the thing ador'd, desires [[desire]]. 
a very virgin in her face was seen, 
and had she mov'd, a living maid had been: 
one wou'd have [[thought]] she cou'd have stirr'd, but strove

with modesty, and was asham'd to move. 
art hid with art [[arts]], so well perform'd the [[cheat]], 
it caught the carver with his own deceit: 
he knows [[know]] 'tis madness, yet he must adore, 
and still the more he knows [[know]] it, loves [[love]] the more: 
the flesh, or what so seems, he touches oft, 
which feels [[feel]] so smooth, that he believes [[belief]] it soft. 
fir'd with this [[thought]], at once he strain'd the breast,

and on the lips a burning kiss impress'd. 
'tis true, the harden'd breast resists the gripe, 
and the cold lips return a kiss unripe: 
but when, retiring back, he look'd again, 
to [[think]] it iv'ry, was a [[thought]] too mean: 
so wou'd [[believe]] she kiss'd, and courting more, 
again embrac'd her naked [[body]] o'er; 
and straining hard the statue, was afraid 
his hands had made a dint, and hurt his maid: 
explor'd her limb by limb, and fear'd to find 
so rude a gripe had left a livid mark behind: 
with flatt'ry now he seeks her [[mind]] to move, 
and now with gifts (the pow'rful bribes of love), 
he furnishes her closet first; and fills 
the crowded shelves with rarities of shells; 
adds orient pearls, which from the conchs he drew, 
and all the sparkling stones of various hue: 
and parrots, imitating [[human]] tongue, 
and singing-birds in silver cages hung: 
and ev'ry fragrant flow'r, and od'rous green, 
were sorted well, with lumps of amber laid between: 
rich fashionable robes her [[person]] deck, 
pendants her ears, and pearls adorn her neck: 
her taper'd fingers too with rings are grac'd, 
and an embroider'd zone surrounds her slender waste. 
thus like a queen array'd, so richly dress'd, 
beauteous she shew'd, but naked shew'd the [[best]]. 
then, from the floor, he rais'd a [[royal]] bed, 
with cov'rings of sydonian purple spread: 
the solemn rites perform'd, he calls her bride, 
with blandishments invites her to his side; 
and as she were with vital sense possess'd, 
her head did on a plumy pillow rest. 

the feast of [[venus]] came, a solemn day, 
to which the cypriots due devotion [[pay]]; 
with gilded horns the milk-white heifers [[led]], 
slaughter'd before the [[sacred]] altars, bled. 

pygmalion off'ring, first approach'd the shrine, 
and then with pray'rs implor'd the pow'rs [[divine]]: 
almighty gods, if all we mortals want, 
if all we can require, be yours to grant; 
make this [[fair]] statue mine, he wou'd have said, 
but chang'd his words for shame; and only pray'd, 
give me the likeness of my iv'ry maid. 

the golden [[goddess]], [[present]] at the pray'r, 
well knew he meant th' inanimated [[fair]], 
and gave the sign of granting his [[desire]]; 
for thrice in chearful flames ascends the [[fire]]. 
the [[youth]], returning to his mistress, hies, 
and impudent in [[hope]], with ardent [[eyes]], 
and beating breast, by the dear statue lies [[lie]]. 
he kisses her [[white]] lips, renews the bliss, 
and looks, and thinks [[think]] they redden at the kiss; 
he [[thought]] them warm before: nor longer stays, 
but next his hand on her hard bosom lays: 
hard as it was, beginning to relent, 
it seem'd, the breast beneath his fingers bent; 
he [[felt]] again, his fingers made a print; 
'twas flesh, but flesh so firm, it rose against the dint:

the pleasing task he fails not to renew; 
soft, and more soft at ev'ry touch it grew; 
like pliant wax, when chasing hands reduce 
the former mass to form, and frame for use. 
he would [[believe]], but yet is still in [[pain]], 
and tries his argument of sense again, 
presses the pulse, and feels [[feel]] the leaping vein. 
convinc'd, o'erjoy'd, his [[studied]] thanks, and [[praise]], 
to her, who made the miracle, he pays [[pay]]: 
then lips to lips he join'd; now freed from [[fear]], 
he found the savour of the kiss sincere: 
at this the waken'd image op'd her [[eyes]], 
and view'd at once the [[light]], and lover with surprize. 
the [[goddess]], [[present]] at the match she made, 
so bless'd the bed, such fruitfulness convey'd, 
that ere ten months had sharpen'd either horn, 
to [[crown]] their bliss, a lovely boy was born; 
paphos his name, who grown to manhood, wall'd 
the [[city]] paphos, from the founder call'd. 

the story of of cinyras and myrrha 

nor him alone produc'd the fruitful queen; 
but cinyras, who like his sire had been 
a [[happy]] [[prince]], had he not been a sire. 
daughters, and fathers [[father]], from my [[song]] retire; 
i sing of [[horror]]; and could i prevail, 
you shou'd not hear, or not [[believe]] my tale. 
yet if the [[pleasure]] of my [[song]] be such, 
that you will hear, and credit me too much, 
attentive listen to the [[last]] event, 
and, with the [[sin]], [[believe]] the [[punishment]]: 
since [[nature]] cou'd behold so dire a crime, 
i gratulate at least my native clime, 
that such a [[land]], which such a monster bore, 
so far is distant from our thracian shore. 
let araby extol her [[happy]] coast, 
her cinamon, and sweet amomum boast, 
her fragrant flow'rs, her trees with precious tears, 
her second harvests, and her double years; 
how can the [[land]] be call'd so bless'd, that myrrha bears?

nor all her od'rous tears can cleanse her crime; 
her plant alone deforms the [[happy]] clime: 
cupid denies to have inflam'd thy [[heart]], 
disowns thy [[love]], and vindicates his dart: 
some fury gave thee those infernal pains [[pain]], 
and shot her venom'd vipers in thy veins. 
to hate thy sire, had merited a curse; 
but such an impious [[love]] deserv'd a worse. 
the neighb'ring monarchs, by thy [[beauty]] [[led]], 
contend in crowds, ambitious of thy bed: 
the [[world]] is at thy [[choice]]; except but one, 
except but him, thou canst not chuse, alone. 
she knew it too, the miserable maid, 
ere impious [[love]] her [[better]] thoughts [[thought]] betray'd, 
and thus within her secret [[soul]] she said: 
ah myrrha! whither wou'd thy wishes [[wish]] tend? 
ye gods, ye [[sacred]] laws [[law]], my [[soul]] defend 
from such a crime as all [[mankind]] detest, 
and never lodg'd before in [[human]] breast! 
but is it [[sin]]? or makes my [[mind]] alone 
th' imagin'd [[sin]]? for [[nature]] makes it none. 
what [[tyrant]] then these envious laws [[law]] began, 
made not for any other beast, but man! 
the father-bull his [[daughter]] may bestride, 
the horse may make his mother-mare a bride; 
what piety forbids the lusty ram, 
or more salacious goat, to rut their dam? 
the hen is [[free]] to wed the chick she bore, 
and make a husband, whom she hatch'd before. 
all creatures else are of a happier [[kind]], 
whom nor ill-natur'd laws [[law]] from [[pleasure]] bind, 
nor thoughts [[thought]] of [[sin]] disturb their [[peace]] of [[mind]]. 
but [[man]] a [[slave]] of his own making lives [[life]]; 
the [[fool]] denies himself what [[nature]] gives: 
too-busie senates, with an over-care, 
to make us [[better]] than our [[kind]] can bear, 
have dash'd a spice of envy in the laws [[law]], 
and straining up too high, have spoil'd the cause. 
yet some [[wise]] nations break their cruel chains, 
and own no laws [[law]], but those which [[love]] ordains; 
where [[happy]] daughters [[daughter]] with their sires are join'd, 
and piety is doubly paid in [[kind]]. 
o that i had been born in such a clime, 
not here, where 'tis the [[country]] makes the crime! 
but whither wou'd my impious fancy stray? 
hence hopes [[hope]], and ye forbidden thoughts [[thought]] away! 
his worth deserves to kindle my desires [[desire]], 
but with the [[love]], that daughters [[daughter]] bear to sires. 
then had not cinyras my [[father]] been, 
what hinder'd myrrha's hopes [[hope]] to be his queen? 
but the perverseness of my [[fate]] is such, 
that he's not mine, because he's mine too much: 
our kindred-blood debars a [[better]] tie; 
he might be nearer, were he not so nigh. 
eyes, and their objects, never must unite; 
some distance is requir'd to [[help]] the sight: 
fain wou'd i travel to some [[foreign]] shore, 
never to see my native [[country]] more, 
so might i to my [[self]] my [[self]] restore; 
so might my [[mind]] these impious thoughts [[thought]] remove, 
and ceasing to behold, might cease to [[love]]. 
but stay i must, to feed my famish'd sight, 
to talk, to kiss, and more, if more i might: 
more, impious maid! what more canst thou design? 
to make a monstrous mixture in thy line, 
and break all statutes [[human]] and divine! 
can'st thou be call'd (to save thy wretched life) 
thy mother's rival, and thy father's [[wife]]? 
confound so many [[sacred]] names in one, 
thy brother's mother! sister to thy son! 
and fear'st thou not to see th' infernal bands, 
their heads with snakes; with torches arm'd their hands 
full at thy face th' avenging brands to bear, 
and shake the serpents from their hissing hair; 
but thou in [[time]] th' increasing ill controul, 
nor first debauch the [[body]] by the [[soul]]; 
secure the [[sacred]] quiet of thy [[mind]], 
and keep the sanctions [[nature]] has design'd. 
suppose i shou'd attempt, th' attempt were [[vain]], 
no thoughts [[thought]] like mine, his sinless [[soul]] profane; 
observant of the [[right]]: and o that he 
cou'd cure my madness, or be mad like me! 
thus she: but cinyras, who daily sees 
a crowd of [[noble]] suitors at his knees, 
among so many, knew not whom to chuse, 
irresolute to grant, or to refuse. 
but having told their names, enquir'd of her 
who pleas'd her [[best]], and whom she would prefer. 
the blushing maid stood silent with surprize, 
and on her [[father]] fix'd her ardent [[eyes]], 
and looking sigh'd, and as she sigh'd, began 
round tears to shed, that scalded as they ran. 
the tender sire, who saw her blush, and cry, 
ascrib'd it all to maiden modesty, 
and dry'd the falling drops, and yet more [[kind]], 
he stroak'd her cheeks, and holy kisses join'd. 
she [[felt]] a secret venom [[fire]] her [[blood]], 
and found more [[pleasure]], than a [[daughter]] shou'd; 
and, ask'd again what lover of the crew 
she lik'd the [[best]], she answer'd, one like you. 
mistaking what she meant, her pious will 
he prais'd, and bid her so continue still: 
the word of pious heard, she blush'd with shame 
of secret guilt, and cou'd not bear the name. 

'twas now the mid of night, when slumbers close 
our [[eyes]], and sooth our cares [[care]] with soft repose; 
but no repose cou'd wretched myrrha find, 
her [[body]] rouling, as she roul'd her [[mind]]: 
mad with [[desire]], she ruminates her [[sin]], 
and wishes [[wish]] all her wishes [[wish]] o'er again: 
now she despairs, and now resolves to try; 
wou'd not, and wou'd again, she knows [[know]] not why; 
stops, and returns; makes, and retracts the vow; 
fain wou'd begin, but understands not how. 
as when a pine is hew'd upon the plains, 
and the [[last]] mortal stroke alone remains, 
lab'ring in pangs of [[death]], and threatning all, 
this way, and that she nods, consid'ring where to fall: 
so myrrha's [[mind]], impell'd on either side, 
takes ev'ry bent, but cannot long abide; 
irresolute on which she shou'd relie, 
at [[last]], unfix'd in all, is only fix'd to [[die]]. 
on that [[sad]] [[thought]] she rests, resolv'd on [[death]], 
she rises, and prepares to choak her breath: 
then while about the beam her zone she ties, 
dear cinyras farewell, she softly cries; 
for thee i [[die]], and only [[wish]] to be 
not hated, when thou know'st [[die]] i for thee: 
pardon the crime, in [[pity]] to the cause: 
this said, about her neck the noose she draws. 
the nurse, who lay without, her faithful guard, 
though not the words, the murmurs over-heard; 
and sighs, and hollow sounds: surpriz'd with fright, 
she starts, and leaves her bed, and springs a [[light]]; 
unlocks the door, and entring out of breath, 
the dying saw, and instruments of [[death]]; 
she shrieks, she cuts the zone with trembling haste, 
and in her arms her fainting charge embrac'd: 
next (for she now had leisure for her tears), 
she weeping ask'd, in these her blooming years, 
what unforeseen misfortune caus'd her [[care]], 
to loath her [[life]], and languish in despair! 
the maid, with down-cast [[eyes]], and mute with [[grief]] 
for [[death]] unfinish'd, and ill-tim'd relief, 
stood sullen to her suit: the beldame press'd 
the more to [[know]], and bar'd her wither'd breast, 
adjur'd her by the kindly food she drew 
from those dry founts, her secret ill to shew. 
sad myrrha sigh'd, and turn'd her [[eyes]] aside: 
the nurse still urg'd, and wou'd not be deny'd: 
nor only promis'd secresie, but pray'd 
she might have leave to give her offer'd aid. 
good-will, she said, my want of [[strength]] supplies, 
and diligence shall give what [[age]] denies: 
if [[strong]] desires [[desire]] thy [[mind]] to fury move, 
with charms and med'cines i can cure thy [[love]]: 
if envious [[eyes]] their hurtuful rays have cast, 
more pow'rful verse shall [[free]] thee from the blast: 
if heav'n offended sends thee this disease, 
offended heav'n with pray'rs we can appease. 
what then remains, that can these cares [[care]] procure? 
thy house is flourishing, thy [[fortune]] sure: 
thy careful [[mother]] yet in health survives, 
and, to thy comfort, thy [[kind]] [[father]] lives [[life]]. 
the virgin started at her father's name, 
and sigh'd profoundly, conscious of the shame 
nor yet the nurse her impious [[love]] divin'd, 
but yet surmis'd that [[love]] disturb'd her [[mind]]: 
thus thinking, she pursu'd her point, and laid, 
and lull'd within her lap the mourning maid; 
then softly sooth'd her thus; i guess your [[grief]]: 
you [[love]], my child; your [[love]] shall find relief. 
my long-experienc'd [[age]] shall be your guide; 
rely on that, and lay distrust aside. 
no breath of air shall on the secret blow, 
nor shall (what most you fear) your [[father]] [[know]]. 
struck once again, as with a thunder-clap, 
the guilty virgin bounded from her lap, 
and threw her [[body]] prostrate on the bed. 
and, to conceal her blushes, hid her head; 
there silent lay, and warn'd her with her hand 
to go: but she receiv'd not the command; 
remaining still importunate to [[know]]: 
then myrrha thus: or ask no more, or go; 
i pr'ythee go, or staying spare my shame; 
what thou would'st hear, is impious ev'n to name. 
at this, on high the beldame holds her hands, 
and trembling both with [[age]], and terror stands; 
adjures, and falling at her feet intreats, 
sooths her with blandishments, and frights with threats,

to tell the crime intended, or disclose 
what part of it she knew, if she no farther knows [[know]]. 
and [[last]], if conscious to her counsel made, 
confirms anew the promise of her aid. 
now myrrha rais'd her head; but soon oppress'd 
with shame, reclin'd it on her nurse's breast; 
bath'd it with tears, and strove to have confess'd: 
twice she began, and stopp'd; again she try'd; 
the falt'ring tongue its office still deny'd. 
at [[last]] her veil before her face she spread, 
and drew a long preluding sigh, and said, 
o [[happy]] [[mother]], in thy marriage-bed! 
then groan'd, and ceas'd. the [[good]] old woman shook, 
stiff were her [[eyes]], and ghastly was her look: 
her hoary hair upright with [[horror]] stood, 
made (to her grief) more knowing than she wou'd. 
much she reproach'd, and many things she said, 
to cure the madness of th' unhappy maid, 
in [[vain]]: for myrrha stood convict of ill; 
her [[reason]] vanquish'd, but unchang'd her will: 
perverse of [[mind]], unable to reply; 
she stood resolv'd, or to possess, or [[die]]. 
at length the fondness of a nurse prevail'd 
against her [[better]] sense, and [[virtue]] fail'd: 
enjoy, my child, since such is thy [[desire]], 
thy [[love]], she said; she durst not say, thy sire: 
live, though unhappy, [[live]] on any terms; 
then with a second oath her [[faith]] confirms. 

the solemn feast of ceres now was near, 
when long [[white]] linnen stoles the matrons wear; 
rank'd in procession walk the pious train, 
off'ring first-fruits, and spikes of yellow grain: 
for nine long nights the nuptial-bed they shun, 
and sanctifying harvest, [[lie]] alone. 

mix'd with the crowd, the queen forsook her [[lord]], 
and ceres' pow'r with secret rites ador'd: 
the [[royal]] couch, now vacant for a [[time]], 
the crafty crone, officious in her crime, 
the first [[occasion]] took: the [[king]] she found 
easie with wine, and deep in pleasures [[pleasure]] drown'd, 
prepar'd for [[love]]: the beldame blew the flame, 
confess'd the passion, but conceal'd the name. 
her form she prais'd; the monarch ask'd her years; 
and she reply'd, the same thy myrrha bears. 
wine, and commended [[beauty]] fir'd his [[thought]]; 
impatient, he commands her to be brought. 
pleas'd with her charge perform'd, she hies her [[home]], 
and gratulates the [[nymph]], the task was overcome. 
myrrha was joy'd the welcome news to hear; 
but clog'd with guilt, the joy was unsincere: 
so various, so discordant is the [[mind]], 
that in our will a diff'rent will we find. 
ill she presag'd, and yet pursu'd her [[lust]]; 
for guilty pleasures [[pleasure]] give a double gust. 

'twas depth of night: arctophylax had driv'n 
his lazy wain half round the northern heav'n, 
when myrrha hasten'd to the crime desir'd: 
the moon beheld her first, and first retir'd: 
the stars amaz'd, ran backward from the sight, 
and (shrunk within their sockets) lost their [[light]]. 
icarius first withdraws his holy flame: 
the virgin sign, in heav'n the second name, 
slides down the belt, and from her station flies, 
and night with sable clouds involves the skies [[sky]]. 
bold myrrha still pursues her black intent; 
she stumbled thrice (an omen of th' event); 
thrice shriek'd the fun'ral owl, yet on she went, 
secure of shame, because secure of sight; 
ev'n bashful sins [[sin]] are impudent by night. 
link'd hand in hand, th' accomplice, and the dame, 
their way exploring, to the chamber came: 
the door was ope; they blindly grope their way, 
where dark in bed th' expecting monarch lay. 
thus far her [[courage]] held, but here forsakes; 
her faint knees knock at ev'ry step she makes. 
the nearer to her crime, the more within 
she feels [[feel]] remorse, and [[horror]] of her [[sin]]; 
repents too late her [[criminal]] [[desire]], 
and wishes [[wish]], that unknown she could retire. 
her lingring thus, the nurse (who fear'd delay 
the fatal secret might at length betray) 
pull'd forward, to compleat the [[work]] begun, 
and said to cinyras, receive thy own. 
thus saying, she deliver'd [[kind]] to [[kind]], 
accurs'd, and their devoted bodies [[body]] join'd. 
the sire, unknowing of the crime, admits 
his bowels, and prophanes the hallow'd sheets; 
he found she trembled, but believ'd she strove 
with maiden modesty against her [[love]], 
and sought with flatt'ring words [[vain]] fancies to remove.

perhaps he said, my [[daughter]], cease thy fears [[fear]] 
(because the title suited with her years); 
and, [[father]], she might whisper him again, 
that names might not be wanting to the [[sin]]. 

full of her sire, she left th' incestuous bed, 
and carry'd in her womb the crime she bred. 
another, and another night she came; 
for frequent [[sin]] had left no sense of shame: 
'till cinyras desir'd to see her face, 
whose [[body]] he had held in close embrace, 
and brought a taper; the revealer, [[light]], 
expos'd both crime, and [[criminal]] to sight. 
grief, rage, amazement, could no [[speech]] afford, 
but from the sheath he drew th' avenging [[sword]]: 
the guilty fled: the benefit of night, 
that favour'd first the [[sin]], secur'd the flight. 
long wand'ring thro' the spacious fields, she bent 
her [[voyage]] to th' arabian continent; 
then pass'd the region which panchaea join'd, 
and flying, left the palmy plains behind. 
nine times [[time]] the moon had mew'd her horns; at length 
with travel weary, unsupply'd with [[strength]], 
and with the burden of her womb oppress'd, 
sabaean fields afford her needful rest: 
there, loathing [[life]], and yet of [[death]] afraid, 
in anguish of her spirit, thus she pray'd: 
ye pow'rs, if any so propitious are 
t' accept my penitence, and hear my pray'r; 
your judgments [[judgment]], i confess, are justly sent; 
great sins [[sin]] deserve as [[great]] a [[punishment]]: 
yet since my [[life]] the living will profane, 
and since my [[death]] the [[happy]] [[dead]] will stain, 
a middle [[state]] your [[mercy]] may bestow, 
betwixt the realms above, and those below: 
some other form to wretched myrrha give, 
nor let her wholly [[die]], nor wholly [[live]]. 

the pray'rs of penitents are never [[vain]]; 
at least she did her [[last]] request obtain: 
for while she spoke, the ground began to rise, 
and gather'd round her feet, her legs, and thighs; 
her toes in roots descend, and spreading wide, 
a firm foundation for the trunk provide: 
her solid bones convert to solid wood, 
to pith her marrow, and to sap her [[blood]]: 
her arms are boughs, her fingers [[change]] their [[kind]], 
her tender skin is harden'd into rind. 
and now the rising tree her womb invests, 
now shooting upwards still, invades her breasts, 
and shades the neck; when weary with delay, 
she sunk her head within, and met it half the way. 
and tho' with outward shape she lost her sense, 
with bitter tears she wept her [[last]] offence; 
and still she weeps, nor sheds her tears in [[vain]]; 
for still the precious drops her name retain. 
mean-time the mis-begotten infant grows, 
and ripe for birth, distends with deadly throes 
the swelling rind, with unavailing strife, 
to leave the wooden womb, and pushes into [[life]]. 
the mother-tree, as if oppress'd with [[pain]], 
writhes here, and there, to break the bark, in [[vain]]; 
and, like a lab'ring woman, wou'd have pray'd, 
but wants a voice to call lucina's aid: 
the bending bole sends out a hollow sound, 
and trickling tears fall thicker on the ground. 
the mild lucina came uncall'd, and stood 
beside the struggling boughs, and heard the groaning wood;

then reach'd her midwife-hand to speed the throes, 
and spoke the pow'rful spells, that babes to birth disclose.

the bark divides, the living load to [[free]], 
and safe delivers the convulsive tree. 
the ready nymphs [[nymph]] receive the crying child, 
and wash him in the tears the parent plant distill'd. 
they swath'd him with their scarfs; beneath him spread 
the ground with herbs; with roses rais'd his head. 
the lovely babe was born with ev'ry grace, 
ev'n envy must have prais'd so [[fair]] a face: 
such was his form, as painters when they show 
their utmost art [[arts]], on naked loves [[love]] bestow: 
and that their arms no diff'rence might betray, 
give him a bow, or his from cupid take away. 
time glides along with undiscover'd haste, 
the future but a length behind the [[past]]; 
so swift are years. the babe, whom just before 
his grandsire got, and whom his sister bore; 
the drop, the thing, which late the tree inclos'd, 
and late the yawning bark to [[life]] expos'd; 
a babe, a boy, a beauteous [[youth]] appears, 
and lovelier than himself at riper years. 
now to the queen of [[love]] he gave desires [[desire]], 
and, with her pains [[pain]], reveng'd his mother's fires [[fire]]. 

the story of [[venus]] and adonis 

for cytherea's lips while cupid prest, 
he with a heedless arrow raz'd her breast, 
the [[goddess]] [[felt]] it, and with fury stung, 
the wanton mischief from her bosom flung: 
yet [[thought]] at first the danger slight, but found 
the dart too faithful, and too deep the wound. 
fir'd with a mortal [[beauty]], she disdains 
to haunt th' idalian mount, or phrygian plains. 
she seeks not cnidos, nor her paphian shrines, 
nor amathus, that teems with brazen mines: 
ev'n heav'n itself with all its sweets unsought, 
adonis far a sweeter heav'n is [[thought]]. 
on him she hangs, and fonds with ev'ry art [[arts]], 
and never, never knows [[know]] from him to part. 
she, whose soft limbs had only been display'd 
on rosie beds beneath the myrtle shade, 
whose pleasing [[care]] was to improve each grace, 
and add more charms to an unrival'd face, 
now buskin'd, like the virgin huntress, goes 
thro' woods, and pathless wilds, and mountain-snows 
with her own tuneful voice she joys to cheer 
the panting hounds, that chace the flying deer. 
she runs the labyrinth of fearful hares, 
but fearless beasts, and dang'rous prey forbears, 
hunts not the grinning wolf, or foamy boar, 
and trembles at the lion's hungry roar. 
thee too, adonis, with a lover's [[care]] 
she warns, if warn'd thou wou'dst avoid the snare, 
to furious animals advance not nigh, 
fly those that [[follow]], [[follow]] those that fly; 
'tis [[chance]] alone must the survivors save, 
whene'er brave spirits will attempt the brave. 
o! lovely youth! in harmless sports [[sport]] delight; 
provoke not beasts, which, arm'd by [[nature]], [[fight]]. 
for me, if not thy [[self]], vouchsafe to [[fear]]; 
let not thy thirst of [[glory]] cost me dear. 
boars [[know]] not bow to spare a blooming [[age]]; 
no sparkling [[eyes]] can sooth the lion's rage. 
not all thy charms a savage breast can move, 
which have so deeply touch'd the queen of [[love]]. 
when bristled boars from beaten thickets spring, 
in grinded tusks a thunderbolt they bring. 
the daring hunters lions rouz'd devour, 
vast is their fury, and as vast their pow'r: 
curst be their tawny race! if thou would'st hear 
what kindled thus my hate, then lend an ear: 
the wond'rous tale i will to thee unfold, 
how the fell monsters rose from crimes of old. 
but by long toils i faint: see! wide-display'd, 
a grateful poplar courts us with a shade. 
the grassy turf, beneath, so verdant shows, 
we may secure delightfully repose. 
with her adonis here be [[venus]] blest; 
and swift at once the grass and him she prest. 
then sweetly smiling, with a raptur'd [[mind]], 
on his lov'd bosom she her head reclin'd, 
and thus began; but mindful still of bliss, 
seal'd the soft accents with a softer kiss. 

perhaps thou may'st have heard a virgin's name, 
who still in swiftness swiftest youths [[youth]] o'ercame. 
wondrous! that female weakness should outdo 
a manly [[strength]]; the wonder yet is true. 
'twas doubtful, if her triumphs in the field 
did to her form's triumphant glories yield; 
whether her face could with more ease decoy 
a crowd of lovers, or her feet [[destroy]]. 
for once [[apollo]] she implor'd to show 
if courteous fates [[fate]] a consort would allow: 
a consort brings thy ruin, he reply'd; 
o! learn to want the pleasures [[pleasure]] of a bride! 
nor shalt thou want them to thy wretched cost, 
and atalanta living shall be lost. 
with such a rueful [[fate]] th' affrighted maid 
sought green recesses in the wood-land glade. 
nor sighing suiters her resolves could move, 
she [[bad]] them show their speed, to show their [[love]]. 
he only, who could conquer in the [[race]], 
might [[hope]] the conquer'd virgin to embrace; 
while he, whose tardy feet had lagg'd behind, 
was doom'd the [[sad]] [[reward]] of [[death]] to find. 
tho' [[great]] the prize, yet rigid the decree, 
but blind with [[beauty]], who can rigour see? 
ev'n on these laws [[law]] the [[fair]] they rashly sought, 
and danger in excess of [[love]] forgot. 

there sat hippomenes, prepar'd to blame 
in lovers such extravagance of flame. 
and must, he said, the blessing of a [[wife]] 
be dearly purchas'd by a risk of [[life]]? 
but when he saw the wonders of her face, 
and her limbs naked, springing to the [[race]], 
her limbs, as exquisitely turn'd, as mine, 
or if a woman thou, might vie with thine, 
with lifted hands, he cry'd, [[forgive]] the tongue 
which durst, ye youths [[youth]], your well-tim'd [[courage]] [[wrong]]. 
i knew not that the [[nymph]], for whom you strove, 
deserv'd th' unbounded transports of your [[love]]. 
he saw, admir'd, and thus her spotless frame 
he prais'd, and praising, kindled his own flame. 
a rival now to all the youths [[youth]] who run, 
envious, he fears [[fear]] they should not be undone. 
but why (reflects he) idly thus is shown 
the [[fate]] of others, yet untry'd my own? 
the [[coward]] must not on love's aid depend; 
the [[god]] was ever to the bold a friend. 
mean-time the virgin flies, or seems to fly, 
swift as a scythian arrow cleaves the [[sky]]: 
still more and more the [[youth]] her charms admires. 
the [[race]] itself t' exalt her charms conspires. 
the golden pinions, which her feet adorn, 
in wanton flutt'rings by the winds are born. 
down from her head, the long, [[fair]] tresses flow, 
and [[sport]] with lovely negligence below. 
the waving ribbands, which her buskins tie, 
her snowy skin with waving purple [[die]]; 
as crimson veils in palaces display'd, 
to the [[white]] marble lend a blushing shade. 
nor long he gaz'd, yet while he gaz'd, she gain'd 
the goal, and the victorious wreath obtain'd. 
the vanquish'd sigh, and, as the [[law]] decreed, 
pay the dire forfeit, and prepare to bleed. 

then rose hippomenes, not yet afraid, 
and fix'd his [[eyes]] full on the beauteous maid. 
where is (he cry'd) the mighty [[conquest]] won, 
to distance those, who want the nerves to run? 
here prove superior [[strength]], nor shall it be 
thy loss of [[glory]], if excell'd by me. 
high my descent, near [[neptune]] i aspire, 
for [[neptune]] was grand-parent to my sire. 
from that [[great]] [[god]] the fourth my [[self]] i trace, 
nor sink my virtues [[virtue]] yet beneath my [[race]]. 
thou from hippomenes, o'ercome, may'st claim 
an envy'd triumph, and a deathless fame. 

while thus the [[youth]] the virgin pow'r defies, 
silent she views him still with softer [[eyes]]. 
thoughts in her breast a doubtful strife begin, 
if 'tis not happier now to lose, than [[win]]. 
what [[god]], a foe to [[beauty]], would [[destroy]] 
the promis'd ripeness of this blooming boy? 
with his life's danger does he seek my bed? 
scarce am i half so greatly worth, she said. 
nor has his [[beauty]] mov'd my breast to [[love]], 
and yet, i own, such [[beauty]] well might move: 
'tis not his charms, 'tis [[pity]] would engage 
my [[soul]] to spare the greenness of his [[age]]. 
what, that heroick conrage fires [[fire]] his breast, 
and shines thro' brave disdain of [[fate]] confest? 
what, that his patronage by close degrees [[degree]] 
springs from th' imperial ruler of the seas? 
then add the [[love]], which bids him undertake 
the [[race]], and dare to perish for my sake. 
of bloody nuptials, heedless [[youth]], beware! 
fly, timely fly from a too barb'rous [[fair]]. 
at [[pleasure]] chuse; thy [[love]] will be repaid 
by a less foolish, and more beauteous maid. 
but why this tenderness, before unknown? 
why beats, and pants my breast for him alone? 
his [[eyes]] have seen his num'rous rivals yield; 
let him too share the rigour of the field, 
since, by their fates [[fate]] untaught, his own he courts, 
and thus with ruin insolently sports [[sport]]. 
yet for what crime shall he his [[death]] receive? 
is it a crime with me to [[wish]] to [[live]]? 
shall his [[kind]] passion his destruction prove? 
is this the fatal recompence of [[love]]? 
so [[fair]] a [[youth]], destroy'd, would [[conquest]] shame, 
aud nymphs [[nymph]] eternally detest my fame. 
still why should nymphs [[nymph]] my guiltless fame upbraid? 
did i the fond adventurer persuade? 
alas! i [[wish]] thou would'st the course decline, 
or that my swiftness was excell'd by thine. 
see! what a virgin's bloom adorns the boy! 
why wilt thou run, and why thy [[self]] [[destroy]]? 
hippomenes! o that i ne'er had been 
by those bright [[eyes]] unfortunately seen! 
ah! tempt not thus a swift, untimely [[fate]]; 
thy [[life]] is worthy of the longest date. 
were i less wretched, did the galling chain 
of rigid gods not my [[free]] [[choice]] restrain, 
by thee alone i could with joy be [[led]] 
to taste the raptures of a nuptial bed. 

thus she disclos'd the woman's secret [[heart]], 
young, [[innocent]], and new to cupid's dart. 
her thoughts [[thought]], her words, her actions wildly rove, 
with [[love]] she burns, yet knows [[know]] not that 'tis [[love]]. 

her [[royal]] sire now with the murm'ring crowd 
demands the [[race]] impatiently aloud. 
hippomenes then with true fervour pray'd, 
my bold attempt let [[venus]] kindly aid. 
by her sweet pow'r i [[felt]] this am'rous [[fire]], 
still may she succour, whom she did inspire. 
a soft, unenvious wind, with speedy [[care]], 
wafted to heav'n the lover's tender pray'r. 
pity, i own, soon gain'd the wish'd [[consent]], 
and all th' assistance he implor'd i lent. 
the cyprian lands [[land]], tho' [[rich]], in richness yield 
to that, surnam'd the tamasenian field. 
that field of old was added to my shrine, 
and its [[choice]] products consecrated mine. 
a tree there stands, full glorious to behold, 
gold are the leafs, the crackling branches gold. 
it chanc'd, three apples in my hand i bore, 
which newly from the tree i sportive tore; 
seen by the [[youth]] alone, to him i brought 
the fruit, and when, and how to use it, taught. 
the signal sounding by the king's command, 
both start at once, and sweep th' imprinted sand. 
so swiftly mov'd their feet, they might with ease, 
scarce moisten'd, skim along the glassy seas; 
or with a wondrous levity be born 
o'er yellow harvests of unbending corn. 
now fav'ring peals resound from ev'ry part, 
spirit the [[youth]], and [[fire]] his fainting [[heart]]. 
hippomenes! (they cry'd) thy [[life]] preserve, 
intensely [[labour]], and stretch ev'ry nerve. 
base [[fear]] alone can baffle thy design, 
shoot boldly onward, and the goal is thine. 
'tis doubtful whether shouts, like these, convey'd 
more pleasures [[pleasure]] to the [[youth]], or to the maid. 
when a long distance oft she could have gain'd, 
she check'd her swiftness, and her feet restrain'd: 
she sigh'd, and dwelt, and languish'd on his face, 
then with unwilling speed pursu'd the [[race]]. 
o'er-spent with heat, his breath he faintly drew, 
parch'd was his mouth, nor yet the goal in view, 
and the first apple on the plain he threw. 
the [[nymph]] stop'd sudden at th' unusual sight, 
struck with the fruit so beautifully bright. 
aside she starts, the wonder to behold, 
and eager stoops to catch the rouling gold. 
th' observant [[youth]] [[past]] by, and scour'd along, 
while peals of joy rung from th' applauding throng. 
unkindly she corrects the short delay, 
and to redeem the [[time]] fleets swift away, 
swift, as the lightning, or the northern wind, 
and far she leaves the panting [[youth]] behind. 
again he strives the flying [[nymph]] to hold 
with the temptation of the second gold: 
the bright temptation fruitlessly was tost, 
so soon, alas! she won the distance lost. 
now but a little interval of space 
remain'd for the decision of the [[race]]. 
fair author of the precious gift, he said, 
be thou, o [[goddess]], author of my aid! 
then of the shining fruit the [[last]] he drew, 
and with his full-collected vigour threw: 
the virgin still the longer to detain, 
threw not directly, but a-cross the plain. 
she seem'd a-while perplex'd in dubious [[thought]], 
if the far-distant apple should be sought: 
i lur'd her backward [[mind]] to seize the bait, 
and to the massie gold gave double weight. 
my favour to my votary was show'd, 
her speed i lessen'd, and encreas'd her load. 
but lest, tho' long, the rapid [[race]] be run, 
before my longer, tedious tale is done, 
the [[youth]] the goal, and so the virgin won. 

might i, adonis, now not [[hope]] to see 
his grateful thanks pour'd out for [[victory]]? 
his pious incense on my altars laid? 
but he nor grateful thanks, nor incense paid. 
enrag'd i vow'd, that with the [[youth]] the [[fair]], 
for his contempt, should my keen vengeance share; 
that future lovers might my pow'r revere, 
and, from their [[sad]] examples [[example]], learn to [[fear]]. 
the silent fanes, the sanctify'd abodes, 
of cybele, [[great]] [[mother]] of the gods, 
rais'd by echion in a lonely wood, 
and full of brown, [[religious]] [[horror]] stood. 
by a long painful [[journey]] faint, they chose! 
their weary limbs here secret to repose. 
but soon my pow'r inflam'd the lustful boy, 
careless of rest he sought untimely joy. 
a hallow'd gloomy cave, with moss o'er-grown, 
the temple join'd, of native pumice-stone, 
where antique images by priests [[priest]] were kept. 
and wooden deities securely slept. 
thither the rash hippomenes retires, 
and gives a loose to all his wild desires [[desire]], 
and the chaste cell pollutes with wanton fires [[fire]]. 
the [[sacred]] statues trembled with surprize, 
the tow'ry [[goddess]], blushing, veil'd her [[eyes]]; 
and the lewd pair to stygian sounds had sent, 
but unrevengeful seem'd that [[punishment]], 
a heavier doom such black prophaneness draws, 
their taper figures turn to crooked paws. 
no more their necks the smoothness can retain, 
now cover'd sudden with a yellow mane. 
arms [[change]] to legs: each finds the hard'ning breast 
of rage unknown, and wond'rous [[strength]] possest. 
their alter'd looks with fury grim appear, 
and on the ground their brushing tails they hear. 
they haunt the woods: their voices, which before 
were musically sweet, now hoarsly roar. 
hence lions, dreadful to the lab'ring swains, 
are tam'd by cybele, and curb'd with reins, 
and humbly draw her car along the plains. 
but thou, adonis, my delightful [[care]], 
of these, and beasts, as fierce as these, beware! 
the savage, which not shuns thee, timely shun, 
for by rash prowess should'st thou be undone, 
a double ruin is contain'd in one. 
thus cautious [[venus]] school'd her fav'rite boy; 
but youthful heat all cautions will [[destroy]]. 
his sprightly [[soul]] beyond grave counsels flies, 
while with yok'd swans the [[goddess]] cuts the skies [[sky]]. 
his faithful hounds, [[led]] by the tainted wind, 
lodg'd in thick coverts chanc'd a boar to find. 
the callow hero show'd a manly [[heart]], 
and pierc'd the savage with a side-long dart. 
the flying savage, wounded, turn'd again, 
wrench'd out the gory dart, and foam'd with [[pain]]. 
the trembling boy by flight his safety sought, 
and now recall'd the lore, which [[venus]] taught; 
but now too late to fly the boar he strove, 
who in the groin his tusks impetuous drove, 
on the discolour'd grass adonis lay, 
the monster trampling o'er his beauteous prey. 

fair cytherea, cyprus scarce in view, 
heard from afar his groans, and own'd them true, 
and turn'd her snowy swans, and backward flew. 
but as she saw him gasp his latest breath, 
and quiv'ring agonize in pangs of [[death]], 
down with swift flight she plung'd, nor rage forbore, 
at once her garments, and her hair she tore. 
with cruel blows she beat her guiltless breast, 
the fates [[fate]] upbraided, and her [[love]] confest. 
nor shall they yet (she cry'd) the whole devour 
with uncontroul'd, inexorable pow'r: 
for thee, lost [[youth]], my tears, and restless [[pain]] 
shall in [[immortal]] monuments remain, 
with solemn pomp in annual rites return'd, 
be thou for ever, my adonis, mourn'd, 
could pluto's queen with [[jealous]] fury storm, 
and menthe to a fragrant herb transform? 
yet dares not [[venus]] with a [[change]] surprise, 
and in a flow'r bid her fall'n heroe rise? 
then on the [[blood]] sweet nectar she bestows, 
the scented [[blood]] in little bubbles rose: 
little as rainy drops, which flutt'ring fly, 
born by the winds, along a low'ring [[sky]]. 
short [[time]] ensu'd, 'till where the [[blood]] was shed, 
a flow'r began to rear its purple head: 
such, as on punick apples is reveal'd, 
or in the filmy rind but half conceal'd. 
still here the [[fate]] of lovely forms we see, 
so sudden fades the sweet anemonie. 
the feeble stems, to stormy blasts a prey, 
their sickly beauties [[beauty]] droop, and pine away. 
the winds forbid the flow'rs to flourish long, 
which owe to winds their names in grecian [[song]]. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book the eleventh

the [[death]] of orpheus 

here, while the thracian bard's enchanting strain 
sooths beasts, and woods, and all the listn'ing plain, 
the female bacchanals, devoutly mad, 
in shaggy skins, like savage creatures, clad, 
warbling in air perceiv'd his lovely lay, 
and from a rising ground beheld him play. 
when one, the wildest, with dishevel'd hair, 
that loosely stream'd, and ruffled in the air; 
soon as her frantick eye the lyrist spy'd, 
see, see! the hater of our [[sex]], she cry'd. 
then at his face her missive javelin sent, 
which whiz'd along, and brusht him as it went; 
but the soft wreathes of ivy twisted round, 
prevent a deep impression of the wound. 
another, for a weapon, hurls a stone, 
which, by the sound subdu'd as soon as thrown, 
falls at his feet, and with a seeming sense 
implores his pardon for its late offence. 
but now their frantick rage unbounded grows, 
turns all to madness, and no measure knows [[know]]: 
yet this the charms of musick might subdue, 
but that, with all its charms, is conquer'd too; 
in louder strains their hideous yellings rise, 
and squeaking horn-pipes eccho thro' the skies [[sky]], 
which, in hoarse consort with the drum, confound 
the moving lyre, and ev'ry gentle sound: 
then 'twas the deafen'd stones flew on with speed, 
and saw, unsooth'd, their tuneful poet bleed. 
the birds, the beasts, and all the savage crew 
which the sweet lyrist to attention drew, 
now, by the female mob's more furious rage, 
are driv'n, and forc'd to quit the shady stage. 
next their fierce hands the bard himself assail, 
nor can his [[song]] against their wrath prevail: 
they flock, like birds, when in a clustring flight, 
by day they chase the boding fowl of night. 
so crowded amphitheatres survey 
the stag, to greedy dogs a future prey. 
their steely javelins, which soft curls entwine 
of budding tendrils from the leafy vine, 
for [[sacred]] rites of mild [[religion]] made, 
are flung promiscuous at the poet's head. 
those clods of [[earth]] or flints discharge, and these 
hurl prickly branches sliver'd from the trees. 
and, lest their passion shou'd be unsupply'd, 
the rabble crew, by [[chance]], at distance spy'd 
where oxen, straining at the heavy yoke, 
the fallow'd field with slow advances broke; 
nigh which the brawny peasants dug the soil, 
procuring food with long laborious toil. 
these, when they saw the ranting throng draw near, 
quitted their tools, and fled, possest with [[fear]]. 
long spades, and rakes of mighty size were found, 
carelesly left upon the broken ground. 
with these the furious lunaticks engage, 
and first the lab'ring oxen [[feel]] their rage; 
then to the poet they return with speed, 
whose [[fate]] was, [[past]] prevention, now decreed: 
in [[vain]] he lifts his suppliant hands, in [[vain]] 
he tries, before, his never-failing strain. 
and, from those [[sacred]] lips, whose thrilling sound 
fierce tygers, and insensate rocks cou'd wound, 
ah gods! how moving was the mournful sight! 
to see the fleeting [[soul]] now take its flight. 
thee the soft warblers of the feather'd [[kind]] 
bewail'd; for thee thy savage audience pin'd; 
those rocks and woods that oft thy strain had [[led]], 
mourn for their charmer, and lament him [[dead]]; 
and drooping trees their leafy glories shed. 
naids and dryads with dishevel'd hair 
promiscuous weep, and scarfs of sable wear; 
nor cou'd the river-gods conceal their moan, 
but with new floods of tears augment their own. 
his mangled limbs lay scatter'd all around, 
his head, and harp a [[better]] [[fortune]] found; 
in hebrus' streams they gently roul'd along, 
and sooth'd the waters with a mournful [[song]]. 
soft deadly notes the lifeless tongue inspire, 
a doleful tune sounds from the floating lyre; 
the hollows banks in solemn consort mourn, 
and the [[sad]] strain in ecchoing groans return. 
now with the current to the sea they glide, 
born by the billows of the briny tide; 
and driv'n where waves round rocky lesbos roar, 
they strand, and lodge upon methymna's shore. 

but here, when landed on the [[foreign]] soil, 
a venom'd snake, the product of the isle 
attempts the head, and [[sacred]] locks embru'd 
with clotted gore, and still fresh-dropping [[blood]]. 
phoebus, at [[last]], his [[kind]] protection gives, 
and from the [[fact]] the greedy monster drives: 
whose marbled jaws his impious crime atone, 
still grinning ghastly, tho' transform'd to stone. 

his ghost flies downward to the stygian shore, 
and knows [[know]] the places it had seen before: 
among the shadows of the pious train 
he finds eurydice, and loves [[love]] again; 
with [[pleasure]] views the beauteous phantom's charms, 
and clasps her in his unsubstantial arms. 
there side by side they unmolested walk, 
or pass their blissful hours in pleasing talk; 
aft or before the bard securely goes, 
and, without danger, can review his spouse. 

the thracian [[women]] transform'd to trees 

bacchus, resolving to [[revenge]] the [[wrong]], 
of orpheus murder'd, on the madding throng, 
decreed that each accomplice dame should stand 
fix'd by the roots along the conscious [[land]]. 
their wicked feet, that late so nimbly ran 
to wreak their malice on the guiltless [[man]], 
sudden with twisted ligatures were bound, 
like trees, deep planted in the turfy ground. 
and, as the fowler with his subtle gins, 
his feather'd captives by the feet entwines, 
that flutt'ring pant, and struggle to get loose, 
yet only closer draw the fatal noose; 
so these were caught; and, as they strove in [[vain]] 
to quit the place, they but encreas'd their [[pain]]. 
they flounce and toil, yet find themselves controul'd; 
the root, tho' pliant, toughly keeps its hold. 
in [[vain]] their toes and feet they look to find, 
for ev'n their shapely legs are cloath'd with rind. 
one smites her thighs with a lamenting stroke, 
and finds the flesh transform'd to solid oak; 
another, with surprize, and [[grief]] distrest, 
lays on above, but beats a wooden breast. 
a rugged bark their softer neck invades, 
their branching arms shoot up delightful shades; 
at once they seem, and are, a real grove, 
with mossy trunks below, and verdant leaves above. 

the fable of midas 

nor this suffic'd; the god's disgust remains, 
and he resolves to quit their hated plains; 
the vineyards of tymole ingross his [[care]], 
and, with a [[better]] choir, he fixes there; 
where the smooth streams of clear pactolus roll'd, 
then undistinguish'd for its sands of gold. 
the satyrs with the nymphs [[nymph]], his usual throng, 
come to salute their [[god]], and jovial danc'd along. 
silenus only miss'd; for while he reel'd, 
feeble with [[age]], and wine, about the field, 
the hoary drunkard had forgot his way, 
and to the phrygian clowns became a prey; 
who to [[king]] midas drag the captive [[god]], 
while on his totty pate the wreaths of ivy nod. 

midas from orpheus had been taught his lore, 
and knew the rites of bacchus long before. 
he, when he saw his venerable guest, 
in [[honour]] of the [[god]] ordain'd a feast. 
ten days in course, with each continu'd night, 
were spent in genial mirth, and brisk delight: 
then on th' eleventh, when with brighter ray 
phosphor had chac'd the fading stars away, 
the [[king]] thro' lydia's fields [[young]] bacchus sought, 
and to the [[god]] his foster-father brought. 
pleas'd with the welcome sight, he bids him soon 
but name his [[wish]], and swears to grant the boon. 
a glorious offer! yet but ill bestow'd 
on him whose [[choice]] so little [[judgment]] show'd. 
give me, says he (nor [[thought]] he ask'd too much), 
that with my [[body]] whatsoe'er i touch, 
chang'd from the [[nature]] which it held of old, 
may be converted into yellow gold. 
he had his [[wish]]; but yet the [[god]] repin'd, 
to [[think]] the [[fool]] no [[better]] [[wish]] could find. 

but the brave [[king]] departed from the place, 
with smiles of gladness sparkling in his face: 
nor could contain, but, as he took his way, 
impatient longs to make the first essay. 
down from a lowly branch a twig he drew, 
the twig strait glitter'd with a golden hue: 
he takes a stone, the stone was turn'd to gold; 
a clod he touches, and the crumbling mold 
acknowledg'd soon the [[great]] transforming pow'r, 
in weight and substance like a mass of ore. 
he pluck'd the corn, and strait his grasp appears 
fill'd with a bending tuft of golden ears. 
an apple next he takes, and seems to hold 
the bright hesperian vegetable gold. 
his hand he careless on a pillar lays. 
with shining gold the fluted pillars blaze: 
and while he washes, as the servants pour, 
his touch converts the stream to danae's show'r. 

to see these [[miracles]] so finely wrought, 
fires with transporting joy his giddy [[thought]]. 
the ready slaves [[slave]] prepare a sumptuous board, 
spread with [[rich]] dainties for their [[happy]] [[lord]]; 
whose pow'rful hands the bread no sooner hold, 
but its whole substance is transform'd to gold: 
up to his mouth he lifts the sav'ry meat, 
which turns to gold as he attempts to [[eat]]: 
his patron's [[noble]] juice of purple hue, 
touch'd by his lips, a gilded cordial grew; 
unfit for drink, and wondrous to behold, 
it trickles from his jaws a fluid gold. 

the [[rich]] [[poor]] [[fool]], confounded with surprize, 
starving in all his various plenty lies [[lie]]: 
sick of his [[wish]], he now detests the pow'r, 
for which he ask'd so earnestly before; 
amidst his gold with pinching famine curst; 
and justly tortur'd with an [[equal]] thirst. 
at [[last]] his shining arms to heav'n he rears, 
and in distress, for refuge, flies to pray'rs. 
o [[father]] bacchus, i have sinn'd, he cry'd, 
and foolishly thy gracious gift apply'd; 
thy [[pity]] now, repenting, i implore; 
oh! may i [[feel]] the golden plague no more. 

the hungry wretch, his folly thus confest, 
touch'd the [[kind]] deity's good-natur'd breast; 
the gentle [[god]] annull'd his first decree, 
and from the cruel compact set him [[free]]. 
but then, to cleanse him quite from further harm, 
and to dilute the relicks of the charm, 
he bids him seek the stream that cuts the [[land]] 
nigh where the tow'rs of lydian sardis stand; 
then trace the river to the fountain head, 
and meet it rising from its rocky bed; 
there, as the bubling tide pours forth amain, 
to plunge his [[body]] in, and wash away the stain. 
the [[king]] instructed to the fount retires, 
but with the golden charm the stream inspires: 
for while this quality the [[man]] forsakes, 
an [[equal]] pow'r the limpid water takes; 
informs with veins of gold the neighb'ring [[land]], 
and glides along a bed of golden sand. 

now loathing [[wealth]], th' [[occasion]] of his woes, 
far in the woods he sought a calm repose; 
in caves and grottos, where the nymphs [[nymph]] resort, 
and keep with mountain pan their sylvan court. 
ah! had he left his stupid [[soul]] behind! 
but his condition alter'd not his [[mind]]. 

for where high tmolus rears his shady brow, 
and from his cliffs surveys the seas below, 
in his descent, by sardis bounded here, 
by the small confines of hypaepa there, 
pan to the nymphs [[nymph]] his frolick ditties play'd, 
tuning his reeds beneath the chequer'd shade. 
the nymphs [[nymph]] are pleas'd, the boasting sylvan plays, 
and speaks with slight of [[great]] apollo's lays. 
tmolus was arbiter; the boaster still 
accepts the tryal with unequal [[skill]]. 
the venerable [[judge]] was seated high 
on his own hill, that seem'd to touch the [[sky]]. 
above the whisp'ring trees his head he rears, 
from their encumbring boughs to [[free]] his ears; 
a wreath of oak alone his temples bound, 
the pendant acorns loosely dangled round. 
in me your [[judge]], says he, there's no delay: 
then bids the goatherd [[god]] begin, and play. 
pan tun'd the pipe, and with his rural [[song]] 
pleas'd the low taste of all the vulgar throng; 
such songs [[song]] a vulgar [[judgment]] mostly please, 
midas was there, and midas judg'd with these. 

the mountain sire with grave deportment now 
to phoebus turns his venerable brow: 
and, as he turns, with him the listning wood 
in the same posture of attention stood. 
the [[god]] his own parnassian laurel crown'd, 
and in a wreath his golden tresses bound, 
graceful his purple mantle swept the ground. 
high on the left his iv'ry lute he rais'd, 
the lute, emboss'd with glitt'ring jewels, blaz'd 
in his [[right]] hand he nicely held the quill, 
his easy posture spoke a master's [[skill]]. 
the strings he touch'd with more than [[human]] art [[arts]], 
which pleas'd the judge's ear, and sooth'd his [[heart]]; 
who soon judiciously the palm decreed, 
and to the lute postpon'd the squeaking reed. 

all, with applause, the rightful sentence heard, 
midas alone dissatisfy'd appear'd; 
to him unjustly giv'n the [[judgment]] seems, 
for pan's barbarick notes he most esteems. 
the lyrick [[god]], who [[thought]] his untun'd ear 
deserv'd but ill a [[human]] form to wear, 
of that deprives him, and supplies the place 
with some more fit, and of an ampler space: 
fix'd on his noddle an unseemly pair, 
flagging, and large, and full of whitish hair; 
without a total [[change]] from what he was, 
still in the [[man]] preserves the simple ass. 

he, to conceal the scandal of the deed, 
a purple turbant folds about his head; 
veils the reproach from publick view, and fears [[fear]] 
the laughing [[world]] would spy his monstrous ears. 
one trusty barber-slave, that us'd to dress 
his master's hair, when lengthen'd to excess, 
the mighty secret knew, but knew alone, 
and, tho' impatient, durst not make it known. 
restless, at [[last]], a private place he found, 
then dug a hole, and told it to the ground; 
in a low whisper he reveal'd the case, 
and cover'd in the [[earth]], and silent left the place. 

in [[time]], of trembling reeds a plenteous crop 
from the confided furrow sprouted up; 
which, high advancing with the ripening year, 
made known the tiller, and his fruitless [[care]]: 
for then the rustling blades, and whisp'ring wind, 
to tell th' important secret, both combin'd. 

the building of troy 

phoebus, with full [[revenge]], from tmolus flies, 
darts thro' the air, and cleaves the liquid skies [[sky]]; 
near hellespont he lights [[light]], and treads the plains 
where [[great]] laomedon sole monarch reigns; 
where, built between the two projecting strands, 
to panomphaean jove an altar stands. 
here first aspiring thoughts [[thought]] the [[king]] employ, 
to found the lofty tow'rs of future troy. 
the [[work]], from schemes magnificent begun, 
at vast expence was slowly carry'd on: 
which phoebus seeing, with the trident [[god]] 
who rules [[rule]] the swelling surges with his nod, 
assuming each a mortal shape, combine 
at a set price to finish his design. 
the [[work]] was built; the [[king]] their price denies, 
and his [[injustice]] backs with perjuries. 
this [[neptune]] cou'd not brook, but drove the main, 
a mighty deluge, o'er the phrygian plain: 
'twas all a sea; the waters of the deep 
from ev'ry vale the copious harvest sweep; 
the briny billows overflow the soil, 
ravage the fields, and mock the plowman's toil. 

nor this appeas'd the god's revengeful [[mind]], 
for still a greater plague remains behind; 
a huge sea-monster lodges on the sands, 
and the king's [[daughter]] for his prey demands. 
to him that sav'd the damsel, was decreed 
a set of horses of the sun's fine breed: 
but when alcides from the rock unty'd 
the trembling [[fair]], the ransom was deny'd. 
he, in [[revenge]], the new-built walls attack'd, 
and the twice-perjur'd [[city]] bravely sack'd. 
telamon aided, and in [[justice]] shar'd 
part of the plunder as his due [[reward]]: 
the princess, rescu'd late, with all her charms, 
hesione, was yielded to his arms; 
for peleus, with a goddess-bride, was more 
proud of his spouse, than of his birth before: 
grandsons to jove there might be more than one, 
but he the [[goddess]] had enjoy'd alone. 

the story of thetis and peleus 

for proteus thus to virgin thetis said, 
fair [[goddess]] of the waves, [[consent]] to wed, 
and take some spritely lover to your bed. 
a [[son]] you'll have, the terror of the field, 
to whom in fame, and pow'r his sire shall yield. 

jove, who ador'd the [[nymph]] with boundless [[love]], 
did from his breast the dangerous flame remove. 
he knew the fates [[fate]], nor car'd to raise up one, 
whose fame and greatness should eclipse his own, 
on [[happy]] peleus he bestow'd her charms, 
and bless'd his grandson in the goddess' arms: 

a silent creek thessalia's coast can show; 
two arms project, and shape it like a bow; 
'twould make a bay, but the transparent tide 
does scarce the yellow-gravell'd bottom hide; 
for the quick eye may thro' the liquid wave 
a firm unweedy level beach perceive. 
a grove of fragrant myrtle near it grows, 
whose boughs, tho' thick, a beauteous grot disclose; 
the well-wrought fabrick, to discerning [[eyes]], 
rather by art [[arts]] than [[nature]] seems to rise. 
a bridled dolphin oft [[fair]] thetis bore 
to this her lov'd retreat, her fav'rite shore. 
here peleus seiz'd her, slumbring while she lay, 
and urg'd his suit with all that [[love]] could say: 
but when he found her obstinately coy, 
resolv'd to [[force]] her, and command the joy; 
the [[nymph]], o'erpowr'd, to art [[arts]] for succour flies 
and various shapes the eager [[youth]] surprize: 
a bird she seems, but plies her wings in [[vain]], 
his hands the fleeting substance still detain: 
a branchy tree high in the air she grew; 
about its bark his nimble arms he threw: 
a tyger next she glares with flaming [[eyes]]; 
the frighten'd lover quits his hold, and flies: 
the sea-gods he with [[sacred]] rites adores, 
then a libation on the ocean pours; 
while the fat entrails crackle in the [[fire]], 
and sheets of smoak in sweet perfume aspire; 
'till proteus rising from his oozy bed, 
thus to the [[poor]] desponding lover said: 
no more in anxious thoughts [[thought]] your [[mind]] employ, 
for yet you shall possess the dear expected joy. 
you must once more th' unwary [[nymph]] surprize, 
as in her cooly grot she slumbring lies [[lie]]; 
then bind her fast with unrelenting hands, 
and strain her tender limbs with knotted bands. 
still hold her under ev'ry different shape, 
'till tir'd she tries no longer to escape. 
thus he: then sunk beneath the glassy flood, 
and broken accents flutter'd, where he stood. 

bright sol had almost now his [[journey]] done, 
and down the steepy western convex run; 
when the [[fair]] nereid left the briny wave, 
and, as she us'd, retreated to her cave. 
he scarce had bound her fast, when she arose, 
and into various shapes her [[body]] throws: 
she went to move her arms, and found 'em ty'd; 
then with a sigh, some [[god]] assists ye, cry'd, 
and in her proper shape stood blushing by his side. 
about her waiste his longing arms he flung, 
from which embrace the [[great]] achilles sprung. 

the transformation of daedalion 

peleus unmix'd felicity enjoy'd 
(blest in a valiant [[son]], and [[virtuous]] bride), 
'till [[fortune]] did in [[blood]] his hands imbrue, 
and his own [[brother]] by curst [[chance]] he slew: 
then driv'n from thessaly, his native clime, 
trachinia first gave shelter to his crime; 
where peaceful ceyx mildly fill'd the [[throne]], 
and like his sire, the morning planet, shone; 
but now, unlike himself, bedew'd with tears, 
mourning a [[brother]] lost, his brow appears. 
first to the town with travel spent, and [[care]], 
peleus, and his small company repair: 
his herds, and flocks the while at leisure feed, 
on the [[rich]] pasture of a neighb'ring mead. 
the [[prince]] before the [[royal]] presence brought, 
shew'd by the suppliant olive what he sought; 
then tells his name, and [[race]], and [[country]] [[right]], 
but hides th' unhappy [[reason]] of his flight. 
he begs the [[king]] some little town to give, 
where they may safe his faithful vassals [[live]]. 
ceyx reply'd: to all my bounty flows, 
a hospitable realm your suit has chose. 
your glorious [[race]], and far-resounding fame, 
and grandsire jove, peculiar favours claim. 
all you can [[wish]], i grant; entreaties spare; 
my [[kingdom]] (would 'twere worth the sharing) share. 

tears stop'd his [[speech]]: astonish'd peleus pleads 
to [[know]] the cause from whence his [[grief]] proceeds. 
the [[prince]] reply'd: there's none of ye but deems 
this hawk was ever such as now it seems; 
know 'twas a heroe once, daedalion nam'd, 
for warlike deeds, and haughty valour fam'd; 
like me to that bright luminary born, 
who wakes aurora, and brings on the morn. 
his fierceness still remains, and [[love]] of [[blood]], 
now dread of birds, and [[tyrant]] of the wood. 
my make was softer, [[peace]] my [[greatest]] [[care]]; 
but this my [[brother]] wholly bent on [[war]]; 
late nations fear'd, and routed armies [[army]] fled 
that [[force]], which now the tim'rous pigeons dread. 
a [[daughter]] he possess'd, divinely [[fair]], 
and scarcely yet had seen her fifteenth year; 
young chione: a thousand rivals strove 
to [[win]] the maid, and [[teach]] her how to [[love]]. 
phoebus, and mercury by [[chance]] one day 
from delphi, and cyllene [[past]] this way; 
together they the virgin saw: [[desire]] 
at once warm'd both their breasts with am'rous [[fire]]. 
phoebus resolv'd to wait 'till close of day; 
but mercury's hot [[love]] brook'd no delay; 
with his entrancing rod the maid he charms, 
and unresisted revels in her arms. 
'twas night, and phoebus in a beldam's dress, 
to the late rifled [[beauty]] got access. 
her [[time]] compleat nine circling moons had run; 
to either [[god]] she bore a lovely [[son]]: 
to mercury autolycus she brought, 
who turn'd to thefts and tricks his subtle [[thought]]; 
possess'd he was of all his father's slight, 
at will made [[white]] look black, and black look [[white]]. 
philammon born to phoebus, like his sire, 
the muses lov'd, and finely struck the lyre, 
and made his voice, and touch in harmony conspire. 
in [[vain]], fond maid, you boast this double birth, 
the [[love]] of gods, and [[royal]] father's worth, 
and jove among your [[ancestors]] rehearse! 
could blessings such as these e'er prove a curse? 
to her they did, who with audacious [[pride]], 
vain of her own, diana's charms decry'd. 
her taunts the [[goddess]] with resentment fill; 
my face you like not, you shall try my [[skill]]. 
she said; and strait her vengeful bow she strung, 
and sent a shaft that pierc'd her guilty tongue: 
the bleeding tongue in [[vain]] its accents tries; 
in the red stream her [[soul]] reluctant flies. 
with [[sorrow]] wild i ran to her relief, 
and try'd to moderate my brother's [[grief]]. 
he, deaf as rocks by stormy surges beat, 
loudly laments, and hears me not intreat. 
when on the fun'ral pile he saw her laid, 
thrice he to rush into the flames assay'd, 
thrice with officious [[care]] by us was stay'd. 
now, mad with [[grief]], away he fled amain, 
like a stung heifer that resents the [[pain]], 
and bellowing wildly bounds along the plain. 
o'er the most rugged ways so fast he ran, 
he seem'd a bird already, not a [[man]]: 
he left us breathless all behind; and now 
in quest of [[death]] had gain'd parnassus' brow: 
but when from thence headlong himself he threw, 
he fell not, but with airy pinions flew. 
phoebus in [[pity]] chang'd him to a fowl, 
whose crooked beak and claws the birds controul, 
little of bulk, but of a warlike [[soul]]. 
a hawk become, the feather'd race's foe, 
he tries to case his own by other's woe. 

a wolf turn'd into marble 

while they astonish'd heard the [[king]] relate 
these wonders of his hapless brother's [[fate]]; 
the prince's herdsman at the court arrives, 
and fresh surprize to all the audience gives. 
o peleus, peleus! dreadful news i bear, 
he said; and trembled as he spoke for [[fear]]. 
the worst, affrighted peleus bid him tell, 
whilst ceyx too grew pale with friendly zeal. 
thus he began: when sol mid-heav'n had gain'd, 
and half his way was [[past]], and half remain'd, 
i to the level shore my cattle drove, 
and let them freely in the meadows rove. 
some stretch'd at length [[admire]] the watry plain, 
some crop'd the herb, some wanton swam the main. 
a temple stands of antique make hard by, 
where no gilt domes, nor marble lure the eye; 
unpolish'd rafters bear its lowly height, 
hid by a grove, as ancient, from the sight. 
here nereus, and the nereids they adore; 
i learnt it from the [[man]] who thither bore 
his net, to dry it on the sunny shore. 
adjoyns a lake, inclos'd with willows round, 
where swelling waves have overflow'd the mound, 
and, muddy, stagnate on the lower ground. 
from thence a russling noise increasing flies, 
strikes the still shore; and frights us with surprize, 
strait a huge wolf rush'd from the marshy wood, 
his jaws besmear'd with mingled foam, and [[blood]], 
tho' equally by [[hunger]] urg'd, and rage, 
his appetite he minds [[mind]] not to asswage; 
nought that he meets, his rabid fury spares, 
but the whole herd with mad disorder tears. 
some of our [[men]] who strove to drive him thence, 
torn by his teeth, have dy'd in their defence. 
the echoing lakes, the sea, and fields, and shore, 
impurpled blush with streams of reeking gore. 
delay is loss, nor have we [[time]] for [[thought]]; 
while yet some few remain alive, we ought 
to seize our arms, and with confederate [[force]] 
try if we so can stop his bloody course. 
but peleus car'd not for his ruin'd herd; 
his crime he call'd to [[mind]], and thence inferr'd, 
that psamathe's [[revenge]] this havock made, 
in [[sacrifice]] to murder'd phocus' shade. 
the [[king]] commands his servants to their arms; 
resolv'd to go; but the loud noise alarms 
his lovely queen, who from her chamber flew, 
and her half-plaited hair behind her threw: 
about his neck she hung with loving fears [[fear]], 
and now with words, and now with pleading tears, 
intreated that he'd send his [[men]] alone, 
and stay himself, to save two lives [[life]] in one. 
then peleus: your just fears [[fear]], o queen, forget; 
too much the offer leaves me in your debt. 
no arms against the monster i shall bear, 
but the sea nymphs [[nymph]] appease with humble pray'r. 

the citadel's high turrets pierce the [[sky]], 
which home-bound vessels, glad, from far descry; 
this they ascend, and thence with [[sorrow]] ken 
the mangled heifers lye, and bleeding [[men]]; 
th' inexorable ravager they view, 
with [[blood]] discolour'd, still the rest pursue: 
there peleus pray'd submissive tow'rds the sea, 
and deprecates the ire of injur'd psamathe. 
but deaf to all his pray'rs the [[nymph]] remain'd, 
'till thetis for her spouse the boon obtain'd. 
pleas'd with the luxury, the furious beast, 
unstop'd, continues still his bloody feast: 
while yet upon a sturdy bull he flew, 
chang'd by the [[nymph]], a marble block he grew. 
no longer dreadful now the wolf appears, 
bury'd in stone, and vanish'd like their fears [[fear]]. 
yet still the fates [[fate]] unhappy peleus vex'd; 
to the magnesian shore he wanders next. 
acastus there, who rul'd the peaceful clime, 
grants his request, and expiates his crime. 

the story of ceyx and alcyone 

these prodigies affect the pious [[prince]], 
but more perplex'd with those that happen'd since, 
he purposes [[purpose]] to seek the clarian [[god]], 
avoiding delphi, his more fam'd abode, 
since phlegyan robbers made unsafe the road. 
yet could he not from her he lov'd so well, 
the fatal [[voyage]], he resolv'd, conceal; 
but when she saw her [[lord]] prepar'd to part, 
a deadly cold ran shiv'ring to her [[heart]]; 
her faded cheeks are chang'd to boxen hue, 
and in her [[eyes]] the tears are ever new. 
she thrice essay'd to speak; her accents hung, 
and falt'ring dy'd unfinish'd on her tongue, 
and vanish'd into sighs: with long delay 
her voice return'd, and found the wonted way. 

tell me, my [[lord]], she said, what [[fault]] unknown 
thy once belov'd alcyone has done? 
whither, ah, whither, is thy [[kindness]] gone! 
can ceyx then sustain to leave his [[wife]], 
and unconcern'd forsake the sweets of [[life]]? 
what can thy [[mind]] to this long [[journey]] move? 
or need'st thou absence to renew thy [[love]]? 
yet, if thou go'st by [[land]], tho' [[grief]] possess 
my [[soul]] ev'n then, my fears [[fear]] will be the less. 
but ah! be warn'd to shun the watry way, 
the face is frightful of the stormy sea: 
for late i saw a-drift disjointed planks, 
and empty tombs erected on the banks. 
nor let false hopes [[hope]] to trust betray thy [[mind]], 
because my sire in caves constrains the wind, 
can with a breath their clam'rous rage appease, 
they [[fear]] his whistle, and forsake the seas: 
not so; for once indulg'd, they sweep the main; 
deaf to the call, or hearing, hear in [[vain]]; 
but bent on mischief bear the waves before, 
and not content with seas, insult the shore, 
when ocean, air, and [[earth]], at once ingage, 
and rooted forests fly before their rage: 
at once the clashing clouds to battel move, 
and lightnings run across the fields above: 
i [[know]] them well, and mark'd their rude comport, 
while yet a child within my father's court: 
in times [[time]] of tempest they command alone, 
and he but sits precarious on the [[throne]]: 
the more i [[know]], the more my fears [[fear]] augment; 
and fears [[fear]] are oft prophetick of th' event. 
but if not fears [[fear]], or reasons [[reason]] will prevail, 
if [[fate]] has fix'd thee obstinate to sail, 
go not without thy [[wife]], but let me bear 
my part of danger with an [[equal]] share, 
and [[present]], what i suffer only [[fear]]: 
then o'er the bounding billows shall we fly, 
secure to [[live]] together, or to [[die]]. 

these reasons [[reason]] mov'd her warlike husband's [[heart]], 
but still he held his [[purpose]] to depart: 
for as he lov'd her [[equal]] to his [[life]], 
he would not to the seas expose his [[wife]]; 
nor could be wrought his [[voyage]] to refrain, 
but sought by arguments to sooth her [[pain]]: 
nor these avail'd; at length he lights [[light]] on one, 
with which so difficult a cause he won: 
my [[love]], so short an absence cease to [[fear]], 
for by my father's holy flame i swear, 
before two moons their orb with [[light]] adorn, 
if heav'n allow me [[life]], i will return. 

this promise of so short a stay prevails; 
he soon equips the ship, supplies the sails, 
and gives the word to launch; she trembling views 
this pomp of [[death]], and parting tears renews: 
last with a kiss, she took a long farewel, 
sigh'd with a [[sad]] presage, and swooning fell: 
while ceyx seeks delays, the lusty crew, 
rais'd on their banks, their oars in order drew 
to their broad breasts, the ship with fury flew. 

the queen recover'd, rears her humid [[eyes]], 
and first her husband on the poop espies, 
shaking his hand at distance on the main; 
she took the sign, and shook her hand again. 
still as the ground recedes, contracts her view 
with sharpen'd sight, 'till she no longer knew 
the much-lov'd face; that comfort lost supplies 
with less, and with the galley feeds her [[eyes]]; 
the galley born from view by rising gales, 
she follow'd with her sight the flying sails: 
when ev'n the flying sails were seen no more, 
forsaken of all sight she left the shore. 

then on her bridal bed her [[body]] throws, 
and sought in sleep her wearied [[eyes]] to close: 
her husband's pillow, and the widow'd part 
which once he press'd, renew'd the former smart. 

and now a breeze from shoar began to blow, 
the sailors ship their oars, and cease to row; 
then hoist their yards a-trip, and all their sails 
let fall, to court the wind, and catch the gales: 
by this the vessel half her course had run, 
both shoars were lost to sight, when at the close 
of day a stiffer gale at east arose: 
the sea grew [[white]], the rouling waves from far, 
like heralds, first denounce the watry [[war]]. 

this seen, the master soon began to cry, 
strike, strike the top-sail; let the main-sheet fly, 
and furl your sails: the winds repel the sound, 
and in the speaker's mouth the [[speech]] is drown'd. 
yet of their own accord, as danger taught 
each in his way, officiously they wrought; 
some stow their oars, or stop the leaky sides, 
another bolder, yet the yard bestrides, 
and folds the sails; a fourth with [[labour]] laves 
th' intruding seas, and waves ejects on waves. 

in this confusion while their [[work]] they ply, 
the winds augment the winter of the [[sky]], 
and wage intestine wars [[war]]; the suff'ring seas 
are toss'd, and mingled, as their tyrants [[tyrant]] please. 
the master would command, but in despair 
of safety, stands amaz'd with stupid [[care]], 
nor what to bid, or what forbid he knows [[know]], 
th' ungovern'd tempest to such fury grows: 
vain is his [[force]], and vainer is his [[skill]]; 
with such a concourse comes the flood of ill; 
the cries of [[men]] are mix'd with rattling shrowds; 
seas dash on seas, and clouds encounter clouds: 
at once from east to west, from pole to pole, 
the forky lightnings flash, the roaring thunders roul. 

now waves on waves ascending scale the skies [[sky]], 
and in the fires [[fire]] above the water fries: 
when yellow sands are sifted from below, 
the glittering billows give a golden show: 
and when the fouler bottom spews the black 
the stygian dye the tainted waters take: 
then frothy [[white]] appear the flatted seas, 
and [[change]] their colour, changing their disease, 
like various fits the trachin vessel finds, 
and now sublime, she rides upon the winds; 
as from a lofty summit looks from high, 
and from the clouds beholds the nether [[sky]]; 
now from the depth of hell they lift their sight, 
and at a distance see superior [[light]]; 
the lashing billows make a loud report, 
and beat her sides, as batt'ring rams a fort: 
or as a lion bounding in his way, 
with [[force]] augmented, bears against his prey, 
sidelong to seize; or unapal'd with [[fear]], 
springs on the toils, and rushes on the spear: 
so seas impell'd by winds, with added pow'r 
assault the sides, and o'er the hatches tow'r. 

the planks (their pitchy cov'ring wash'd away) 
now yield; and now a yawning breach display: 
the roaring waters with a hostile tide 
rush through the ruins of her gaping side. 
mean-time in sheets of rain the [[sky]] descends, 
and ocean swell'd with waters upwards tends; 
one rising, falling one, the heav'ns and sea 
meet at their confines, in the middle way: 
the sails are drunk with show'rs, and drop with rain, 
sweet waters mingle with the briny main. 
no star appears to lend his friendly [[light]]; 
darkness, and tempest make a double night; 
but flashing fires [[fire]] disclose the deep by turns, 
and while the lightnings blaze, the water burns. 

now all the waves their scatter'd [[force]] unite, 
and as a soldier foremost in the [[fight]], 
makes way for others, and an host alone 
still presses on, and urging gains the town; 
so while th' invading billows come a-breast, 
the hero tenth advanc'd before the rest, 
sweeps all before him with impetuous sway, 
and from the walls descends upon the prey; 
part following enter, part remain without, 
with envy hear their fellows' conqu'ring shout, 
and mount on others' backs, in hopes [[hope]] to share 
the [[city]], thus become the seat of [[war]]. 

an universal cry resounds aloud, 
the sailors run in heaps, a helpless crowd; 
art fails, and [[courage]] falls, no succour near; 
as many waves, as many deaths [[death]] appear. 
one weeps, and yet despairs of late relief; 
one cannot weep, his fears [[fear]] congeal his [[grief]], 
but stupid, with dry [[eyes]] expects his [[fate]]: 
one with loud shrieks laments his lost estate, 
and calls those [[happy]] whom their fun'rals wait. 
this wretch with pray'rs and vows the gods implores, 
and ev'n the skies [[sky]] he cannot see, adores. 
that other on his [[friends]] his thoughts [[thought]] bestows, 
his careful [[father]], and his faithful spouse. 
the covetous worldling in his anxious [[mind]], 
thinks only on the [[wealth]] he left behind. 

all ceyx his alcyone employs, 
for her he grieves, yet in her absence joys: 
his [[wife]] he wishes [[wish]], and would still be near, 
not her with him, but wishes [[wish]] him with her: 
now with [[last]] looks he seeks his native shoar, 
which [[fate]] has destin'd him to see no more; 
he sought, but in the dark tempestuous night 
he knew not whither to direct his sight. 
so whirl the seas, such darkness blinds the [[sky]], 
that the black night receives a deeper dye. 

the giddy ship ran round; the tempest tore 
her mast, and over-board the rudder bore. 
one billow mounts, and with a scornful brow, 
proud of her [[conquest]] gain'd, insults the waves below; 
nor lighter falls, than if some giant tore 
pindus and athos with the freight they bore, 
and toss'd on seas; press'd with the pond'rous blow, 
down sinks the ship within th' abyss below: 
down with the vessel sink into the main 
the many, never more to rise again. 
some few on scatter'd planks, with fruitless [[care]], 
lay hold, and swim; but while they swim, despair. 

ev'n he who late a scepter did command, 
now grasps a floating fragment in his hand; 
and while he struggles on the stormy main, 
invokes his [[father]], and his wife's, in [[vain]]. 
but yet his consort is his [[greatest]] [[care]], 
alcyone he names amidst his pray'r; 
names as a charm against the waves and wind; 
most in his mouth, and ever in his [[mind]]. 
tir'd with his toil, all hopes [[hope]] of safety [[past]], 
from pray'rs to wishes [[wish]] he descends at [[last]]; 
that his [[dead]] [[body]], wafted to the sands, 
might have its burial from her friendly hands, 
as oft as he can catch a gulp of air, 
and peep above the seas, he names the [[fair]]; 
and ev'n when plung'd beneath, on her he raves, 
murm'ring alcyone below the waves: 
at [[last]] a falling billow stops his breath, 
breaks o'er his head, and whelms him underneath. 
that night, his heav'nly form obscur'd with tears, 
and since he was forbid to leave the skies [[sky]], 
he muffled with a cloud his mournful [[eyes]]. 

mean-time alcyone (his [[fate]] unknown) 
computes how many nights he had been gone. 
observes the waining moon with hourly view, 
numbers her [[age]], and wishes [[wish]] for a new; 
against the promis'd [[time]] provides with [[care]], 
and hastens in the woof the robes he was to wear: 
and for her [[self]] employs another loom, 
new-dress'd to meet her [[lord]] returning [[home]], 
flatt'ring her [[heart]] with joys, that never were to come:

she fum'd the temples with an od'rous flame, 
and oft before the [[sacred]] altars came, 
to [[pray]] for him, who was an empty name. 
all pow'rs implor'd, but far above the rest 
to juno she her pious vows address'd, 
her much-lov'd [[lord]] from perils to [[protect]], 
and safe o'er seas his [[voyage]] to direct: 
then pray'd, that she might still possess his [[heart]], 
and no pretending rival share a part; 
this [[last]] petition heard of all her pray'r, 
the rest, dispers'd by winds, were lost in air. 

but she, the [[goddess]] of the nuptial bed, 
tir'd with her [[vain]] devotions for the [[dead]], 
resolv'd the tainted hand should be repell'd, 
which incense offer'd, and her altar held: 
then iris thus bespoke: thou faithful maid, 
by whom thy queen's commands are well convey'd, 
haste to the house of sleep, and bid the [[god]] 
who rules [[rule]] the night by visions with a nod, 
prepare a [[dream]], in figure, and in form 
resembling him, who perish'd in the storm; 
this form before alcyone [[present]], 
to make her [[certain]] of the [[sad]] event. 

indu'd with robes of various hue she flies, 
and flying draws an arch (a segment of the skies): 
then leaves her bending bow, and from the steep 
descends, to search the silent house of sleep. 

the house of sleep 

near the cymmerians, in his dark abode, 
deep in a cavern, dwells the drowzy [[god]]; 
whose gloomy mansion nor the rising sun, 
nor setting, visits, nor the lightsome noon; 
but lazy vapours round the region fly, 
perpetual twilight, and a doubtful [[sky]]: 
no crowing cock does there his wings display, 
nor with his horny bill provoke the day; 
nor watchful dogs, nor the more wakeful geese, 
disturb with nightly noise the [[sacred]] [[peace]]; 
nor beast of [[nature]], nor the tame are nigh, 
nor trees with tempests rock'd, nor [[human]] cry; 
but safe repose without an air of breath 
dwells here, and a dumb quiet next to [[death]]. 

an arm of lethe, with a gentle flow 
arising upwards from the rock below, 
the palace moats, and o'er the pebbles creeps, 
and with soft murmurs calls the coming sleeps. 
around its entry nodding poppies grow, 
and all cool simples that sweet rest bestow; 
night from the plants their sleepy [[virtue]] drains, 
and passing, sheds it on the silent plains: 
no door there was th' unguarded house to keep, 
on creaking hinges turn'd, to break his sleep. 

but in the gloomy court was rais'd a bed, 
stuff'd with black plumes, and on an ebon-sted: 
black was the cov'ring too, where lay the [[god]], 
and slept supine, his limbs display'd abroad: 
about his head fantastick visions fly, 
which various images of things supply, 
and mock their forms; the leaves on trees not more, 
nor bearded ears in fields, nor sands upon the shore. 

the virgin ent'ring bright, indulg'd the day 
to the brown cave, and brush'd the dreams [[dream]] away: 
the [[god]] disturb'd with this new glare of [[light]], 
cast sudden on his face, unseal'd his sight, 
and rais'd his tardy head, which sunk again, 
and sinking, on his bosom knock'd his chin; 
at length shook off himself, and ask'd the dame, 
(and asking yawn'd) for what intent she came. 

to whom the [[goddess]] thus: o [[sacred]] rest, 
sweet pleasing sleep, of all the pow'rs the best! 
o [[peace]] of [[mind]], repairer of decay, 
whose balms renew the limbs to labours [[labour]] of the day, 
care shuns thy soft approach, and sullen flies away! 
adorn a [[dream]], expressing [[human]] form, 
the shape of him who suffer'd in the storm, 
and send it flitting to the trachin court, 
the wreck of wretched ceyx to report: 
before his queen bid the pale spectre stand, 
who begs a [[vain]] relief at juno's hand. 
she said, and scarce awake her [[eyes]] could keep, 
unable to support the fumes of sleep; 
but fled, returning by the way she went, 
and swerv'd along her bow with swift ascent. 

the [[god]], uneasy 'till he slept again, 
resolv'd at once to rid himself of [[pain]]; 
and, tho' against his custom, call'd aloud, 
exciting morpheus from the sleepy crowd: 
morpheus, of all his numerous train, express'd 
the shape of [[man]], and imitated [[best]]; 
the walk, the words, the gesture could supply, 
the habit mimick, and the mein bely; 
plays well, but all his action is confin'd, 
extending not beyond our [[human]] [[kind]]. 
another, birds, and beasts, and dragons apes, 
and dreadful images, and monster shapes: 
this demon, icelos, in heav'n's high hall 
the gods have nam'd; but [[men]] phobetor call. 
a third is phantasus, whose actions roul 
on meaner thoughts [[thought]], and things devoid of [[soul]]; 
earth, fruits, and flow'rs he represents in dreams [[dream]], 
and solid rocks unmov'd, and running streams. 
these three to kings [[king]], and chiefs [[chief]] their scenes display, 
the rest before th' ignoble commons [[common]] play. 
of these the chosen morpheus is dispatch'd; 
which done, the lazy monarch, over-watch'd, 
down from his propping elbow drops his head, 
dissolv'd in sleep, and shrinks within his bed. 

darkling the demon glides, for flight prepar'd, 
so soft, that scarce his fanning wings are heard. 
to trachin, swift as [[thought]], the flitting shade, 
thro' air his momentary [[journey]] made: 
then lays aside the steerage of his wings, 
forsakes his proper form, assumes the king's; 
and pale, as [[death]], despoil'd of his array, 
into the queen's apartment takes his way, 
and stands before the bed at dawn of day: 
unmov'd his [[eyes]], and wet his beard appears; 
and shedding [[vain]], but seeming real tears; 
the briny waters dropping from his hairs. 
then staring on her with a ghastly look, 
and hollow voice, he thus the queen bespoke. 

know'st thou not me? not yet, unhappy [[wife]]? 
or are my features perish'd with my [[life]]? 
look once again, and for thy husband lost, 
lo all that's left of him, thy husband's ghost! 
thy vows for my return were all in [[vain]], 
the stormy south o'ertook us in the main, 
and never shalt thou see thy living [[lord]] again. 
bear witness, heav'n, i call'd on thee in [[death]], 
and while i call'd, a billow stop'd my breath. 
think not, that flying fame reports my [[fate]]; 
i [[present]], i appear, and my own wreck relate. 
rise, wretched widow, rise; nor undeplor'd 
permit my [[soul]] to pass the stygian ford; 
but rise, prepar'd in black, to mourn thy perish'd [[lord]].

thus said the player-god; and adding art [[arts]] 
of voice and gesture, so perform'd his part, 
she [[thought]] (so like her [[love]] the shade appears) 
that ceyx spake the words, and ceyx shed the tears; 
she groan'd, her inward [[soul]] with [[grief]] opprest, 
she sigh'd, she wept, and sleeping beat her breast; 
then stretch'd her arms t' embrace his [[body]] bare; 
her clasping arms inclose but empty air: 
at this, not yet awake, she cry'd, o stay; 
one is our [[fate]], and [[common]] is our way! 

so dreadful was the [[dream]], so loud she spoke, 
that starting sudden up, the slumber broke: 
then cast her [[eyes]] around, in [[hope]] to view 
her vanish'd [[lord]], and find the vision true: 
for now the maids, who waited her commands, 
ran in with lighted tapers in their hands. 
tir'd with the search, not finding what she seeks, 
with cruel blows she pounds her blubber'd cheeks; 
then from her beaten breast the linnen tare, 
and cut the golden caul that bound her hair. 
her nurse demands the cause; with louder cries 
she prosecutes her griefs, and thus replies. 

no more alcyone; she suffer'd [[death]] 
with her lov'd [[lord]], when ceyx lost his breath: 
no flatt'ry, no false comfort, give me none, 
my shipwreck'd ceyx is for ever gone: 
i saw, i saw him manifest in view, 
his voice, his figure, and his gestures knew: 
his lustre lost, and ev'ry living grace, 
yet i retain'd the features of his face; 
tho' with pale cheeks, wet beard, and dropping hair, 
none but my ceyx could appear so [[fair]]: 
i would have strain'd him with a strict embrace, 
but thro' my arms he slipt, and vanish'd from the place:

there, ev'n just there he stood; and as she spoke, 
where [[last]] the spectre was she cast her look: 
fain would she [[hope]], and gaz'd upon the ground, 
if any printed footsteps might be found. 

then sigh'd, and said: this i too well foreknew, 
and my prophetick fears [[fear]] presag'd too true: 
'twas what i begg'd, when with a bleeding [[heart]] 
i took my leave, and suffer'd thee to part; 
or i to go along, or thou to stay, 
never, ah never to divide our way! 
happier for me, that all our hours assign'd 
together we had liv'd; ev'n not in [[death]] disjoin'd! 
so had my ceyx still been living here, 
or with my ceyx i had perish'd there: 
now i [[die]] absent, in the vast profound; 
and me, without my [[self]], the seas have drown'd. 
the storms were not so cruel: should i strive 
to lengthen [[life]], and such a [[grief]] survive; 
but neither will i strive, nor wretched thee 
in [[death]] forsake, but keep thee company. 
if not one [[common]] sepulchre contains 
our bodies [[body]], or one urn our [[last]] remains, 
yet ceyx and alcyone shall join, 
their names remember'd in one [[common]] line. 

no farther voice her mighty [[grief]] affords, 
for sighs come rushing in betwixt her words, 
and stop'd her tongue; but what her tongue deny'd, 
soft tears, and groans, and dumb complaints supply'd. 

'twas morning; to the port she takes her way, 
and stands upon the margin of the sea: 
that place, that very spot of ground she sought, 
or thither by her [[destiny]] was brought, 
where [[last]] he stood: and while she sadly said, 
'twas here he left me, lingring here delay'd 
his parting kiss, and there his anchors weigh'd. 

thus speaking, while her thoughts [[thought]] [[past]] actions trace, 
and call to [[mind]], admonish'd by the place, 
sharp at her utmost ken she cast her [[eyes]], 
and somewhat floating from afar descries: 
it seems a corps a-drift to distant sight, 
but at a distance who could [[judge]] aright? 
it wafted nearer yet, and then she knew, 
that what before she but surmis'd, was true: 
a corps it was, but whose it was, unknown, 
yet mov'd, howe'er, she made the cause her own. 
took the [[bad]] omen of a shipwreck'd [[man]], 
as for a stranger wept, and thus began. 

poor wretch, on stormy seas to lose thy [[life]], 
unhappy thou, but more thy widow'd [[wife]]; 
at this she paus'd: for now the flowing tide 
had brought the [[body]] nearer to the side: 
the more she looks, the more her fears [[fear]] increase, 
at nearer sight; and she's her [[self]] the less: 
now driv'n ashore, and at her feet it lies [[lie]], 
she knows [[know]] too much in knowing whom she sees: 
her husband's corps; at this she loudly shrieks, 
'tis he, 'tis he, she cries, and tears her cheeks, 
her hair, and vest; and stooping to the sands, 
about his neck she cast her trembling hands. 

and is it thus, o dearer than my [[life]], 
thus, thus return'st thou to thy longing wife! 
she said, and to the neighbouring mole she strode, 
(rais'd there to break th' incursions of the flood). 

headlong from hence to plunge her [[self]] she springs, 
but shoots along, supported on her wings; 
a bird new-made, about the banks she plies, 
not far from shore, and short excursions tries; 
nor seeks in air her humble flight to raise, 
content to skim the surface of the seas: 
her bill tho' slender, sends a creaking noise, 
and imitates a lamentable voice. 
now lighting where the bloodless [[body]] lies [[lie]], 
she with a fun'ral note renews her cries: 
at all her stretch, her little wings she spread, 
and with her feather'd arms embrac'd the [[dead]]: 
then flick'ring to his palid lips, she strove 
to print a kiss, the [[last]] essay of [[love]]. 
whether the vital touch reviv'd the [[dead]], 
or that the moving waters rais'd his head 
to meet the kiss, the vulgar [[doubt]] alone; 
for sure a [[present]] miracle was shown. 
the gods their shapes to winter-birds translate, 
but both obnoxious to their former [[fate]]. 
their conjugal affection still is ty'd, 
and still the mournful [[race]] is multiply'd: 
they bill, they tread; alcyone compress'd, 
sev'n days sits brooding on her floating nest: 
a wintry queen: her sire at length is [[kind]], 
calms ev'ry storm, and hushes ev'ry wind; 
prepares his [[empire]] for his daughter's ease, 
and for his hatching nephews smooths the seas. 

aesacus transform'd into a cormorant 

these some old [[man]] sees wanton in the air, 
and praises [[praise]] the unhappy constant pair. 
then to his friend the long-neck'd corm'rant shows, 
the former tale reviving others' woes: 
that sable bird, he cries, which cuts the flood 
with slender legs, was once of [[royal]] [[blood]]; 
his [[ancestors]] from mighty tros proceed, 
the brave laomedon, and ganymede 
(whose [[beauty]] tempted jove to steal the boy), 
and priam, hapless prince! who fell with troy: 
himself was hector's [[brother]], and (had [[fate]] 
but giv'n this hopeful [[youth]] a longer date) 
perhaps had rival'd warlike hector's worth, 
tho' on the mother's side of meaner birth; 
fair alyxothoe, a [[country]] maid, 
bare aesacus by stealth in ida's shade. 
he fled the noisy town, and pompous court, 
lov'd the lone hills, and simple rural [[sport]]. 
and seldom to the [[city]] would resort. 
yet he no rustick clownishness profest, 
nor was soft [[love]] a stranger to his breast: 
the [[youth]] had long the [[nymph]] hesperie woo'd, 
oft thro' the thicket, or the mead pursu'd: 
her haply on her father's bank he spy'd, 
while fearless she her silver tresses dry'd; 
away she fled: not stags with half such speed, 
before the prowling wolf, scud o'er the mead; 
not ducks, when they the safer flood forsake, 
pursu'd by hawks, so swift regain the lake. 
as fast he follow'd in the hot [[career]]; 
desire the lover wing'd, the virgin [[fear]]. 
a snake unseen now pierc'd her heedless foot; 
quick thro' the veins the venom'd juices shoot: 
she fell, and 'scap'd by [[death]] his fierce pursuit; 
her lifeless [[body]], frighted, he embrac'd, 
and cry'd, not this i dreaded, but thy haste: 
o had my [[love]] been less, or less thy fear! 
the [[victory]], thus bought, is far too dear. 
accursed snake! yet i more curs'd than he! 
he gave the wound; the cause was given by me. 
yet none shall say, that unreveng'd you dy'd. 
he spoke; then climb'd a cliff's o'er-hanging side, 
and, resolute, leap'd on the foaming tide. 
tethys receiv'd him gently on the wave; 
the [[death]] he sought deny'd, and feathers gave. 
debarr'd the surest remedy of [[grief]], 
and forc'd to [[live]], he curst th' unask'd relief. 
then on his airy pinions upward flies, 
and at a second fall successless tries; 
the downy plume a quick descent denies. 
enrag'd, he often dives beneath the wave, 
and there in [[vain]] expects to find a grave. 
his ceaseless [[sorrow]] for th' unhappy maid, 
meager'd his look, and on his spirits prey'd. 
still near the sounding deep he lives [[life]]; his name 
from frequent diving and emerging came.

book the twelfth

the trojan [[war]] 

priam, to whom the story was unknown, 
as [[dead]], deplor'd his metamorphos'd [[son]]: 
a cenotaph his name, and title kept, 
and [[hector]] round the tomb, with all his brothers [[brother]], wept. 
this pious office [[paris]] did not share; 
absent alone; and author of the [[war]], 
which, for the spartan queen, the grecians drew 
t' avenge the rape; and [[asia]] to subdue. 
a thousand ships were mann'd, to sail the sea: 
nor had their just resentments found delay, 
had not the winds, and waves oppos'd their way. 
at aulis, with [[united]] pow'rs they meet, 
but there, cross-winds or calms detain'd the fleet. 
now, while they raise an altar on the shore, 
and jove with solemn [[sacrifice]] adore; 
a boding sign the priests [[priest]] and [[people]] see: 
a snake of size immense ascends a tree, 
and, in the leafie summit, spy'd a nest, 
which o'er her callow [[young]], a sparrow press'd. 
eight were the birds unfledg'd; their [[mother]] flew, 
and hover'd round her [[care]]; but still in view: 
'till the fierce reptile first devour'd the brood, 
then seiz'd the flutt'ring dam, and drunk her [[blood]]. 
this dire ostent, the fearful [[people]] view; 
calchas alone, by phoebus taught, foreknew 
what heav'n decreed; and with a smiling glance, 
thus gratulates to greece her [[happy]] [[chance]]: 
o argives, we shall conquer: troy is ours, 
but long delays shall first afflict our pow'rs: 
nine years of [[labour]], the nine birds portend; 
the tenth shall in the town's destruction end. 

the serpent, who his maw obscene had fill'd, 
the branches in his curl'd embraces held: 
but, as in spires he stood, he turn'd to stone: 
the stony snake retain'd the figure still his own. 

yet, not for this, the wind-bound navy weigh'd; 
slack were their sails; and [[neptune]] disobey'd. 
some [[thought]] him loth the town should be destroy'd, 
whose building had his hands [[divine]] employ'd: 
not so the seer; who knew, and known foreshow'd, 
the virgin phoebe, with a virgin's [[blood]] 
must first be reconcil'd: the [[common]] cause 
prevail'd; and [[pity]] yielding to the laws [[law]], 
fair iphigenia the devoted maid 
was, by the weeping priests [[priest]], in linnen-robes array'd; 
all mourn her [[fate]]; but no relief appear'd; 
the [[royal]] victim bound, the knife already rear'd: 
when that offended pow'r, who caus'd their woe, 
relenting ceas'd her wrath; and stop'd the coming blow. 
a mist before the ministers she cast, 
and, in the virgin's room, a hind she plac'd. 
th' oblation slain, and phoebe, reconcil'd, 
the storm was hush'd, and dimpled ocean smil'd: 
a favourable gale arose from shore, 
which to the port desir'd, the graecian gallies bore. 

the house of fame 

full in the midst of this created space, 
betwixt heav'n, [[earth]], and skies [[sky]], there stands a place, 
confining on all three, with triple bound; 
whence all things, tho' remote, are view'd around; 
and thither bring their undulating sound. 
the palace of loud fame, her seat of pow'r, 
plac'd on the summet of a lofty tow'r; 
a thousand winding entries long and wide, 
receive of fresh reports a flowing tide. 
a thousand crannies in the walls are made; 
nor gate, nor bars exclude the busie [[trade]]. 
'tis built of brass, the [[better]] to diffuse 
the spreading sounds, and multiply the news: 
where eccho's in repeated eccho's play: 
a mart for ever full, and open night and day. 
nor [[silence]] is within, nor voice express, 
but a deaf noise of sounds, that never cease. 
confus'd and chiding, like the hollow roar 
of tides, receding from th' insulted shore, 
or like the broken thunder heard from far, 
when jove at distance drives the rouling [[war]]. 
the courts are fill'd with a tumultuous din 
of crouds, or issuing forth, or entring in: 
a thorough-fare of news: where some devise 
things never heard, some mingle [[truth]] with lies [[lie]]; 
the troubled air with empty sounds they beat, 
intent to hear, and eager to repeat. 
error sits brooding there, with added train 
of [[vain]] credulity, and joys as [[vain]]: 
suspicion, with sedition join'd, are near, 
and rumours rais'd, and murmurs mix'd, and panique [[fear]].

fame sits aloft, and sees the [[subject]] ground, 
and seas about, and skies [[sky]] above; enquiring all around. 

the [[goddess]] gives th' alarm; and soon is known 
the grecian fleet descending on the town. 
fix'd on defence, the trojans are not slow 
to guard their shore, from an expected foe. 
they meet in [[fight]]: by hector's fatal hand 
protesilaus falls, and bites the strand: 
which with expence of [[blood]] the grecians won; 
and prov'd the [[strength]] unknown of priam's [[son]]. 
and to their cost the trojan leaders [[felt]] 
the grecian heroes; and what deaths [[death]] they dealt. 

the story of cygnus 

from these first onsets, the sigaean shore 
was strew'd with carcasses, and stain'd with gore: 
neptunian cygnus [[troops]] of greeks [[greek]] had slain; 
achilles in his carr had scour'd the plain, 
and clear'd the trojan ranks: where-e'er he fought, 
cygnus, or [[hector]], through the fields he sought: 
cygnus he found; on him his [[force]] essay'd: 
for [[hector]] was to the tenth year delay'd. 
his white-main'd steeds, that bow'd beneath the yoke, 
he chear'd to [[courage]], with a gentle stroke; 
then urg'd his fiery chariot on the foe; 
and rising shook his lance; in act to throw. 
but first he cry'd, o [[youth]], be proud to bear 
thy [[death]], ennobled by pelides' spear. 
the lance pursu'd the voice without delay, 
nor did the whizzing weapon miss the way; 
but pierc'd his cuirass, with such fury sent, 
and sign'd his bosom with a purple dint. 
at this the seed of [[neptune]]: goddess-born, 
for ornament, not use, these arms are worn; 
this helm, and heavy buckler, i can spare; 
as only decorations of the [[war]]: 
so [[mars]] is arm'd for [[glory]], not for need. 
'tis somewhat more from [[neptune]] to proceed, 
than from a [[daughter]] of the sea to spring: 
thy sire is mortal; mine is ocean's [[king]]. 
secure of [[death]], i shou'd contemn thy dart, 
tho' naked; and impassible depart: 
he said, and threw: the trembling weapon pass'd 
through nine bull-hides, each under other plac'd, 
on his broad shield; and stuck within the [[last]]. 
achilles wrench'd it out; and sent again 
the hostile gift: the hostile gift was [[vain]]. 
he try'd a third, a tough well-chosen spear; 
th' inviolable [[body]] stood sincere, 
though cygnus then did no defence provide, 
but scornful offer'd his unshielded side. 

not otherwise th' impatient hero far'd, 
than as a bull incompass'd with a guard, 
amid the circus roars, provok'd from far 
by sight of scarlet, and a sanguine [[war]]: 
they quit their ground, his bended horns elude; 
in [[vain]] pursuing, and in [[vain]] pursu'd: 

before to farther [[fight]] he wou'd advance, 
he stood considering, and survey'd his lance. 
doubts if he wielded not a wooden spear 
without a point: he look'd, the point was there. 
this is my hand, and this my lance, he said; 
by which so many thousand foes are [[dead]], 
o whither is their usual [[virtue]] fled! 
i had it once; and the lyrnessian wall, 
and tenedos, confess'd it in their fall. 
thy streams, caicus, rowl'd a crimson-flood; 
and thebes ran red with her own natives' [[blood]]. 
twice telephus employ'd their piercing steel, 
to wound him first, and afterward to heal. 
the vigour of this arm was never [[vain]]: 
and that my wonted prowess i retain, 
witness these heaps of slaughter on the plain. 
he said; and, doubtful of his former deeds, 
to some new tryal of his [[force]] proceeds. 
he chose menoetes from among the rest; 
at him he launch'd his spear, and pierc'd his breast: 
on the hard [[earth]] the lycian knock'd his head, 
and lay supine; and forth the spirit fled. 

then thus the hero: neither can i blame 
the hand, or jav'lin; both are still the same. 
the same i will employ against this foe, 
and [[wish]] but with the same [[success]] to throw. 
so spoke the [[chief]]; and while he spoke he threw; 
the weapon with unerring fury flew, 
at his left shoulder aim'd: nor entrance found; 
but back, as from a rock, with swift rebound 
harmless return'd: a bloody mark appear'd, 
which with false joy the flatter'd hero chear'd. 
wound there was none; the [[blood]] that was in view, 
the lance before from slain menoetes drew. 

headlong he leaps from off his lofty car, 
and in close [[fight]] on foot renews the [[war]]. 
raging with high disdain, repeats his blows; 
nor shield, nor armour can their [[force]] oppose; 
huge cantlets of his buckler strew the ground, 
and no defence in his bor'd arms is found, 
but on his flesh, no wound or [[blood]] is seen; 
the [[sword]] it [[self]] is blunted on the skin. 

this [[vain]] attempt the [[chief]] no longer bears; 
but round his hollow temples and his ears 
his buckler beats: the [[son]] of [[neptune]], stunn'd 
with these repeated buffets, quits his ground; 
a sickly sweat succeeds, and shades of night; 
inverted [[nature]] swims before his sight: 
th' insulting victor presses on the more, 
and treads the steps the vanquish'd trod before, 
nor rest, nor respite gives. a stone there lay 
behind his trembling foe, and stopp'd his way: 
achilles took th' advantage which he found, 
o'er-turn'd, and push'd him backward on the ground, 
his buckler held him under, while he press'd, 
with both his knees, above his panting breast. 
unlac'd his helm: about his chin the twist 
he ty'd; and soon the strangled [[soul]] dismiss'd. 

with eager haste he went to strip the [[dead]]: 
the vanish'd [[body]] from his arms was fled. 
his sea-god sire, t' immortalize his frame, 
had turn'd it to a bird that bears his name. 

a truce succeeds the labours [[labour]] of this day, 
and arms suspended with a long delay. 
while trojan walls are kept with watch and ward; 
the greeks [[greek]] before their trenches mount the guard; 
the feast approach'd; when to the blue-ey'd maid 
his vows for cygnus slain the victor paid, 
and a [[white]] heyfer on her altar laid. 
the reeking entrails on the [[fire]] they threw, 
and to the gods the grateful odour flew. 
heav'n had its part in [[sacrifice]]: the rest 
was broil'd, and roasted for the future feast. 
the chief-invited guests were set around! 
and [[hunger]] first asswag'd, the bowls were crown'd, 
which in deep draughts their cares [[care]], and labours [[labour]] drown'd.

the mellow harp did not their ears employ: 
and mute was all the warlike symphony: 
discourse, the food of souls [[soul]], was their delight, 
and pleasing chat prolong'd the summer's night. 
the [[subject]], deeds of arms; and valour shown, 
or on the trojan side, or on their own. 
of dangers undertaken, fame atchiev'd, 
they talk'd by turns; the talk by turns reliev'd. 
what things but these could fierce achilles tell, 
or what cou'd fierce achilles hear so well? 
the [[last]] [[great]] act perform'd, of cygnus slain, 
did most the martial audience entertain: 
wondring to find a [[body]] [[free]] by [[fate]] 
from steel; and which cou'd ev'n that steel rebate: 
amaz'd, their admiration they renew; 
and scarce pelides cou'd [[believe]] it true. 

the story of caeneus 

then nestor thus: what once this [[age]] has known, 
in fated cygnus, and in him alone, 
these [[eyes]] have seen in caeneus long before; 
whose [[body]] not a thousand swords [[sword]] cou'd bore. 
caeneus, in [[courage]], and in [[strength]], excell'd; 
and still his othrys with his fame is fill'd: 
but what did most his martial deeds adorn 
(though since he chang'd his sex) a woman born. 

a novelty so [[strange]], and full of [[fate]], 
his list'ning audience ask'd him to relate. 
achilles thus commends their [[common]] sute: 
o [[father]], first for prudence in repute, 
tell, with that eloquence, so much thy own, 
what thou hast heard, or what of caeneus known: 
what was he, whence his [[change]] of [[sex]] begun, 
what trophies, join'd in wars [[war]] with thee, he won? 
who conquer'd him, and in what fatal strife 
the [[youth]], without a wound, cou'd lose his [[life]]? 

neleides then: though tardy [[age]], and [[time]], 
have shrunk my sinews, and decay'd my prime; 
though much i have forgotten of my store, 
yet not exhausted, i [[remember]] more. 
of all that arms atchiev'd, or [[peace]] design'd, 
that action still is fresher in my [[mind]], 
than ought beside. if reverend [[age]] can give 
to [[faith]] a sanction, in my third i [[live]]. 

'twas in my second cent'ry, i survey'd 
young caenis, then a [[fair]] thessalian maid: 
caenis the bright, was born to high command; 
a princess, and a native of thy [[land]], 
divine achilles; every tongue proclaim'd 
her [[beauty]], and her [[eyes]] all hearts [[heart]] inflam'd. 
peleus, thy sire, perhaps had sought her bed, 
among the rest; but he had either [[led]] 
thy [[mother]] then; or was by promise ty'd; 
but she to him, and all, alike her [[love]] deny'd. 

it was her [[fortune]] once to take her way 
along the sandy margin of the sea: 
the pow'r of ocean view'd her as she pass'd, 
and, lov'd as soon as seen, by [[force]] embrac'd. 
so fame reports. her virgin-treasure seiz'd, 
and his new joys, the ravisher so pleas'd, 
that thus, transported, to the [[nymph]] he cry'd; 
ask what thou wilt, no pray'r shall be deny'd. 
this also fame relates: the haughty [[fair]], 
who not the rape ev'n of a [[god]] cou'd bear, 
this [[answer]], proud, return'd: to mighty wrongs [[wrong]] 
a mighty recompence, of [[right]], belongs. 
give me no more to suffer such a shame; 
but [[change]] the woman, for a [[better]] name; 
one gift for all: she said; and while she spoke, 
a stern, majestick, manly tone she took. 
a [[man]] she was: and as the godhead swore, 
to caeneus turn'd, who caenis was before. 

to this the lover adds, without request, 
no [[force]] of steel shou'd violate his breast. 
glad of the gift, the new-made warrior goes; 
and arms among the greeks [[greek]], and longs for [[equal]] foes. 

the skirmish between the centaurs and lapithites 

now brave perithous, bold ixion's [[son]], 
the [[love]] of [[fair]] hippodame had won. 
the cloud-begotten [[race]], half [[men]], half beast, 
invited, came to grace the nuptial feast: 
in a cool cave's recess the treat was made, 
whose entrance, trees with spreading boughs o'er-shade 
they sate: and summon'd by the bridegroom, came, 
to mix with those, the lapythaean name: 
nor wanted i: the roofs with joy resound: 
and hymen, io hymen, rung around. 
rais'd altars shone with holy fires [[fire]]; the bride, 
lovely her [[self]] (and lovely by her side 
a bevy of bright nymphs [[nymph]], with sober grace), 
came glitt'ring like a star, and took her place. 
her heav'nly form beheld, all wish'd her joy; 
and little wanted; but in [[vain]], their wishes [[wish]] all employ.

for one, most brutal, of the brutal brood, 
or whether wine, or [[beauty]] fir'd his [[blood]], 
or both at once, beheld with lustful [[eyes]] 
the bride; at once resolv'd to make his prize. 
down went the board; and fastning on her hair, 
he seiz'd with sudden [[force]] the frighted [[fair]]. 
'twas eurytus began: his bestial [[kind]] 
his crime pursu'd; and each as pleas'd his [[mind]], 
or her, whom [[chance]] presented, took: the feast 
an image of a taken town express'd. 

the cave resounds with female shrieks; we rise, 
mad with [[revenge]] to make a swift reprise: 
and theseus first, what phrenzy has possess'd, 
o eurytus, he cry'd, thy brutal breast, 
to [[wrong]] perithous, and not him alone, 
but while i [[live]], two [[friends]] conjoyn'd in one? 

to justifie his threat, he thrusts aside 
the crowd of centaurs; and redeems the bride: 
the monster nought reply'd: for words were [[vain]], 
and deeds cou'd only deeds [[unjust]] maintain; 
but answers [[answer]] with his hand, and forward press'd, 
with blows redoubled, on his face, and breast. 
an ample goblet stood, of antick mold, 
and rough with figures of the rising gold; 
the hero snatch'd it up, and toss'd in air 
full at the front of the foul ravisher. 
he falls; and falling vomits forth a flood 
of wine, and foam, and brains, and mingled [[blood]]. 
half roaring, and half neighing through the hall, 
arms, arms, the double-form'd with fury call; 
to wreak their brother's [[death]]: a medley-flight 
of bowls, and jars, at first supply the [[fight]], 
once instruments of feasts; but now of [[fate]]; 
wine animates their rage, and arms their hate. 

bold amycus, from the robb'd vestry brings 
the chalices of heav'n; and holy things 
of precious weight: a sconce that hung on high, 
with tapers fill'd, to [[light]] the sacristy, 
torn from the cord, with his unhallow'd hand 
he threw amid the lapythaean band. 
on celadon the ruin fell; and left 
his face of feature, and of form bereft: 
so, when some brawny sacrificer knocks, 
before an altar [[led]], an offer'd ox, 
his eyes-balls rooted out, are thrown to ground; 
his nose, dismantled, in his mouth is found; 
his jaws, cheeks, front, one undistinguish'd wound. 

this, belates, th' avenger, cou'd not brook; 
but, by the foot, a maple board he took; 
and hurl'd at amycus; his chin it bent 
against his chest, and down the centaur sent: 
whom sputtring bloody teeth, the second blow 
of his drawn [[sword]], dispatch'd to shades below. 

grineus was near; and cast a furious look 
on the side-altar, cens'd with [[sacred]] smoke, 
and bright with flaming fires [[fire]]; the gods, he cry'd, 
have with their holy [[trade]] our hands supply'd: 
why use we not their gifts? then from the floor 
an altar stone he heav'd, with all the load it bore: 
altar, and altar's freight together slew, 
where thickest throng'd the lapythaean crew: 
and, at once, broteas and oryus flew. 
oryus' [[mother]], mycale, was known 
down from her sphere to draw the lab'ring moon. 

exadius cry'd, unpunish'd shall not go 
this [[fact]], if arms are found against the foe. 
he look'd about, where on a pine were spread 
the votive horns of a stag's branching head: 
at grineus these he throws; so just they fly, 
that the sharp antlers stuck in either eye: 
breathless, and blind he fell; with [[blood]] besmear'd; 
his eye-balls beaten out, hung dangling on his beard. 
fierce rhoetus, from the hearth a burning brand 
selects, and whirling waves; 'till, from his hand 
the [[fire]] took flame; then dash'd it from the [[right]], 
on [[fair]] charaxus' temples, near the sight: 
the whistling pest came on, and pierc'd the bone, 
and caught the yellow hair, that shrivel'd while it shone.

caught, like dry stubble fir'd; or like seerwood; 
yet from the wound ensu'd no purple flood; 
but look'd a bubbling mass of frying [[blood]]. 
his blazing locks sent forth a crackling sound; 
and hiss'd, like red hot ir'n within the smithy drown'd.

the wounded warrior shook his flaming hair, 
then (what a team of horse could hardly rear) 
he heaves the threshold stone, but could not throw; 
the weight itself forbad the threaten'd blow; 
which dropping from his lifted arms, came down 
full on cometes' head; and crush'd his [[crown]]. 
nor rhoetus then retain'd his joy; but said, 
so by their fellows may our foes be sped; 
then, with redoubled strokes he plies his head: 
the burning lever not deludes his pains [[pain]]: 
but drives the batter'd skull within the brains. 

thus flush'd, the conqueror, with [[force]] renew'd, 
evagrus, dryas, corythus, pursu'd: 
first, corythus, with downy cheeks, he slew; 
whose fall, when fierce evagrus had in view, 
he cry'd, what palm is from a beardless prey? 
rhoetus prevents what more he had to say; 
and drove within his mouth the fi'ry [[death]], 
which enter'd hissing in, and choak'd his breath. 
at dryas next he flew: but weary [[chance]], 
no longer wou'd the same [[success]] advance. 
for while he whirl'd in fiery circles round 
the brand, a sharpen'd stake [[strong]] dryas found; 
and in the shoulder's joint inflicts the wound. 
the weapon stuck; which, roaring out with [[pain]], 
he drew; nor longer durst the [[fight]] maintain, 
but turn'd his back, for [[fear]]; and fled amain. 
with him fled orneus, with like dread possess'd, 
thaumas, and medon wounded in the breast; 
and mermeros, in the late [[race]] renown'd, 
now limping ran, and tardy with his wound. 
pholus, and melaneus from [[fight]] withdrew, 
and abas maim'd, who boars encountring slew: 
and augur asbolos, whose art [[arts]] in [[vain]], 
from [[fight]] dissuaded the four-footed train, 
now beat the hoof with nessus on the plain; 
but to his fellow cry'd, be safely slow, 
thy [[death]] deferr'd is due to [[great]] alcides' bow. 

mean-time [[strong]] dryas urg'd his [[chance]] so well, 
that lycidas, areos, imbreus fell; 
all, one by one, and fighting face to face: 
crenaeus fled, to fall with more disgrace: 
for, fearful, while he look'd behind, he bore, 
betwixt his nose, and front, the blow before. 
amid the noise, and tumult of the fray, 
snoring, and drunk with wine, aphidas lay. 
ev'n then the bowl within his hand he kept, 
and on a bear's rough hide securely slept. 
him phorbas with his flying dart transfix'd; 
take thy next draught, with stygian waters mix'd, 
and sleep thy fill, th' insulting victor cry'd; 
surpriz'd with [[death]] unfelt, the centaur dy'd; 
the ruddy vomit, as he breath'd his [[soul]] 
repass'd his throat, and fill'd his empty bowl. 

i saw petraeus' arms employ'd around 
a well-grown oak, to root it from the ground. 
this way, and that, he wrench'd the fibrous bands; 
the trunk was like a sappling, in his hands, 
and still obey'd the bent: while thus he stood, 
perithous' dart drove on; and nail'd him to the wood; 
lycus, and chromis fell, by him oppress'd: 
helops, and dictis added to the rest 
a nobler palm: helops, through either ear 
transfix'd, receiv'd the penetrating spear. 
this dictis saw; and, seiz'd with sudden fright, 
leapt headlong from the hill of steepy height; 
and crush'd an ash beneath, that cou'd not bear his weight.

the shatter'd tree receives his fall; and strikes, 
within his full-blown paunch, the sharpen'd spikes. 
strong aphareus had heav'd a mighty stone, 
the fragment of a rock; and wou'd have thrown; 
but theseus, with a club of harden'd oak, 
the cubit-bone of the bold centaur broke; 
and left him maim'd; nor seconded the stroke. 
then leapt on tall bianor's back (who bore 
no mortal burden but his own, before); 
press'd with his knees his sides; the double [[man]], 
his speed with spurs increas'd, unwilling ran. 
one hand the hero fastn'd on his locks; 
his other ply'd him with repeated strokes. 
the club rung round his ears, and batter'd brows; 
he falls; and lashing up his heels, his rider throws. 

the same herculean arms, nedymnus wound; 
and lay by him lycotas on the ground, 
and hippasus, whose beard his breast invades; 
and ripheus, haunter of the woodland shades: 
and thereus, us'd with mountain-bears to strive, 
and from their dens to draw th' indignant beasts alive. 

demoleon cou'd not bear this hateful sight, 
or the long [[fortune]] of th' athenian knight: 
but pull'd with all his [[force]], to disengage 
from [[earth]] a pine, the product of an [[age]]: 
the root stuck fast: the broken trunk he sent 
at theseus; theseus frustrates his intent, 
and leaps aside; by pallas warn'd, the blow 
to shun (for so he said; and we believ'd it so). 
yet not in [[vain]] th' enormous weight was cast; 
which crantor's [[body]] sunder'd at the waist: 
thy father's 'squire, achilles, and his [[care]]; 
whom conquer'd in the polopeian [[war]], 
their [[king]], his [[present]] ruin to prevent, 
a pledge of [[peace]] implor'd, to peleus sent. 

thy sire, with grieving [[eyes]], beheld his [[fate]]; 
and cry'd, not long, lov'd crantor, shalt thou wait 
thy vow'd [[revenge]]. at once he said, and threw 
his ashen-spear; which quiver'd, as it flew; 
with all his [[force]], and all his [[soul]] apply'd; 
the sharp point enter'd in the centaur's side: 
both hands, to wrench it out, the monster join'd; 
and wrench'd it out; but left the steel behind; 
stuck in his lungs it stood: inrag'd he rears 
his hoofs, and down to ground thy [[father]] bears. 
thus trampled under foot, his shield defends 
his head; his other hand the lance portends. 
ev'n while he lay extended on the dust, 
he sped the centaur, with one [[single]] thrust. 
two more his lance before transfix'd from far; 
and two, his [[sword]] had slain, in closer [[war]]. 
to these was added dorylas, who spread 
a bull's two goring horns around his head. 
with these he push'd; in [[blood]] already dy'd, 
him fearless, i approach'd; and thus defy'd: 
now, monster, now, by proof it shall appear, 
whether thy horns are sharper, or my spear. 
at this, i threw: for want of other ward, 
he lifted up his hand, his front to guard. 
his hand it pass'd; and fix'd it to his brow: 
loud shouts of ours attend the lucky blow. 
him peleus finish'd, with a second wound, 
which thro' the navel pierc'd: he reel'd around; 
and dragg'd his dangling bowels on the ground. 
trod what he drag'd; and what he trod, he crush'd: 
and to his mother-earth, with empty belly, rush'd. 

the story of cyllarus and hylonome 

nor cou'd thy form, o cyllarus, foreflow 
thy [[fate]] (if form to monsters [[men]] allow): 
just bloom'd thy beard: thy beard of golden hue: 
thy locks, in golden waves, about thy shoulders flew. 
sprightly thy look: thy shapes in ev'ry part 
so clean, as might instruct the sculptor's art [[arts]]; 
as far as [[man]] extended: where began 
the beast, the beast was [[equal]] to the [[man]]. 
add but a horse's head and neck; and he, 
o castor, was a courser worthy thee. 
so was his back proportion'd for the seat: 
so rose his brawny chest; so swiftly mov'd his feet. 
coal-black his colour, but like jett it shone; 
his legs, and flowing tail were [[white]] alone. 
belov'd by many maidens of his [[kind]]; 
but [[fair]] hylonome possess'd his [[mind]]; 
hylonome, for features, and for face, 
excelling all the nymphs [[nymph]] of double [[race]]: 
nor less her blandishments, than [[beauty]], move; 
at once both loving, and confessing [[love]]. 
for him she dress'd: for him, with female [[care]] 
she comb'd, and set in curls, her auburn hair. 
of roses, violets, and lillies mix'd, 
and sprigs of flowing rosemary betwixt, 
she form'd the chaplet, that adorn'd her front: 
in waters of the pegasaean fount, 
and in the streams that from the fountain play, 
she wash'd her face; and bath'd her twice a-day. 
the scarf of furs, that hung below her side, 
was ermin, or the panther's spotted [[pride]]; 
spoils of no [[common]] beast: with [[equal]] flame 
they lov'd: their silvan pleasures [[pleasure]] were the same: 
all day they hunted: and when day expir'd, 
together to some shady cave retir'd: 
invited to the nuptials, both repair: 
and, side by side, they both engage in [[war]]. 

uncertain from what hand, a flying dart 
at cyllarus was sent; which pierc'd his [[heart]]. 
the jav'lin drawn from out the mortal wound, 
he faints with stagg'ring steps; and seeks the ground: 
the [[fair]] within her arms receiv'd his fall, 
and strove his wand'ring spirits to recall: 
and while her hand the streaming [[blood]] oppos'd, 
join'd face to face, his lips with hers she clos'd. 
stifled with kisses, a sweet [[death]] he dies; 
she fills the fields with undistinguish'd cries; 
at least her words were in her clamour drown'd; 
for my stunn'd ears receiv'd no vocal sound. 
in madness of her [[grief]], she seiz'd the dart 
new-drawn, and reeking from her lover's [[heart]]; 
to her bare bosom the sharp point apply'd; 
and wounded fell; and falling by his side, 
embrac'd him in her arms; and thus embracing dy'd. 

ev'n still methinks, i see phaeocomes; 
strange was his habit, and as odd his dress. 
six lions' hides, with thongs together fast, 
his upper part defended to his waist: 
and where [[man]] ended, the continued vest, 
spread on his back, the houss and trappings of a beast. 
a stump too heavy for a team to draw 
(it seems a fable, tho' the [[fact]] i saw); 
he threw at pholon; the descending blow 
divides the skull, and cleaves his head in two. 
the brains, from nose, and mouth, and either ear, 
came issuing out, as through a colendar 
the curdled milk; or from the press the whey, 
driv'n down by weight above, is drain'd away. 

but him, while stooping down to spoil the slain, 
pierc'd through the paunch, i tumbled on the plain. 
then chthonyus, and teleboas i slew: 
a fork the former arm'd; a dart his fellow threw. 
the jav'lin wounded me (behold the scar, 
then was my [[time]] to seek the trojan [[war]]; 
then i was hector's match in open field; 
but he was then unborn; at least a child: 
now, i am nothing). i forbear to tell 
by periphantas how pyretus fell; 
the centaur by the knight: nor will i stay 
on amphix, or what deaths [[death]] he dealt that day: 
what [[honour]], with a pointless lance, he won, 
stuck in the front of a four-footed [[man]]. 
what fame [[young]] macareus obtain'd in [[fight]]: 
or dwell on nessus, now return'd from flight. 
how [[prophet]] mopsus not alone divin'd, 
whose valour equal'd his foreseeing [[mind]]. 

caeneus transform'd to an eagle 

already caeneus, with his conquering hand, 
had slaughter'd five the boldest of their band. 
pyrachmus, helymus, antimachus, 
bromus the brave, and stronger stiphelus, 
their names i number'd, and [[remember]] well, 
no trace remaining, by what wounds they fell. 

laitreus, the bulki'st of the double [[race]], 
whom the spoil'd arms of slain halesus grace, 
in years retaining still his youthful might, 
though his black hairs were interspers'd with [[white]], 
betwixt th' imbattled ranks began to prance, 
proud of his helm, and macedonian lance; 
and rode the ring around; that either hoast 
might hear him, while he made this empty boast: 
and from a strumpet shall we suffer shame? 
for caenis still, not caeneus, is thy name: 
and still the native softness of thy [[kind]] 
prevails; and leaves the woman in thy [[mind]]; 
remember what thou wert; what price was paid 
to [[change]] thy [[sex]]; to make thee not a maid: 
and but a [[man]] in shew; go, card and spin; 
and leave the [[business]] of the [[war]] to [[men]]. 

while thus the boaster exercis'd his [[pride]], 
the fatal spear of caeneus reach'd his side: 
just in the mixture of the kinds [[kind]] it ran; 
betwixt the neather beast, and upper [[man]]: 
the monster mad with rage, and stung with smart, 
his lance directed at the hero's [[heart]]: 
it struck; but bounded from his harden'd breast, 
like hail from tiles, which the safe house invest. 
nor seem'd the stroke with more effect to come, 
than a small pebble falling on a drum. 
he next his fauchion try'd, in closer [[fight]]; 
but the keen fauchion had no pow'r to bite. 
he thrust; the blunted point return'd again: 
since downright blows, he cry'd, and thrusts are [[vain]], 
i'll prove his side; in [[strong]] embraces held 
he prov'd his side; his side the [[sword]] repell'd: 
his hollow belly eccho'd to the stroke, 
untouch'd his [[body]], as a solid rock; 
aim'd at his neck at [[last]], the blade in shivers broke. 

th' impassive knight stood idle, to deride 
his rage, and offer'd oft his naked side; 
at length, now monster, in thy turn, he cry'd, 
try thou the [[strength]] of caeneus: at the word 
he thrust; and in his shoulder plung'd the [[sword]]. 
then writh'd his hand; and as he drove it down, 
deep in his breast, made many wounds in one. 

the centaurs saw, inrag'd, th' unhop'd [[success]]; 
and rushing on in crowds, together press; 
at him, and him alone, their darts they threw: 
repuls'd they from his fated [[body]] flew. 
amaz'd they stood; 'till monichus began, 
o shame, a nation conquer'd by a man! 
a woman-man! yet more a [[man]] is he, 
than all our [[race]]; and what he was, are we. 
now, what avail our nerves? th' [[united]] [[force]], 
of two the strongest creatures, [[man]] and horse; 
nor goddess-born; nor of ixion's seed 
we seem (a lover built for juno's bed); 
master'd by this half [[man]]. whole mountains throw 
with woods at once, and bury him below. 
this only way remains. nor need we [[doubt]] 
to choak the [[soul]] within; though not to [[force]] it out: 
heap weights, instead of wounds. he chanc'd to see 
where southern storms had rooted up a tree; 
this, rais'd from [[earth]], against the foe he threw; 
th' [[example]] shewn, his fellow-brutes pursue. 
with forest-loads the warrior they invade; 
othrys, and pelion soon were void of shade; 
and spreading groves were naked mountains made. 
press'd with the burden, caeneus pants for breath; 
and on his shoulders bears the wooden [[death]]. 
to heave th' intolerable weight he tries; 
at length it rose above his mouth and [[eyes]]: 
yet still he heaves; and, strugling with despair, 
shakes all aside, and gains a gulp of air: 
a short relief, which but prolongs his [[pain]]; 
he faints by fits; and then respires again: 
at [[last]], the burden only nods above, 
as when an earthquake stirs th' idaean grove. 
doubtful his [[death]]: he suffocated seem'd, 
to most; but otherwise our mopsus deem'd, 
who said he saw a yellow bird arise 
from out the piles, and cleave the liquid skies [[sky]]: 
i saw it too, with golden feathers bright; 
nor e'er before beheld so [[strange]] a sight. 
whom mopsus viewing, as it soar'd around 
our troop, and heard the pinions' rattling sound, 
all hail, he cry'd, thy country's grace and love! 
once first of [[men]] below, now first of birds above. 
its author to the story gave [[belief]]: 
for us, our [[courage]] was increas'd by [[grief]]: 
asham'd to see a [[single]] [[man]], pursu'd 
with odds, to sink beneath a multitude, 
we push'd the foe: and forc'd to shameful flight, 
part fell, and part escap'd by favour of the night. 

the [[fate]] of periclymenos 

this tale, by nestor told, did much displease 
tlepolemus, the seed of hercules: 
for, often he had heard his [[father]] say, 
that he himself was [[present]] at the fray; 
and more than shar'd the glories of the day. 

old chronicle, he said, among the rest, 
you might have nam'd alcides at the least: 
is he not worth your [[praise]]? the pylian [[prince]] 
sigh'd ere he spoke; then made this proud defence. 
my former woes in long oblivion drown'd, 
i wou'd have lost; but you renew the wound: 
better to pass him o'er, than to relate 
the cause i have your mighty sire to hate. 
his fame has fill'd the [[world]], and reach'd the [[sky]] 
(which, oh, i [[wish]], with [[truth]], i cou'd deny!); 
we [[praise]] not [[hector]]; though his name, we [[know]], 
is [[great]] in arms; 'tis hard to [[praise]] a foe. 

he, your [[great]] [[father]], levell'd to the ground 
messenia's tow'rs: nor [[better]] [[fortune]] found 
elis, and pylos; that a neighb'ring [[state]], 
and this my own: both guiltless of their [[fate]]. 

to pass the rest, twelve, wanting one, he slew; 
my brethren [[brother]], who their birth from neleus drew, 
all youths [[youth]] of early promise, had they liv'd; 
by him they perish'd: i alone surviv'd. 
the rest were easie [[conquest]]: but the [[fate]] 
of periclymenos, is wondrous to relate. 
to him, our [[common]] grandsire of the main 
had giv'n to [[change]] his form, and chang'd, resume again.

vary'd at [[pleasure]], every shape he try'd; 
and in all beasts, alcides still defy'd: 
vanquish'd on [[earth]], at length he soar'd above; 
chang'd to the bird, that bears the bolt of jove: 
the new-dissembled eagle, now endu'd 
with beak, and pounces, hercules pursu'd, 
and cuff'd his manly cheeks, and tore his face; 
then, safe retir'd, and tour'd in empty space. 
alcides bore not long his flying foe; 
but bending his inevitable bow, 
reach'd him in air, suspended as he stood; 
and in his pinion fix'd the feather'd wood. 
light was the wound; but in the sinew hung 
the point, and his disabled wing unstrung. 
he wheel'd in air, and stretch'd his vans in [[vain]]; 
his vans no longer cou'd his flight sustain: 
for while one gather'd wind, one unsupply'd 
hung drooping down, nor pois'd his other side. 
he fell: the shaft that slightly was impress'd, 
now from his heavy fall with weight increas'd, 
drove through his neck, aslant, he spurns the ground, 
and the [[soul]] issues through the weazon's wound. 

now, brave commander of the rhodian seas, 
what [[praise]] is due from me, to hercules? 
silence is all the vengeance i decree 
for my slain brothers [[brother]]; but 'tis [[peace]] with thee. 

thus with a flowing tongue old nestor spoke: 
then, to full bowls each other they provoke: 
at length, with weariness, and wine oppress'd, 
they rise from table; and withdraw to rest. 

the [[death]] of achilles 

the sire of cygnus, monarch of the main, 
mean-time, laments his [[son]], in battel slain, 
and vows the victor's [[death]]; nor vows in [[vain]]. 
for nine long years the smother'd [[pain]] he bore 
(achilles was not ripe for [[fate]] before): 
then when he saw the promis'd hour was near, 
he thus bespoke the [[god]], that guides the year: 
immortal offspring of my [[brother]] jove; 
my brightest nephew, and whom [[best]] i [[love]], 
whose hands were join'd with mine, to raise the wall 
of tott'ring troy, now nodding to her fall, 
dost thou not mourn our pow'r employ'd in [[vain]]; 
and the defenders of our [[city]] slain? 
to pass the rest, could [[noble]] [[hector]] [[lie]] 
unpity'd, drag'd around his native troy? 
and yet the murd'rer lives [[life]]: himself by far 
a greater plague, than all the wasteful [[war]]: 
he lives [[life]]; the proud pelides lives [[life]], to boast 
our town destroy'd, our [[common]] [[labour]] lost. 
o, could i meet him! but i [[wish]] too late: 
to prove my trident is not in his fate! 
but let him try (for that's allow'd) thy dart, 
and pierce his only penetrable part. 

apollo bows to the superior [[throne]]; 
and to his uncle's anger, adds his own. 
then in a cloud involv'd, he takes his flight, 
where greeks [[greek]], and trojans mix'd in mortal [[fight]]; 
and found out [[paris]], lurking where he stood, 
and stain'd his arrows with plebeian [[blood]]: 
phoebus to him alone the [[god]] confess'd, 
then to the recreant knight, he thus address'd. 
dost thou not blush, to spend thy shafts in [[vain]] 
on a degenerate, and ignoble train? 
if fame, or [[better]] vengeance be thy [[care]], 
there aim: and, with one arrow, end the [[war]]. 

he said; and shew'd from far the blazing shield 
and [[sword]], which, but achilles, none cou'd wield; 
and how he mov'd a [[god]], and mow'd the standing field. 
the deity himself directs aright 
th' invenom'd shaft; and wings the fatal flight. 

thus fell the foremost of the grecian name; 
and he, the base adult'rer, boasts the fame. 
a spectacle to glad the trojan train; 
and please old priam, after [[hector]] slain. 
if by a female hand he had foreseen 
he was to [[die]], his [[wish]] had rather been 
the lance, and double ax of the [[fair]] warriour queen. 
and now the terror of the trojan field, 
the grecian [[honour]], ornament, and shield, 
high on a pile, th' unconquer'd [[chief]] is plac'd, 
the [[god]] that arm'd him first, consum'd at [[last]]. 
of all the mighty [[man]], the small remains 
a little urn, and scarcely fill'd, contains. 
yet [[great]] in [[homer]], still achilles lives [[life]]; 
and [[equal]] to himself, himself survives. 

his buckler owns its former [[lord]]; and brings 
new cause of strife, betwixt contending kings [[king]]; 
who worthi'st after him, his [[sword]] to wield, 
or wear his armour, or sustain his shield. 
ev'n diomede sat mute, with down-cast [[eyes]]; 
conscious of wanted worth to [[win]] the prize: 
nor menelaus presum'd these arms to claim, 
nor he the [[king]] of [[men]], a greater name. 
two rivals only rose: laertes' [[son]], 
and the vast bulk of ajax telamon: 
the [[king]], who cherish'd each with [[equal]] [[love]], 
and from himself all envy wou'd remove, 
left both to be determin'd by the laws [[law]]; 
and to the graecian chiefs [[chief]] transferr'd the cause. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book the thirteenth

the speeches [[speech]] of ajax and [[ulysses]] 

the chiefs [[chief]] were set; the soldiers crown'd the field: 
to these the master of the seven-fold shield 
upstarted fierce: and kindled with disdain. 
eager to speak, unable to contain 
his boiling rage, he rowl'd his [[eyes]] around 
the shore, and graecian gallies hall'd a-ground. 
then stretching out his hands, o jove, he cry'd, 
must then our cause before the fleet be try'd? 
and dares [[ulysses]] for the prize contend, 
in sight of what he durst not once defend? 
but basely fled that memorable day, 
when i from hector's hands redeem'd the flaming prey. 
so much 'tis safer at the noisie bar 
with words to flourish, than ingage in [[war]]. 
by diff'rent methods we maintain our [[right]], 
nor am i made to talk, nor he to [[fight]]. 
in bloody fields i [[labour]] to be [[great]]; 
his arms are a smooth tongue, and soft deceit: 
nor need i speak my deeds, for those you see, 
the sun, and day are witnesses for me. 
let him who fights unseen, relate his own, 
and vouch the silent stars, and conscious moon. 
great is the prize demanded, i confess, 
but such an abject rival makes it less; 
that gift, those honours [[honour]], he but hop'd to gain, 
can leave no room for ajax to be [[vain]]: 
losing he wins, because his name will be 
ennobled by defeat, who durst contend with me. 
were my known valour question'd, yet my [[blood]] 
without that plea wou'd make my title [[good]]: 
my sire was telamon, whose arms, employ'd 
with hercules, these trojan walls destroy'd; 
and who before with jason sent from greece, 
in the first ship brought [[home]] the golden fleece. 
great telamon from aeacus derives 
his birth (th' inquisitor of guilty lives [[life]] 
in shades below; where sisyphus, whose [[son]] 
this thief is [[thought]], rouls up the restless heavy stone),

just aeacus, the [[king]] of gods above 
begot: thus ajax is the third from jove. 
nor shou'd i seek advantage from my line, 
unless (achilles) it was mix'd with thine: 
as next of kin, achilles' arms i claim; 
this fellow wou'd ingraft a [[foreign]] name 
upon our stock, and the sisyphian seed 
by fraud, and theft asserts his father's breed: 
then must i lose these arms, because i came 
to [[fight]] uncall'd, a voluntary name, 
nor shunn'd the cause, but offer'd you my aid? 
while he long lurking was to [[war]] betray'd: 
forc'd to the field he came, but in the reer; 
and feign'd distraction to conceal his [[fear]]: 
'till one more cunning caught him in the snare 
(ill for himself); and dragg'd him into [[war]]. 
now let a hero's arms a [[coward]] vest, 
and he who shunn'd all honours [[honour]], gain the [[best]]: 
and let me stand excluded from my [[right]], 
robb'd of my kinsman's arms, who first appear'd in [[fight]],

better for us, at [[home]] had he remain'd, 
had it been true the madness which he feign'd, 
or so believ'd; the less had been our shame, 
the less his counsell'd crime, which brands the grecian name;

nor philoctetes had been left inclos'd 
in a bare isle, to wants and pains [[pain]] expos'd, 
where to the rocks, with solitary groans, 
his suff'rings, and our baseness he bemoans: 
and wishes [[wish]] (so may heav'n his [[wish]] fulfill) 
the due [[reward]] to him, who caus'd his ill. 
now he, with us to troy's destruction sworn, 
our [[brother]] of the [[war]], by whom are born 
alcides' arrows, pent in narrow bounds, 
with cold and [[hunger]] pinch'd, and pain'd with wounds, 
to find him food and cloathing, must employ 
against the birds the shafts due to the [[fate]] of troy. 
yet still he lives [[life]], and lives [[life]] from [[treason]] [[free]], 
because he left ulysses' company; 
poor palamede might [[wish]], so void of aid, 
rather to have been left, than so to [[death]] betray'd. 
the [[coward]] bore the [[man]] [[immortal]] spight, 
who sham'd him out of madness into [[fight]]: 
nor daring otherwise to vent his hate, 
accus'd him first of [[treason]] to the [[state]]; 
and then for proof produc'd the golden store, 
himself had hidden in his tent before: 
thus of two champions he depriv'd our host, 
by [[exile]] one, and one by [[treason]] lost. 
thus fights [[ulysses]], thus his fame extends, 
a formidable [[man]], but to his [[friends]]: 
great, for what greatness is in words, and sound, 
ev'n faithful nestor less in both is found: 
but that he might without a rival reign, 
he left this faithful nestor on the plain; 
forsook his friend ev'n at his utmost need, 
who tir'd, and tardy with his wounded steed, 
cry'd out for aid, and call'd him by his name; 
but cowardice has neither ears nor shame; 
thus fled the [[good]] old [[man]], bereft of aid, 
and, for as much as lay in him, betray'd: 
that this is not a fable forg'd by me, 
like one of his, an ulyssean [[lie]], 
i vouch ev'n diomede, who tho' his friend, 
cannot that act excuse, much less defend: 
he call'd him back aloud, and tax'd his [[fear]]; 
and sure enough he heard, but durst not hear. 

the gods with [[equal]] [[eyes]] on mortal look, 
he justly was forsaken, who forsook: 
wanted that succour, he refus'd to lend, 
found ev'ry fellow such another friend: 
no wonder, if he roar'd that all might hear; 
his elocution was increas'd by [[fear]]: 
i heard, i ran, i found him out of breath, 
pale, trembling, and half [[dead]] with [[fear]] of [[death]]. 
though he had judg'd himself by his own laws [[law]], 
and stood condemn'd, i help'd the [[common]] cause: 
with my broad buckler hid him from the foe 
(ev'n the shield trembled as he lay below); 
and from impending [[fate]] the [[coward]] freed: 
good heav'n [[forgive]] me for so [[bad]] a deed! 
if still he will persist, and urge the strife, 
first let him give me back his forfeit [[life]]: 
let him return to that opprobrious field; 
again creep under my protecting shield: 
let him [[lie]] wounded, let the foe be near, 
and let his quiv'ring [[heart]] confess his [[fear]]; 
there put him in the very jaws of [[fate]]; 
and let him plead his cause in that estate: 
and yet when snatch'd from [[death]], when from below 
my lifted shield i loos'd, and let him go; 
good heav'ns, how [[light]] he rose, with what a bound 
he sprung from [[earth]], forgetful of his wound; 
how fresh, how eager then his feet to ply; 
who had not [[strength]] to stand, had speed to fly! 

hector came on, and brought the gods along; 
fear seiz'd alike the feeble, and the [[strong]]: 
each [[greek]] was an [[ulysses]]; such a dread 
th' approach, and ev'n the sound of [[hector]] bred: 
him, flesh'd with slaughter, and with [[conquest]] crown'd, 
i met, and over-turn'd him to the ground; 
when after, matchless as he deem'd in might, 
he challeng'd all our host to [[single]] [[fight]]; 
all [[eyes]] were fix'd on me: the lots were thrown; 
but for your champion i was wish'd alone: 
your vows were heard; we fought, and neither yield; 
yet i return'd unvanquish'd from the field. 
with jove to friend, th' insulting trojan came, 
and menac'd us with [[force]], our fleet with flame. 
was it the [[strength]] of this tongue-valiant [[lord]], 
in that black hour, that sav'd you from the [[sword]]? 
or was my breast expos'd alone, to brave 
a thousand swords [[sword]], a thousand ships to save? 
the hopes [[hope]] of your return! and can you yield, 
for a sav'd fleet, less than a [[single]] shield? 
think it no boast, o grecians, if i deem 
these arms want ajax, more than ajax them: 
or, i with them an [[equal]] [[honour]] share; 
they honour'd to be worn, and i to wear. 
will he compare my [[courage]] with his sleight? 
as well he may compare the day with night. 
night is indeed the province of his reign: 
yet all his dark exploits no more contain 
than a spy taken, and a sleeper slain; 
a [[priest]] made pris'ner, pallas made a prey: 
but none of all these actions done by day: 
nor ought of these was done, and diomede away. 
if on such petty merits [[merit]] you confer 
so vast a prize, let each his portion share; 
make a just dividend; and if not all, 
the greater part to diomede will fall. 
but why for ithacus such arms as those, 
who naked, and by night invades his foes? 
the glitt'ring helm by moonlight will proclaim 
the latent robber, and prevent his game: 
nor cou'd he hold his tott'ring head upright 
beneath that morion, or sustain the weight; 
nor that [[right]] arm cou'd toss the beamy lance; 
much less the left that ampler shield advance; 
pond'rous with precious weight, and rough with cost 
of the round [[world]] in rising gold emboss'd. 
that orb would ill become his hand to wield, 
and look as for the gold he stole the shield; 
which, shou'd your error on the wretch bestow, 
it would not frighten, but allure the foe: 
why asks he, what avails him not in [[fight]], 
and wou'd but cumber, and retard his flight, 
in which his only excellence is plac'd? 
you give him [[death]], that intercept his haste. 
add, that his own is yet a maiden-shield, 
nor the least dint has suffer'd in the field, 
guiltless of [[fight]]: mine batter'd, hew'd, and bor'd, 
worn out of service, must forsake his [[lord]], 
what farther need of words our [[right]] to scan? 
my arguments are deeds, let action speak the [[man]]. 
since from a champion's arms the strife arose, 
go cast the glorious prize amid the foes; 
then send us to redeem both arms, and shield, 
and let him wear, who wins 'em in the field. 

he said: a murmur from a multitude, 
or somewhat like a stifled shout, ensu'd: 
'till from his seat arose laertes' [[son]], 
look'd down a while, and paus'd, e'er he begun; 
then, to th' expecting audience, rais'd his look, 
and not without prepar'd attention spoke: 
soft was his tone, and sober was his face; 
action his words, and words his action grace. 

if heav'n, my lords [[lord]], had heard our [[common]] pray'r, 
these arms had caus'd no quarrel for an heir; 
still [[great]] achilles had his own possess'd, 
and we with [[great]] achilles had been bless'd; 
but since hard [[fate]], and heav'n's severe decree, 
have ravish'd him away from you, and me 
(at this he sigh'd, and wip'd his [[eyes]], and drew, 
or seem'd to draw, some drops of kindly dew), 
who [[better]] can succeed achilles lost, 
than he, who gave achilles to your hoast? 
this only i request, that neither he 
may gain, by being what he seems to be, 
a stupid thing; nor i may lose the prize, 
by having sense, which heav'n to him denies: 
since [[great]] or small, the talent i enjoy'd 
was ever in the [[common]] cause employ'd; 
nor let my wit, and wonted eloquence, 
which often has been us'd in your defense, 
and in my own, this only [[time]] be brought 
to bear against my [[self]], and deem'd a [[fault]]. 
make not a crime, where [[nature]] made it none; 
for ev'ry [[man]] may freely use his own. 
the deeds of long-descended [[ancestors]] 
are but by grace of imputation ours, 
theirs in effect; but since he draws his line 
from jove, and seems to plead a [[right]] [[divine]]; 
from jove, like him, i claim my pedigree, 
and am descended in the same [[degree]]: 
my sire laertes was arcesius' heir, 
arcesius was the [[son]] of [[jupiter]]: 
no parricide, no banish'd [[man]], is known 
in all my line: let him excuse his own. 
hermes ennobles too my mother's side, 
by both my parents to the gods ally'd. 
but not because that on the female part 
my [[blood]] is [[better]], dare i claim desert, 
or that my sire from parricide is [[free]]; 
but [[judge]] by [[merit]] betwixt him, and me: 
the prize be to the [[best]]; provided yet 
that ajax for a while his kin forget, 
and his [[great]] sire, and greater uncle's name, 
to fortifie by them his feeble claim: 
be kindred and relation laid aside, 
and honour's cause by laws [[law]] of [[honour]] try'd: 
for if he plead proximity of [[blood]]; 
that empty title is with ease withstood. 
peleus, the hero's sire, more nigh than he, 
and pyrrhus, his undoubted progeny, 
inherit first these trophies of the field; 
to scyros, or to pthia, send the shield: 
and teucer has an uncle's [[right]]; yet he 
waves his pretensions, nor contends with me. 

then since the cause on pure desert is plac'd, 
whence shall i take my rise, what reckon [[last]]? 
i not presume on ev'ry act to dwell, 
but take these few, in order as they fell. 

thetis, who knew the fates [[fate]], apply'd her [[care]] 
to keep achilles in [[disguise]] from [[war]]; 
and 'till the threatning influence was [[past]], 
a woman's habit on the hero cast: 
all [[eyes]] were cozen'd by the borrow'd vest, 
and ajax (never wiser than the rest) 
found no pelides there: at length i came 
with proffer'd wares to this pretended dame; 
she, not discover'd by her mien, or voice, 
betray'd her manhood by her manly [[choice]]; 
and while on female toys her fellows look, 
grasp'd in her warlike hand, a javelin shook; 
whom, by this act reveal'd, i thus bespoke: 
o goddess-born! resist not heav'n's decree, 
the fall of ilium is reserv'd for thee; 
then seiz'd him, and produc'd in open [[light]], 
sent blushing to the field the fatal knight. 
mine then are all his actions of the [[war]]; 
great telephus was conquer'd by my spear, 
and after cur'd: to me the thebans owe, 
lesbos, and tenedos, their overthrow; 
syros and cylla: not on all to dwell, 
by me lyrnesus, and [[strong]] chrysa fell: 
and since i sent the [[man]] who [[hector]] slew, 
to me the [[noble]] hector's [[death]] is due: 
those arms i put into his living hand, 
those arms, pelides [[dead]], i now demand. 

when greece was injur'd in the spartan [[prince]], 
and met at aulis to avenge th' offence, 
'twas a [[dead]] calm, or adverse blasts, that reign'd, 
and in the port the wind-bound fleet detain'd: 
bad signs were seen, and oracles severe 
were daily thunder'd in our gen'ral's ear; 
that by his daughter's [[blood]] we must appease 
diana's kindled wrath, and [[free]] the seas. 
affection, int'rest, fame, his [[heart]] assail'd: 
but soon the [[father]] o'er the [[king]] prevail'd: 
bold, on himself he took the pious crime, 
as angry with the gods, as they with him. 
no [[subject]] cou'd sustain their sov'reign's look, 
'till this hard enterprize i undertook: 
i only durst th' imperial pow'r controul, 
and undermin'd the parent in his [[soul]]; 
forc'd him t' exert the [[king]] for [[common]] [[good]], 
and [[pay]] our ransom with his daughter's [[blood]]. 
never was cause more difficult to plead, 
than where the [[judge]] against himself decreed: 
yet this i won by dint of argument; 
the wrongs [[wrong]] his injur'd [[brother]] underwent, 
and his own office, sham'd him to [[consent]]. 

'tis harder yet to move the mother's [[mind]], 
and to this heavy task was i design'd: 
reasons against her [[love]] i knew were [[vain]]; 
i circumvented whom i could not gain: 
had ajax been employ'd, our slacken'd sails 
had still at aulis waited [[happy]] gales. 

arriv'd at troy, your [[choice]] was fix'd on me, 
a fearless envoy, fit for a bold embassy: 
secure, i enter'd through the hostile court, 
glitt'ring with steel, and crowded with resort: 
there, in the midst of arms, i plead our cause, 
urge the foul rape, and violated laws [[law]]; 
accuse the foes, as authors of the strife, 
reproach the ravisher, demand the [[wife]]. 
priam, antenor, and the wiser few, 
i mov'd; but [[paris]], and his lawless crew 
scarce held their hands, and lifted swords [[sword]]; but stood 
in act to quench their impious thirst of [[blood]]: 
this menelaus knows [[know]]; expos'd to share 
with me the rough preludium of the [[war]]. 

endless it were to tell, what i have done, 
in arms, or council, since the siege begun: 
the first encounter's [[past]], the foe repell'd, 
they skulk'd within the town, we kept the field. 
war seem'd asleep for nine long years; at length 
both sides resolv'd to push, we try'd our [[strength]] 
now what did ajax, while our arms took breath, 
vers'd only in the gross mechanick [[trade]] of [[death]]? 
if you require my deeds, with ambush'd arms 
i trapp'd the foe, or tir'd with false alarms; 
secur'd the ships, drew lines along the plain, 
the fainting chear'd, chastis'd the rebel-train, 
provided forage, our spent arms renew'd; 
employ'd at [[home]], or sent abroad, the [[common]] cause pursu'd.

the [[king]], deluded in a [[dream]] by jove, 
despair'd to take the town, and order'd to remove. 
what [[subject]] durst arraign the pow'r supream, 
producing jove to justifie his [[dream]]? 
ajax might [[wish]] the soldiers to retain 
from shameful flight, but wishes [[wish]] were in [[vain]]: 
as wanting of effect had been his words, 
such as of course his thundring tongue affords. 
but did this boaster threaten, did he [[pray]], 
or by his own [[example]] urge their stay? 
none, none of these: but ran himself away. 
i saw him run, and was asham'd to see; 
who ply'd his feet so fast to get aboard, as he? 
then speeding through the place, i made a stand, 
and loudly cry'd, o base degenerate band, 
to leave a town already in your hand! 
after so long expence of [[blood]], for fame, 
to bring [[home]] nothing, but perpetual shame! 
these words, or what i have forgotten since 
(for [[grief]] inspir'd me then with eloquence), 
reduc'd their minds [[mind]]; they leave the crowded port, 
and to their late forsaken camp resort: 
dismay'd the council met: this [[man]] was there, 
but mute, and not recover'd of his [[fear]]: 
thersites tax'd the [[king]], and loudly rail'd, 
but his wide opening mouth with blows i seal'd. 
then, rising, i excite their souls [[soul]] to fame, 
and kindle sleeping [[virtue]] into flame. 
from thence, whatever he perform'd in [[fight]] 
is justly mine, who drew him back from flight. 

which of the grecian chiefs [[chief]] consorts with thee? 
but diomede desires [[desire]] my company, 
and still communicates his [[praise]] with me. 
as guided by a [[god]], secure he goes, 
arm'd with my fellowship, amid the foes: 
and sure no little [[merit]] i may boast, 
whom such a [[man]] selects from such an hoast; 
unforc'd by lots i went without affright, 
to dare with him the dangers of the night: 
on the same errand sent, we met the spy 
of [[hector]], double-tongu'd, and us'd to [[lie]]; 
him i dispatch'd, but not 'till undermin'd, 
i drew him first to tell, what treach'rous troy design'd:

my task perform'd, with [[praise]] i had retir'd, 
but not content with this, to greater [[praise]] aspir'd: 
invaded rhesus, and his thracian crew, 
and him, and his, in their own [[strength]] i slew; 
return'd a victor, all my vows compleat, 
with the king's chariot, in his [[royal]] seat: 
refuse me now his arms, whose fiery steeds 
were promis'd to the spy for his nocturnal deeds: 
yet let dull ajax bear away my [[right]], 
when all his days out-balance this one night. 

nor fought i darkling still: the sun beheld 
with slaughter'd lycians when i strew'd the field: 
you saw, and counted as i pass'd along, 
alastor, chromius, ceranos the [[strong]], 
alcander, prytanis, and halius, 
noemon, charopes, and ennomus; 
coon, chersidamas; and five beside, 
men of obscure descent, but [[courage]] try'd: 
all these this hand laid breathless on the ground; 
nor want i proofs of many a manly wound: 
all honest, all before: [[believe]] not me; 
words may [[deceive]], but credit what you see. 

at this he bar'd his breast, and show'd his scars, 
as of a furrow'd field, well plow'd with wars [[war]]; 
nor is this part unexercis'd, said he; 
that gyant-bulk of his from wounds is [[free]]: 
safe in his shield he fears [[fear]] no foe to try, 
and [[better]] manages his [[blood]], than i: 
but this avails me not; our boaster strove 
not with our foes alone, but partial jove, 
to save the fleet: this i confess is true 
(nor will i take from any [[man]] his due): 
but thus assuming all, he robs from you. 
some part of [[honour]] to your share will fall, 
he did the [[best]] indeed, but did not all. 
patroclus in achilles' arms, and [[thought]] 
the [[chief]] he seem'd, with [[equal]] ardour fought; 
preserv'd the fleet, repell'd the raging [[fire]], 
and forc'd the fearful trojans to retire. 

but ajax boasts, that he was only [[thought]] 
a match for [[hector]], who the combat sought: 
sure he forgets the [[king]], the chiefs [[chief]], and me: 
all were as eager for the [[fight]], as he: 
he but the ninth, and not by publick voice, 
or ours preferr'd, was only fortune's [[choice]]: 
they fought; nor can our hero boast th' event, 
for [[hector]] from the field unwounded went. 

why am i forc'd to name that fatal day, 
that snatch'd the prop and [[pride]] of greece away? 
i saw pelides sink, with pious [[grief]], 
and ran in [[vain]], alas! to his relief; 
for the brave [[soul]] was fled: full of my friend 
i rush'd amid the [[war]], his relicks to defend: 
nor ceas'd my toil, 'till i redeem'd the prey, 
and, loaded with achilles, march'd away: 
those arms, which on these shoulders then i bore, 
'tis just you to these shoulders should restore. 
you see i want not nerves, who cou'd sustain 
the pond'rous ruins of so [[great]] a [[man]]: 
or if in others [[equal]] [[force]] you find, 
none is endu'd with a more grateful [[mind]]. 

did thetis then, ambitious in her [[care]], 
these arms thus labour'd for her [[son]] prepare; 
that ajax after him the heav'nly gift shou'd wear! 
for that dull [[soul]] to stare with stupid [[eyes]], 
on the learn'd unintelligible prize! 
what are to him the sculptures of the shield, 
heav'n's planets, [[earth]], and ocean's watry field? 
the pleiads, hyads; less, and greater bear, 
undipp'd in seas; orion's angry star; 
two diff'ring cities [[city]], grav'd on either hand; 
would he wear arms he cannot [[understand]]? 

beside, what [[wise]] objections he prepares 
against my late accession to the wars [[war]]? 
does not the [[fool]] perceive his argument 
is with more [[force]] against achilles bent? 
for if dissembling be so [[great]] a crime, 
the [[fault]] is [[common]], and the same in him: 
and if he taxes both of long delay, 
my guilt is less, who sooner came away. 
his pious [[mother]], anxious for his [[life]], 
detain'd her [[son]]; and me, my pious [[wife]]. 
to them the blossoms of our [[youth]] were due, 
our riper manhood we reserv'd for you. 
but grant me guilty, 'tis not much my [[care]], 
when with so [[great]] a [[man]] my guilt i share: 
my wit to [[war]] the matchless hero brought, 
but by this [[fool]] i never had been caught. 

nor need i wonder, that on me he threw 
such foul aspersions, when he spares not you: 
if palamede unjustly fell by me, 
your [[honour]] suffer'd in th' [[unjust]] decree: 
i but accus'd, you doom'd: and yet he dy'd, 
convinc'd of [[treason]], and was fairly try'd: 
you heard not he was false; your [[eyes]] beheld 
the traytor manifest; the bribe reveal'd. 

that philoctetes is on lemnos left, 
wounded, forlorn, of [[human]] aid bereft, 
is not my crime, or not my crime alone; 
defend your [[justice]], for the fact's your own: 
'tis true, th' [[advice]] was mine; that staying there 
he might his weary limbs with rest repair, 
from a long [[voyage]] [[free]], and from a longer [[war]]. 
he took the counsl, and he lives [[life]] at least; 
th' event declares i counsell'd for the [[best]]: 
though [[faith]] is all in ministers of [[state]]; 
for who can promise to be fortunate? 
now since his arrows are the [[fate]] of troy, 
do not my wit, or [[weak]] address, employ; 
send ajax there, with his persuasive sense, 
to mollifie the [[man]], and draw him thence: 
but xanthus shall run backward; ida stand 
a leafless mountain; and the grecian band 
shall [[fight]] for troy; if, when my councils fail, 
the wit of heavy ajax can prevail. 

hard philoctetes, exercise thy spleen 
against thy fellows, and the [[king]] of [[men]]; 
curse my devoted head, above the rest, 
and [[wish]] in arms to meet me breast to breast: 
yet i the dang'rous task will undertake, 
and either [[die]] my [[self]], or bring thee back. 

nor [[doubt]] the same [[success]], as when before 
the phrygian [[prophet]] to these tents i bore, 
surpriz'd by night, and forc'd him to declare 
in what was plac'd the [[fortune]] of the [[war]], 
heav'n's dark decrees, and answers [[answer]] to display, 
and how to take the town, and where the secret lay: 
yet this i compass'd, and from troy convey'd 
the fatal image of their guardian-maid; 
that [[work]] was mine; for pallas, though our friend, 
yet while she was in troy, did troy defend. 
now what has ajax done, or what design'd? 
a noisie nothing, and an empty wind. 
if he be what he promises in show, 
why was i sent, and why fear'd he to go? 
our boasting champion [[thought]] the task not [[light]] 
to pass the guards, commit himself to night; 
not only through a hostile town to pass, 
but scale, with steep ascent, the [[sacred]] place; 
with wand'ring steps to search the cittadel, 
and from the priests [[priest]] their patroness to steal: 
then through surrounding foes to [[force]] my way, 
and bear in triumph [[home]] the heavn'ly prey; 
which had i not, ajax in [[vain]] had held, 
before that monst'rous bulk, his sev'nfold shield. 
that night to conquer troy i might be said, 
when troy was liable to [[conquest]] made. 

why point'st thou to my partner of the [[war]]? 
tydides had indeed a worthy share 
in all my toil, and [[praise]]; but when thy might 
our ships protected, did'st thou singly [[fight]]? 
all join'd, and thou of many wert but one; 
i ask'd no friend, nor had, but him alone: 
who, had he not been well assur'd, that art [[arts]], 
and conduct were of [[war]] the [[better]] part, 
and more avail'd than [[strength]], my valiant friend 
had urg'd a [[better]] [[right]], than ajax can pretend: 
as [[good]] at least eurypilus may claim, 
and the more mod'rate ajax of the name: 
the cretan [[king]], and his brave charioteer, 
and menelaus bold with [[sword]], and spear: 
all these had been my rivals in the shield, 
and yet all these to my pretensions yield. 
thy boist'rous hands are then of use, when i 
with this directing head those hands apply. 
brawn without brain is thine: my prudent [[care]] 
foresees, provides, administers the [[war]]: 
thy province is to [[fight]]; but when shall be 
the [[time]] to [[fight]], the [[king]] consults with me: 
no dram of [[judgment]] with thy [[force]] is join'd: 
thy [[body]] is of [[profit]], and my [[mind]]. 
by how much more the ship her safety owes 
to him who steers, than him that only rows; 
by how much more the captain merits [[merit]] [[praise]], 
than he who fights, and fighting but obeys; 
by so much greater is my worth than thine, 
who canst but execute, what i design. 
what gain'st thou, brutal [[man]], if i confess 
thy [[strength]] superior, when thy wit is less? 
mind is the [[man]]: i claim my whole desert, 
from the mind's vigour, and th' [[immortal]] part. 

but you, o grecian chiefs [[chief]], [[reward]] my [[care]], 
be grateful to your watchman of the [[war]]: 
for all my labours [[labour]] in so long a space, 
sure i may plead a title to your grace: 
enter the town, i then unbarr'd the gates, 
when i remov'd their tutelary fates [[fate]]. 
by all our [[common]] hopes [[hope]], if hopes [[hope]] they be 
which i have now reduc'd to certainty; 
by falling troy, by yonder tott'ring tow'rs, 
and by their taken gods, which now are ours; 
or if there yet a farther task remains, 
to be perform'd by prudence, or by pains [[pain]]; 
if yet some desp'rate action rests behind, 
that asks high conduct, and a dauntless [[mind]]; 
if ought be wanting to the trojan doom, 
which none but i can manage, and o'ercome, 
award, those arms i ask, by your decree: 
or give to this, what you refuse to me. 

he ceas'd: and ceasing with [[respect]] he bow'd, 
and with his hand at once the fatal statue show'd. 
heav'n, air and ocean rung, with loud applause, 
and by the gen'ral vote he gain'd his cause. 
thus conduct won the prize, when [[courage]] fail'd, 
and eloquence o'er brutal [[force]] prevail'd. 

the [[death]] of ajax 

he who cou'd often, and alone, withstand 
the foe, the [[fire]], and jove's own partial hand, 
now cannot his unmaster'd [[grief]] sustain, 
but yields to rage, to madness, and disdain; 
then snatching out his fauchion, thou, said he, 
art mine; [[ulysses]] lays no claim to thee. 
o often try'd, and ever-trusty [[sword]], 
now do thy [[last]] [[kind]] office to thy [[lord]]: 
'tis ajax who requests thy aid, to show 
none but himself, himself cou'd overthrow: 
he said, and with so [[good]] a will to [[die]], 
did to his breast the fatal point apply, 
it found his [[heart]], a way 'till then unknown, 
where never weapon enter'd, but his own. 
no hands cou'd [[force]] it thence, so fix'd it stood, 
'till out it rush'd, expell'd by streams of spouting [[blood]].

the fruitful [[blood]] produc'd a flow'r, which grew 
on a green stem; and of a purple hue: 
like his, whom unaware [[apollo]] slew: 
inscrib'd in both, the letters are the same, 
but those express the [[grief]], and these the name. 

the story of polyxena and hecuba 

the victor with full sails for lemnos stood 
(once stain'd by matrons with their husbands' blood), 
thence [[great]] alcides' fatal shafts to bear, 
assign'd to philoctetes' secret [[care]]. 
these with their guardian to the greeks [[greek]] convey'd, 
their ten years' toil with wish'd [[success]] repaid. 
with troy old priam falls: his queen survives; 
'till all her woes compleat, transform'd she grieves 
in borrow'd sounds, nor with an [[human]] face, 
barking tremendous o'er the plains of thrace. 
still ilium's flames their pointed columns raise, 
and the red hellespont reflects the blaze. 
shed on jove's altar are the [[poor]] remains 
of [[blood]], which trickl'd from old priam's veins. 
cassandra lifts her hands to heav'n in [[vain]], 
drag'd by her [[sacred]] hair; the trembling train 
of matrons to their burning temples fly: 
there to their gods for [[kind]] protection cry; 
and to their statues cling 'till forc'd away, 
the victor greeks [[greek]] bear off th' invidious prey. 
from those high tow'rs astyanax is thrown, 
whence he was wont with [[pleasure]] to look down. 
when oft his [[mother]] with a fond delight 
pointed to view his father's rage in [[fight]], 
to [[win]] renown, and guard his country's [[right]]. 

the winds now call to sea; brisk northern gales 
sing in the shrowds, and court the spreading sails. 
farewel, dear troy, the captive matrons cry; 
yes, we must leave our long-lov'd native [[sky]]. 
then prostrate on the shore they kiss the sand, 
and quit the smoking ruines of the [[land]]. 
last hecuba on board, [[sad]] sight! appears; 
found weeping o'er her children's sepulchres: 
drag'd by [[ulysses]] from her slaughter'd sons [[son]], 
whilst yet she graspt their tombs, and kist their mouldring bones.

yet hector's ashes from his urn she bore, 
and in her bosom the [[sad]] relique wore: 
then scatter'd on his tomb her hoary hairs, 
a [[poor]] oblation mingled with her tears. 

oppos'd to ilium lye the thracian plains, 
where polymestor safe in plenty reigns. 
king priam to his [[care]] commits his [[son]], 
young polydore, the [[chance]] of [[war]] to shun. 
a [[wise]] precaution! had not gold, consign'd 
for the child's use, debauch'd the tyrant's [[mind]]. 
when sinking troy to its [[last]] period drew, 
with impious hands his [[royal]] charge he slew; 
then in the sea the lifeless coarse is thrown; 
as with the [[body]] he the guilt could drown. 

the greeks [[greek]] now riding on the thracian shore, 
'till kinder gales invite, their vessels moor. 
here the wide-op'ning [[earth]] to sudden view 
disclos'd achilles, [[great]] as when he drew 
the vital air, but fierce with proud disdain, 
as when he sought briseis to regain; 
when stern debate, and rash injurious strife 
unsheath'd his [[sword]], to reach atrides' [[life]]. 
and will ye go? he said. is then the name 
of the once [[great]] achilles lost to fame? 
yet stay, ungrateful greeks [[greek]]; nor let me sue 
in [[vain]] for honours [[honour]] to my manes due. 
for this just end, polyxena i doom 
with victim-rites to grace my slighted tomb. 

the phantom spoke; the ready greeks [[greek]] obey'd, 
and to the tomb [[led]] the devoted maid 
snatch'd from her [[mother]], who with pious [[care]] 
cherish'd this [[last]] relief of her despair. 
superior to her [[sex]], the fearless maid, 
approach'd the altar, and around survey'd 
the cruel rites, and consecrated knife, 
which pyrrhus pointed at her guiltless [[life]], 
then as with stern amaze intent he stood, 
"now strike," she said; "now spill my genr'ous [[blood]]; 
deep in my breast, or throat, your dagger sheath, 
whilst thus i stand prepar'd to meet my [[death]]. 
for [[life]] on terms of slav'ry i despise: 
yet sure no [[god]] approves this [[sacrifice]]. 
o cou'd i but conceal this dire event 
from my [[sad]] [[mother]], i should dye content. 
yet should she not with tears my [[death]] deplore, 
since her own wretched [[life]] demands them more. 
but let not the rude touch of [[man]] pollute 
a virgin-victim; 'tis a modest suit. 
it [[best]] will please, whoe'er demands my [[blood]], 
that i untainted reach the stygian flood. 
yet let one short, [[last]], dying prayer be heard; 
to priam's [[daughter]] [[pay]] this [[last]] regard; 
'tis priam's [[daughter]], not a captive, sues; 
do not the rites of sepulture refuse. 
to my afflicted [[mother]], i implore, 
free without ransom my [[dead]] corpse restore: 
nor barter me for gain, when i am cold; 
but be her tears the price, if i am sold: 
time was she could have ransom'd me with gold". 

thus as she pray'd, one [[common]] shower of tears 
burst forth, and stream'd from ev'ry eye but hers. 
ev'n the [[priest]] wept, and with a rude remorse 
plung'd in her [[heart]] the steel's resistless [[force]]. 
her slacken'd limbs sunk gently to the ground, 
dauntless her looks, unalter'd by the wound. 
and as she fell, she strove with decent [[pride]] 
to hide, what suits a virgin's [[care]] to hide. 
the trojan matrons the pale corpse receive, 
and the whole slaughter'd [[race]] of priam grieve, 
sad they recount the long disastrous tale; 
then with fresh tears, thee, [[royal]] maid, bewail; 
thy widow'd [[mother]] too, who flourish'd late 
the [[royal]] [[pride]] of asia's happier [[state]]: 
a captive lot now to [[ulysses]] born; 
whom yet the victor would reject with scorn, 
were she not hector's [[mother]]: hector's fame 
scarce can a master for his [[mother]] claim! 
with strict embrace the lifeless coarse she view'd; 
and her fresh [[grief]] that flood of tears renew'd, 
with which she lately mourn'd so many [[dead]]; 
tears for her [[country]], sons [[son]], and husband shed. 
with the thick gushing stream she bath'd the wound; 
kiss'd her pale lips; then weltring on the ground, 
with wonted rage her frantick bosom tore; 
sweeping her hair amidst the clotted gore; 
whilst her [[sad]] accents thus her loss deplore. 

"behold a mother's [[last]] dear pledge of woe! 
yes, 'tis the [[last]] i have to suffer now. 
thou, my polyxena, my ills must [[crown]]: 
already in thy [[fate]], i [[feel]] my own. 
'tis thus, lest haply of my numerous seed 
one should unslaughter'd fall, even thou must bleed: 
and yet i hop'd thy [[sex]] had been thy guard; 
but neither has thy tender [[sex]] been spar'd. 
the same achilles, by whose deadly hate 
thy brothers [[brother]] fell, urg'd thy untimely fate! 
the same achilles, whose destructive rage 
laid waste my realms, has robb'd my childless [[age]]. 
when paris' shafts with phoebus' [[certain]] aid 
at length had pierc'd this dreaded [[chief]], i said, 
secure of future ills, he can no more: 
but see, he still pursues me as before. 
with rage rekindled his [[dead]] ashes burn; 
and his yet murd'ring ghost my wretched house must mourn.

this tyrant's [[lust]] of slaughter i have fed 
with large supplies from my too-fruitful bed. 
troy's tow'rs lye waste; and the wide ruin ends 
the publick woe; but me fresh woe attends. 
troy still survives to me; to none but me; 
and from its ills i never must be [[free]]. 
i, who so late had [[power]], and [[wealth]], and ease, 
bless'd with my husband, and a large encrease, 
must now in [[poverty]] an [[exile]] mourn; 
ev'n from the tombs of my [[dead]] offspring torn: 
giv'n to penelope, who proud of spoil, 
allots me to the loom's ungrateful toil; 
points to her dames, and crys with scorning mien: 
see hector's [[mother]], and [[great]] priam's queen! 
and thou, my child, sole [[hope]] of all that's lost, 
thou now art [[arts]] slain, to sooth this hostile ghost. 
yes, my child falls an offering to my foe! 
then what am i, who still survive this woe? 
say, cruel gods! for what new scenes of [[death]] 
must a [[poor]] aged wretch prolong this hated breath? 
troy fal'n, to whom could priam [[happy]] seem? 
yet was he so; and [[happy]] must i deem 
his [[death]]; for o! my child, he saw not thine, 
when he his [[life]] did with his troy resign. 
yet sure due obsequies thy tomb might grace; 
and thou shalt sleep amidst thy kingly [[race]]. 
alas! my child, such [[fortune]] does not wait 
our suffering house in this abandon'd [[state]]. 
a [[foreign]] grave, and thy [[poor]] mother's tears 
are all the honours [[honour]] that attend thy herse. 
all now is lost!- yet no; one comfort more 
of [[life]] remains, my much-lov'd polydore. 
my youngest [[hope]]: here on this coast he lives [[life]], 
nurs'd by the guardian-king, he still survives. 
then let me hasten to the cleansing flood, 
and wash away these stains of guiltless [[blood]]." 

streit to the shore her feeble steps repair 
with limping pace, and torn dishevell'd hair 
silver'd with [[age]]. "give me an urn," she cry'd, 
"to bear back water from this swelling tide": 
when on the banks her [[son]] in ghastly hue 
transfix'd with thracian arrows strikes her view. 
the matrons shriek'd; her big-swoln [[grief]] surpast 
the pow'r of utterance; she stood aghast; 
she had nor [[speech]], nor tears to give relief; 
excess of woe suppress'd the rising [[grief]]. 
lifeless as stone, on [[earth]] she fix'd her [[eyes]]; 
and then look'd up to heav'n with wild surprise. 
now she contemplates o'er with [[sad]] delight 
her son's pale visage; then her aking sight 
dwells on his wounds: she varys thus by turns, 
wild as the mother-lion, when among 
the haunts of prey she seeks her ravish'd [[young]]: 
swift flies the ravisher; she marks his trace, 
and by the print directs her anxious chase. 
so hecuba with mingled [[grief]], and rage 
pursues the [[king]], regardless of her [[age]]. 
she greets the murd'rer with dissembled joy 
of secret treasure hoarded for her boy. 
the specious tale th' unwary [[king]] betray'd. 
fir'd with the hopes [[hope]] of prey: "give quick," he said 
with soft enticing [[speech]], "the promis'd store: 
whate'er you give, you give to polydore. 
your [[son]], by the [[immortal]] gods i swear, 
shall this with all your former bounty share." 
she stands attentive to his soothing lyes, 
and darts avenging horrour from her [[eyes]]. 
then full resentment fires [[fire]] her boyling [[blood]]: 
she springs upon him, 'midst the captive crowd 
(her thirst of vengeance want of [[strength]] supplies): 
fastens her forky fingers in his [[eyes]]: 
tears out the rooted balls; her rage pursues, 
and in the hollow orbs her hand imbrews. 

the thracians, fir'd, at this inhuman scene, 
with darts, and stones assail the frantick queen. 
she snarls, and growls, nor in an [[human]] tone; 
then bites impatient at the bounding stone; 
extends her jaws, as she her voice would raise 
to keen invectives in her wonted phrase; 
but barks, and thence the yelping brute betrays. 
still a [[sad]] monument the place remains, 
and from this monstrous [[change]] its name obtains: 
where she, in long remembrance of her ills, 
with plaintive howlings the wide desart fills. 

greeks, trojans, [[friends]], and foes, and gods above 
her num'rous wrongs [[wrong]] to just compassion move. 
ev'n juno's [[self]] forgets her ancient hate, 
and owns, she had deserv'd a milder [[fate]]. 

the [[funeral]] of memnon 

yet bright aurora, partial as she was 
to troy, and those that lov'd the trojan cause, 
nor troy, nor hecuba can now bemoan, 
but weeps a [[sad]] misfortune, more her own. 
her offspring memnon, by achilles slain, 
she saw extended on the phrygian plain: 
she saw, and strait the purple beams, that grace 
the rosie morning, vanish'd from her face; 
a deadly pale her wonted bloom invades, 
and veils the lowring skies [[sky]] with mournful shades. 
but when his limbs upon the pile were laid, 
the [[last]] [[kind]] [[duty]] that by [[friends]] is paid, 
his [[mother]] to the skies [[sky]] directs her flight, 
nor cou'd sustain to view the doleful sight: 
but frantick, with her loose neglected hair, 
hastens to jove, and falls a suppliant there. 
o [[king]] of heav'n, o [[father]] of the skies [[sky]], 
the weeping [[goddess]] passionately cries, 
tho' i the meanest of immortals [[immortal]] am, 
and fewest temples celebrate my fame, 
yet still a [[goddess]], i presume to come 
within the verge of your etherial dome: 
yet still may plead some [[merit]], if my [[light]] 
with purple dawn controuls the pow'rs of night; 
if from a female hand that [[virtue]] springs, 
which to the gods, and [[men]] such [[pleasure]] brings. 
yet i nor honours [[honour]] seek, nor rites [[divine]], 
nor for more altars, or more fanes repine; 
oh! that such trifles were the only cause, 
from whence aurora's [[mind]] its anguish draws! 
for memnon lost, my dearest only child, 
with weightier [[grief]] my heavy [[heart]] is fill'd; 
my warrior son! that liv'd but half his [[time]], 
nipt in the bud, and blasted in his prime; 
who for his uncle early took the field, 
and by achilles' fatal spear was kill'd. 
to whom but jove shou'd i for succour come? 
for jove alone cou'd fix his cruel doom. 
o sov'reign of the gods accept my pray'r, 
grant my request, and sooth a mother's [[care]]; 
on the deceas'd some solemn boon bestow, 
to expiate the loss, and ease my woe. 

jove, with a nod, comply'd with her [[desire]]; 
around the [[body]] flam'd the fun'ral [[fire]]; 
the pile decreas'd, that lately seem'd so high, 
and sheets of smoak roll'd upward to the [[sky]]: 
as humid vapours from a marshy bog, 
rise by degrees [[degree]], condensing into fog, 
that intercept the sun's enliv'ning ray, 
and with a cloud infect the chearful day. 
the sooty ashes wafted by the air, 
whirl round, and thicken in a [[body]] there; 
then take a form, which their own heat, and [[fire]] 
with active [[life]], and energy inspire. 
its lightness makes it seem to fly, and soon 
it skims on real wings, that are its own; 
a real bird, it beats the breezy wind, 
mix'd with a thousand sisters of the [[kind]], 
that, from the same formation newly sprung, 
up-born aloft on plumy pinions hung. 
thrice round the pile advanc'd the circling throng. 
thrice, with their wings, a whizzing consort rung. 
in the fourth flight their squadron they divide, 
rank'd in two diff'rent [[troops]], on either side: 
then two, and two, inspir'd with martial rage, 
from either troop in [[equal]] pairs engage. 
each combatant with beak, and pounces press'd, 
in wrathful ire, his adversary's breast; 
each falls a victim, to preserve the fame 
of that [[great]] hero, whence their being came. 
from him their [[courage]], and their name they take, 
and, as they liv'd, they dye for memnon's sake. 
punctual to [[time]], with each revolving year, 
in fresh array the champion birds appear; 
again, prepar'd with vengeful minds [[mind]], they come 
to bleed, in [[honour]] of the souldier's tomb. 

therefore in others it appear'd not [[strange]], 
to grieve for hecuba's unhappy [[change]]: 
but [[poor]] aurora had enough to do 
with her own loss, to [[mind]] another's woe; 
who still in tears, her tender [[nature]] shews, 
besprinkling all the [[world]] with pearly dews. 

the [[voyage]] of [[aeneas]] 

troy thus destroy'd, 'twas still deny'd by [[fate]], 
the hopes [[hope]] of troy should perish with the [[state]]. 
his sire, the [[son]] of cytherea bore, 
and household-gods from burning ilium's shore, 
the pious [[prince]] (a double [[duty]] paid) 
each [[sacred]] burthen thro' the flames convey'd. 
with [[young]] ascanius, and this only prize, 
of heaps of [[wealth]], he from antandros flies; 
but struck with [[horror]], left the thracian shore, 
stain'd with the [[blood]] of murder'd polydore. 
the delian isle receives the banish'd train, 
driv'n by [[kind]] gales, and favour'd by the main. 

here pious anius, [[priest]], and monarch reign'd, 
and either charge, with [[equal]] [[care]] sustain'd, 
his subjects [[subject]] rul'd, to phoebus homage pay'd, 
his [[god]] obeying, and by those obey'd. 

the [[priest]] displays his hospitable gate, 
and shows the riches [[rich]] of his [[church]], and [[state]] 
the [[sacred]] shrubs, which eas'd latona's [[pain]], 
the palm, and olive, and the votive fane. 
here grateful flames with fuming incense fed, 
and mingled wine, ambrosial odours shed; 
of slaughter'd steers the crackling entrails burn'd: 
and then the strangers to the court return'd. 

on beds of tap'stry plac'd aloft, they dine 
with ceres' gift, and flowing bowls of wine; 
when thus anchises spoke, amidst the feast: 
say, mitred monarch, phoebus' chosen [[priest]], 
or (e'er from troy by cruel [[fate]] expell'd) 
when first mine [[eyes]] these [[sacred]] walls beheld, 
a [[son]], and twice two daughters [[daughter]] crown'd thy bliss? 
or errs my mem'ry, and i [[judge]] amiss? 

the [[royal]] [[prophet]] shook his hoary head, 
with snowy fillets bound, and sighing, said: 
thy mem'ry errs not, [[prince]]; thou saw'st me then, 
the [[happy]] [[father]] of so large a train; 
behold me now (such turns of [[chance]] befall 
the [[race]] of man!), almost bereft of all. 
for (ah!) what comfort can my [[son]] bestow, 
what [[help]] afford, to mitigate my woe! 
while far from hence, in andros' isle he reigns, 
(from him so nam'd) and there my place sustains. 
him delius praescience gave; the twice-born [[god]] 
a boon more wond'rous on the maids bestow'd. 
whate'er they touch'd, he gave them to transmute 
(a gift [[past]] credit, and above their suit) 
to ceres, bacchus, and minerva's fruit. 
how [[great]] their value, and how [[rich]] their use, 
whose only touch such treasures could produce! 

the dire destroyer of the trojan reign, 
fierce [[agamemnon]], such a prize to gain 
(a proof we also were design'd by [[fate]] 
to [[feel]] the tempest, that o'erturn'd your state), 
with [[force]] superior, and a ruffian crew, 
from these [[weak]] arms, the helpless virgins drew: 
and sternly [[bad]] them use the grant [[divine]], 
to keep the fleet in corn, and [[oil]], and wine. 
each, as they could, escap'd: two strove to gain 
euboea's isle, and two their brother's reign. 
the soldier follows, and demands the dames; 
if held by [[force]], immediate [[war]] proclaims. 
fear conquer'd [[nature]] in their brother's [[mind]], 
and gave them up to [[punishment]] assign'd. 
forgive the deed; nor hector's arm was there, 
nor thine, [[aeneas]], to maintain the [[war]]; 
whose only [[force]] upheld your ilium's tow'rs, 
for ten long years, against the grecian pow'rs. 
prepar'd to bind their captive arms in bands, 
to heav'n they rear'd their yet unfetter'd hands, 
help, bacchus, author of the gift, they pray'd; 
the gift's [[great]] author gave immediate aid; 
if such destruction of their [[human]] frame 
by ways so wond'rous, may deserve the name; 
nor could i hear, nor can i now relate 
exact, the manner of their alter'd [[state]]; 
but this in gen'ral of my loss i knew, 
transform'd to doves, on milky plumes they flew, 
such as on ida's mount thy consort's chariot drew. 

with such discourse, they entertain'd the feast; 
then rose from table, and withdrew to rest. 
the following morn, ere sol was seen to shine, 
th' inquiring trojans sought the [[sacred]] shrine; 
the mystick pow'r commands them to explore 
their ancient [[mother]], and a kindred shore. 
attending to the sea, the gen'rous [[prince]] 
dismiss'd his guests with [[rich]] munificence, 
in old anchises' hand a sceptre plac'd, 
a vest, and quiver [[young]] ascanius grac'd, 
his sire, a cup; which from th' aonian coast, 
ismenian therses sent his [[royal]] host. 
alcon of myle made what therses sent, 
and carv'd thereon this ample argument. 

a town with sev'n distinguish'd gates was shown, 
which spoke its name, and made the [[city]] known; 
before it, piles, and tombs, and rising flames, 
the rites of [[death]], and quires of mourning dames, 
who bar'd their breasts, and gave their hair to flow, 
the signs of [[grief]], and marks of publick woe. 
their fountains dry'd, the weeping naiads mourn'd, 
the trees stood bare, with searing cankers burn'd, 
no herbage cloath'd the ground, a ragged flock 
of goats half-famish'd, lick'd the naked rock, 
of manly [[courage]], and with [[mind]] serene, 
orion's daughters [[daughter]] in the town were seen; 
one heav'd her chest to meet the lifted knife, 
one plung'd the poyniard thro' the seat of [[life]], 
their country's victims; mourns the rescu'd [[state]], 
the bodies [[body]] burns, and celebrates their [[fate]]. 
to save the failure of th' illustrious line, 
from the pale ashes rose, of form [[divine]], 
two gen'rous youths [[youth]]; these, fame coronae calls, 
who join the pomp, and mourn their mother's falls. 

these burnish'd figures form'd of antique mold, 
shone on the brass, with rising sculpture bold; 
a wreath of gilt acanthus round the brim was roll'd. 

nor less expence the trojan gifts express'd; 
a fuming censer for the [[royal]] [[priest]], 
a chalice, and a [[crown]] of princely cost, 
with ruddy gold, and sparkling gems emboss'd. 

now hoisting sail, to crete the trojans stood, 
themselves remembring sprung from teucer's [[blood]]; 
but heav'n forbids, and pestilential jove 
from noxious skies [[sky]], the wand'ring navy drove. 
her hundred cities [[city]] left, from crete they bore, 
and sought the destin'd [[land]], ausonia's shore; 
but toss'd by storms at either strophas lay, 
'till scar'd by harpies from the faithless bay. 
then passing onward with a prosp'rous wind, 
left sly ulysses' spacious realms behind; 
ambracia's [[state]], in former ages [[age]] known. 
the strife of gods, the [[judge]] transform'd to stone 
they saw; for actian phoebus since renown'd, 
who caesar's arms with naval [[conquest]] crown'd; 
next pass'd dodona, wont of old to boast 
her vocal forest; and chaonia's coast, 
where [[king]] molossus' sons [[son]] on wings aspir'd, 
and saw secure the harmless fewel fir'd. 

now to phaeacia's [[happy]] isle they came, 
for fertile orchards known to early fame; 
epirus [[past]], they next beheld with joy 
a second ilium, and fictitious troy; 
here trojan helenus the sceptre sway'd, 
who show'd their [[fate]] and mystick truths [[truth]] display'd. 
by him confirm'd sicilia's isle they reach'd, 
whose sides to sea three promontories stretch'd, 
pachynos to the stormy south is plac'd, 
on lilybaeum blows the gentle west, 
peloro's cliffs the northern bear survey, 
who rolls above, and dreads to touch the sea. 
by this they steer, and favour'd by the tide, 
secure by night in zancle's harbour ride. 

here cruel scylla guards the rocky shore, 
and there the waves of loud charybdis roar: 
this sucks, and vomits ships, and bodies [[body]] drown'd; 
and rav'nous dogs the womb of that surround, 
in face a virgin; and (if ought be true 
by bards recorded) once a virgin too. 

a train of youths [[youth]] in [[vain]] desir'd her bed; 
by sea-nymphs lov'd, to nymphs [[nymph]] of seas she fled; 
the maid to these, with female [[pride]], display'd 
their baffled courtship, and their [[love]] betray'd. 

when galatea thus bespoke the [[fair]] 
(but first she sigh'd), while scylla comb'd her hair: 
you, lovely maid, a gen'rous [[race]] pursues, 
whom safe you may (as now you do) refuse; 
to me, tho' pow'rful in a num'rous train 
of sisters, sprung from gods, who [[rule]] the main, 
my native seas could scarce a refuge prove, 
to shun the fury of the cyclops' [[love]], 

tears choak'd her utt'rance here; the pity'ng maid 
with marble fingers wip'd them off, and said: 

my dearest [[goddess]], let thy scylla [[know]], 
(for i am faithful) whence these sorrows [[sorrow]] flow. 

the maid's intreaties o'er the [[nymph]] prevail, 
who thus to scylla tells the mournful tale. 

the story of acis, polyphemus and galatea 

acis, the lovely [[youth]], whose loss i mourn, 
from faunus, and the [[nymph]] symethis born, 
was both his parents' [[pleasure]]; but, to me 
was all that [[love]] could make a lover be. 
the gods our minds [[mind]] in mutual bands did join: 
i was his only joy, and he was mine. 
now sixteen summers the sweet [[youth]] had seen; 
and doubtful down began to shade his chin: 
when polyphemus first disturb'd our joy; 
and lov'd me fiercely, as i lov'd the boy. 
ask not which passion in my [[soul]] was high'r, 
my [[last]] aversion, or my first [[desire]]: 
nor this the greater was, nor that the less; 
both were alike, for both were in excess. 
thee, [[venus]], thee both heav'n, and [[earth]] obey; 
immense thy pow'r, and boundless is thy sway. 
the cyclops, who defy'd th' aetherial [[throne]], 
and [[thought]] no thunder louder than his own, 
the terror of the woods, and wilder far 
than wolves in plains, or bears in forests are, 
th' inhuman host, who made his bloody feasts 
on mangl'd members of his butcher'd guests, 
yet [[felt]] the [[force]] of [[love]], and fierce [[desire]], 
and burnt for me, with unrelenting [[fire]]. 
forgot his caverns, and his woolly [[care]], 
assum'd the softness of a lover's air; 
and comb'd, with teeth of rakes, his rugged hair. 
now with a crooked scythe his beard he sleeks; 
and mows the stubborn stubble of his cheeks: 
now in the crystal stream he looks, to try 
his simagres, and rowls his glaring eye. 
his [[cruelty]], and thirst of [[blood]] are lost; 
and ships securely sail along the coast. 

the [[prophet]] telemus (arriv'd by [[chance]] 
where aetna's summets to the seas advance, 
who mark'd the tracts of every bird that flew, 
and sure presages from their flying drew) 
foretold the cyclops, that ulysses' hand 
in his broad eye shou'd thrust a flaming brand. 
the giant, with a scornful grin, reply'd, 
vain augur, thou hast falsely prophesy'd; 
already [[love]] his flaming brand has tost; 
looking on two [[fair]] [[eyes]], my sight i lost, 
thus, warn'd in [[vain]], with stalking pace he strode, 
and stamp'd the margin of the briny flood 
with heavy steps; and weary, sought agen 
the cool retirement of his gloomy den. 

a promontory, sharp'ning by degrees [[degree]], 
ends in a wedge, and overlooks the seas: 
on either side, below, the water flows; 
this airy walk the giant lover chose. 
here on the midst he sate; his flocks, unled, 
their shepherd follow'd, and securely fed. 
a pine so burly, and of length so vast, 
that sailing ships requir'd it for a mast, 
he wielded for a staff, his steps to guide: 
but laid it by, his whistle while he try'd. 
a hundred reeds of a prodigious [[growth]], 
scarce made a pipe, proportion'd to his mouth: 
which when he gave it wind, the rocks around, 
and watry plains, the dreadful hiss resound. 
i heard the ruffian-shepherd rudely blow, 
where, in a hollow cave, i sat below; 
on acis' bosom i my head reclin'd: 
and still preserve the poem in my [[mind]]. 

oh lovely galatea, whiter far 
than falling snows, and rising lillies are; 
more flowry than the meads, as chrystal bright: 
erect as alders, and of [[equal]] height: 
more wanton than a kid, more sleek thy skin, 
than orient shells, that on the shores are seen, 
than apples fairer, when the boughs they lade; 
pleasing, as winter suns, or summer shade: 
more grateful to the sight, than goodly plains; 
and softer to the touch, than down of swans; 
or curds new turn'd; and sweeter to the taste 
than swelling grapes, that to the vintage haste: 
more clear than ice, or running streams, that stray 
through garden plots, but ah! more swift than they. 

yet, galatea, harder to be broke 
than bullocks, unreclaim'd, to bear the yoke, 
and far more stubborn, than the knotted oak: 
like sliding streams, impossible to hold; 
like them, fallacious, like their fountains, cold. 
more warping, than the willow, to decline 
my warm embrace, more brittle, than the vine; 
immovable, and fixt in thy disdain: 
tough, as these rocks, and of a harder grain. 
more [[violent]], than is the rising flood; 
and the prais'd peacock is not half so proud. 
fierce, as the [[fire]], and sharp, as thistles are, 
and more outragious, than a mother-bear: 
deaf, as the billows to the vows i make; 
and more revengeful, than a trodden snake. 
in swiftness fleeter, than the flying hind, 
or driven tempests, or the driving wind. 
all other faults [[fault]], with patience i can bear; 
but swiftness is the [[vice]] i only [[fear]]. 

yet if you knew me well, you wou'd not shun 
my [[love]], but to my wish'd embraces run: 
wou'd languish in your turn, and court my stay; 
and much repent of your unwise delay. 

my palace, in the living rock, is made 
by nature's hand; a spacious pleasing shade: 
which neither heat can pierce, nor cold invade. 
my garden fill'd with fruits you may behold, 
and grapes in clusters, imitating gold; 
some blushing bunches of a purple hue: 
and these, and those, are all reserv'd for you. 
red strawberries, in shades, expecting stand, 
proud to be gather'd by so [[white]] a hand. 
autumnal cornels latter fruit provide; 
and plumbs, to tempt you, turn their glossy side: 
not those of [[common]] kinds [[kind]]; but such alone, 
as in phaeacian orchards might have grown: 
nor chestnuts shall be wanting to your food, 
nor garden-fruits, nor wildings of the wood; 
the laden boughs for you alone shall bear; 
and yours shall be the product of the year. 

the flocks you see, are all my own; beside 
the rest that woods, and winding vallies hide; 
and those that folded in the caves abide. 
ask not the numbers of my growing store; 
who knows [[know]] how many, knows [[know]] he has no more. 
nor will i [[praise]] my cattle; trust not me, 
but [[judge]] your [[self]], and pass your own decree: 
behold their swelling dugs; the sweepy weight 
of ewes, that sink beneath the milky freight; 
in the warm folds their tender lambkins lye; 
apart from kids, that call with [[human]] cry. 
new milk in nut-brown bowls is duely serv'd 
for daily drink; the rest for cheese reserv'd. 
nor are these household dainties all my store: 
the fields, and forests will afford us more; 
the deer, the hare, the goat, the savage boar. 
all sorts of ven'son; and of birds the [[best]]; 
a pair of turtles taken from the nest. 
i walk'd the mountains, and two cubs i found 
(whose dam had left 'em on the naked ground), 
so like, that no distinction could be seen: 
so pretty, they were presents [[present]] for a queen; 
and so they shall; i took them both away; 
and keep, to be companions of your play. 

oh raise, [[fair]] [[nymph]], your beauteous face above 
the waves; nor scorn my presents [[present]], and my [[love]]. 
come, galatea, come, and view my face; 
i late beheld it, in the watry glass; 
and found it lovelier, than i fear'd it was. 
survey my towring stature, and my size: 
not jove, the jove you [[dream]], that rules [[rule]] the skies [[sky]], 
bears such a bulk, or is so largely spread: 
my locks (the plenteous harvest of my head) 
hang o'er my manly face; and dangling down, 
as with a shady grove, my shoulders [[crown]]. 
nor [[think]], because my limbs and [[body]] bear 
a thick-set underwood of bristling hair, 
my shape deform'd; what fouler sight can be, 
than the bald branches of a leafless tree? 
foul is the steed without a flowing mane: 
and birds, without their feathers, and their train. 
wool decks the sheep; and [[man]] receives a grace 
from bushy limbs, and from a bearded face. 
my forehead with a [[single]] eye is fill'd, 
round, as a ball, and ample, as a shield. 
the glorious lamp of heav'n, the radiant sun, 
is nature's eye; and she's content with one. 
add, that my [[father]] sways your seas, and i, 
like you, am of the watry [[family]]. 
i make you his, in making you my own; 
you i adore; and kneel to you alone: 
jove, with his fabled thunder, i despise, 
and only [[fear]] the lightning of your [[eyes]]. 
frown not, [[fair]] [[nymph]]; yet i cou'd bear to be 
disdain'd, if others were disdain'd with me. 
but to repulse the cyclops, and prefer 
the [[love]] of acis (heav'ns!) i cannot bear. 
but let the stripling please himself; nay more, 
please you, tho' that's the thing i most abhor; 
the boy shall find, if e'er we cope in [[fight]], 
these giant limbs, endu'd with giant might. 
his living bowels from his belly torn, 
and scatter'd limbs shall on the flood be born: 
thy flood, ungrateful [[nymph]]; and [[fate]] shall find, 
that way for thee, and acis to be join'd. 
for oh! i burn with [[love]], and thy disdain 
augments at once my passion, and my [[pain]]. 
translated aetna flames within my [[heart]], 
and thou, inhuman, wilt not ease my smart. 

lamenting thus in [[vain]], he rose, and strode 
with furious paces to the neighb'ring wood: 
restless his feet, distracted was his walk; 
mad were his motions, and confus'd his talk. 
mad, as the vanquish'd bull, when forc'd to yield 
his lovely mistress, and forsake the field. 

thus far unseen i saw: when fatal [[chance]], 
his looks directing, with a sudden glance, 
acis and i were to his sight betray'd; 
where, nought suspecting, we securely play'd. 
from his wide mouth a bellowing cry he cast, 
i see, i see; but this shall be your [[last]]: 
a roar so loud made aetna to rebound: 
and all the cyclops labour'd in the sound. 
affrighted with his monstrous voice, i fled, 
and in the neighbouring ocean plung'd my head. 
poor acis turn'd his back, and [[help]], he cry'd, 
help, galatea, [[help]], my parent gods, 
and take me dying to your deep abodes. 
the cyclops follow'd; but he sent before 
a rib, which from the living rock he tore: 
though but an angle reach'd him of the stone, 
the mighty fragment was enough alone, 
to crush all acis; 'twas too late to save, 
but what the fates [[fate]] allow'd to give, i gave: 
that acis to his lineage should return; 
and rowl, among the river gods, his urn. 
straight issu'd from the stone a stream of [[blood]]; 
which lost the purple, mingling with the flood, 
then, like a troubled torrent, it appear'd: 
the torrent too, in little space, was clear'd. 
the stone was cleft, and through the yawning chink 
new reeds arose, on the new river's brink. 
the rock, from out its hollow womb, disclos'd 
a sound like water in its course oppos'd, 
when (wond'rous to behold), full in the flood, 
up starts a [[youth]], and navel high he stood. 
horns from his temples rise; and either horn 
thick wreaths of reeds (his native growth) adorn. 
were not his stature taller than before, 
his bulk augmented, and his [[beauty]] more, 
his colour blue; for acis he might pass: 
and acis chang'd into a stream he was, 
but mine no more; he rowls along the plains 
with rapid motion, and his name retains. 

the story of glaucus and scylla 

here ceas'd the [[nymph]]; the [[fair]] assembly broke, 
the sea-green nereids to the waves betook: 
while scylla, fearful of the wide-spread main, 
swift to the safer shore returns again. 
there o'er the sandy margin, unarray'd, 
with printless footsteps flies the bounding maid; 
or in some winding creek's secure retreat 
she baths her weary limbs, and shuns the noonday's heat.

her glaucus saw, as o'er the deep he rode, 
new to the seas, and late receiv'd a [[god]]. 
he saw, and languish'd for the virgin's [[love]]; 
with many an artful blandishment he strove 
her flight to hinder, and her fears [[fear]] remove. 
the more he sues, the more she wings her flight, 
and nimbly gains a neighb'ring mountain's height. 
steep shelving to the margin of the flood, 
a neighb'ring mountain bare, and woodless stood; 
here, by the place secur'd, her steps she stay'd, 
and, trembling still, her lover's form survey'd. 
his shape, his hue, her troubled sense appall, 
and dropping locks that o'er his shoulders fall; 
she sees his face [[divine]], and manly brow, 
end in a fish's wreathy tail below: 
she sees, and doubts [[doubt]] within her anxious [[mind]], 
whether he comes of [[god]], or monster [[kind]]. 
this glaucus soon perceiv'd; and, oh! forbear 
(his hand supporting on a rock lay near), 
forbear, he cry'd, fond maid, this needless [[fear]]. 
nor fish am i, nor monster of the main, 
but [[equal]] with the watry gods i reign; 
nor proteus, nor palaemon me excell, 
nor he whose breath inspires the sounding shell. 
my birth, 'tis true, i owe to mortal [[race]], 
and i my [[self]] but late a mortal was: 
ev'n then in seas, and seas alone, i joy'd; 
the seas my hours, and all my cares [[care]] employ'd, 
in meshes now the twinkling prey i drew; 
now skilfully the slender line i threw, 
and silent sat the moving float to view. 
not far from shore, there lies [[lie]] a verdant mead, 
with herbage half, and half with water spread: 
there, nor the horned heifers browsing stray, 
nor shaggy kids, nor wanton lambkins play; 
there, nor the sounding bees their nectar cull, 
nor rural swains their genial chaplets pull, 
nor flocks, nor herds, nor mowers haunt the place, 
to crop the flow'rs, or cut the bushy grass: 
thither, sure first of living [[race]] came i, 
and sat by [[chance]], my dropping nets to dry. 
my scaly prize, in order all display'd, 
by number on the greensward there i lay'd, 
my captives, whom or in my nets i took, 
or hung unwary on my wily hook. 
strange to behold! yet what avails a lye? 
i saw 'em bite the grass, as i sate by; 
then sudden darting o'er the verdant plain, 
they spread their finns, as in their native main: 
i paus'd, with wonder struck, while all my prey 
left their new master, and regain'd the sea. 
amaz'd, within my secret [[self]] i sought, 
what [[god]], what herb the miracle had wrought: 
but sure no herbs have pow'r like this, i cry'd; 
and strait i pluck'd some neighb'ring herbs, and try'd. 
scarce had i bit, and prov'd the wond'rous taste, 
when [[strong]] convulsions shook my troubled breast; 
i [[felt]] my [[heart]] grow fond of something [[strange]], 
and my whole [[nature]] lab'ring with a [[change]]. 
restless i grew, and ev'ry place forsook, 
and still upon the seas i bent my look. 
farewel for ever! farewel, land! i said; 
and plung'd amidst the waves my sinking head. 
the gentle pow'rs, who that low [[empire]] keep, 
receiv'd me as a [[brother]] of the deep; 
to tethys, and to ocean old, they [[pray]] 
to purge my mortal earthy parts away. 
the watry parents to their suit agreed, 
and thrice nine times [[time]] a secret charm they [[read]], 
then with lustrations purify my limbs, 
and bid me bathe beneath a hundred streams: 
a hundred streams from various fountains run, 
and on my head at once come rushing down. 
thus far each passage i [[remember]] well, 
and faithfully thus far the tale i tell; 
but then oblivion dark, on all my senses fell. 
again at length my [[thought]] reviving came, 
when i no longer found my [[self]] the same; 
then first this sea-green beard i [[felt]] to grow, 
and these large honours [[honour]] on my spreading brow; 
my long-descending locks the billows sweep, 
and my broad shoulders cleave the yielding deep; 
my fishy tail, my arms of azure hue, 
and ev'ry part divinely chang'd, i view. 
but what avail these useless honours [[honour]] now? 
what joys can immortality bestow? 
what, tho' our nereids all my form approve? 
what boots it, while [[fair]] scylla scorns my [[love]]? 

thus far the [[god]]; and more he wou'd have said; 
when from his presence flew the ruthless maid. 
stung with repulse, in such disdainful sort, 
he seeks titanian circe's horrid court.

book the fourteenth

the transformation of scylla 

now glaucus, with a lover's haste, bounds o'er 
the swelling waves, and seeks the latian shore. 
messena, rhegium, and the barren coast 
of flaming aetna, to his sight are lost: 
at length he gains the tyrrhene seas, and views 
the hills where baneful philters circe brews; 
monsters, in various forms, around her press; 
as thus the [[god]] salutes the sorceress. 
o circe, be indulgent to my [[grief]], 
and give a love-sick deity relief. 
too well the mighty pow'r of plants i [[know]], 
to those my figure, and new [[fate]] i owe. 
against messena, on th' ausonian coast, 
i scylla view'd, and from that hour was lost. 
in tend'rest sounds i su'd; but still the [[fair]] 
was deaf to vows, and pityless to pray'r. 
if numbers can avail, exert their pow'r; 
or energy of plants, if plants have more. 
i ask no cure; let but the virgin pine 
with dying pangs, or agonies, like mine. 

no longer circe could her flame [[disguise]], 
but to the suppliant [[god]] marine, replies: 

when maids are coy, have manlier aims in view; 
leave those that fly, but those that like, pursue. 
if [[love]] can be by [[kind]] compliance won; 
see, at your feet, the [[daughter]] of the sun. 

sooner, said glaucus, shall the ash remove 
from mountains, and the swelling surges [[love]]; 
or humble sea-weed to the hills repair; 
e'er i [[think]] any but my scylla [[fair]]. 

strait circe reddens with a guilty shame, 
and vows [[revenge]] for her rejected flame. 
fierce liking oft a spight as fierce creates; 
for [[love]] refus'd, without aversion, hates. 
to hurt her hapless rival she proceeds; 
and, by the fall of scylla, glaucus bleeds. 

some fascinating bev'rage now she brews; 
compos'd of deadly drugs, and baneful juice. 
at rhegium she arrives; the ocean braves, 
and treads with unwet feet the boiling waves. 
upon the beach a winding bay there lies [[lie]], 
shelter'd from seas, and shaded from the skies [[sky]]: 
this station scylla chose: a soft retreat 
from chilling winds, and raging cancer's heat. 
the vengeful sorc'ress visits this recess; 
her charm infuses, and infects the place. 
soon as the [[nymph]] wades in, her nether parts 
turn into dogs; then at her [[self]] she starts. 
a ghastly [[horror]] in her [[eyes]] appears; 
but yet she knows [[know]] not, who it is she fears [[fear]]; 
in [[vain]] she offers from her [[self]] to run, 
and drags about her what she strives to shun.
