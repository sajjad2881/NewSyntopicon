arms, and the [[man]] i sing, who, forc'd by [[fate]], 
and haughty juno's unrelenting hate, 
expell'd and exil'd, left the trojan shore. 
long labors, both by sea and [[land]], he bore, 
and in the doubtful [[war]], before he won 
the latian realm, and built the destin'd town; 
his banish'd gods restor'd to rites [[divine]], 
and settled sure succession in his line, 
from whence the [[race]] of alban fathers [[father]] come, 
and the long glories of majestic [[rome]]. 
o muse! the causes and the crimes relate; 
what [[goddess]] was provok'd, and whence her hate; 
for what offense the queen of heav'n began 
to [[persecute]] so brave, so just a [[man]]; 
involv'd his anxious [[life]] in endless cares [[care]], 
expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars! 
can heav'nly minds [[mind]] such high resentment show, 
or exercise their spite in [[human]] woe? 
against the tiber's mouth, but far away, 
an ancient town was seated on the sea; 
a tyrian colony; the [[people]] made 
stout for the [[war]], and studious of their [[trade]]: 
carthage the name; belov'd by juno more 
than her own argos, or the samian shore. 
here stood her chariot; here, if heav'n were [[kind]], 
the seat of awful [[empire]] she design'd. 
yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly, 
(long cited by the [[people]] of the [[sky]],) 
that times [[time]] to come should see the trojan [[race]] 
her [[carthage]] ruin, and her tow'rs deface; 
nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway 
should on the necks of all the nations lay. 
she ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in [[fate]]; 
nor could forget the [[war]] she wag'd of late 
for conqu'ring greece against the trojan [[state]]. 
besides, long causes working in her [[mind]], 
and secret seeds of envy, lay behind; 
deep graven in her [[heart]] the doom remain'd 
of partial [[paris]], and her form disdain'd; 
the grace bestow'd on ravish'd ganymed, 
electra's glories, and her injur'd bed. 
each was a cause alone; and all combin'd 
to kindle vengeance in her haughty [[mind]]. 
for this, far distant from the latian coast 
she drove the remnants of the trojan host; 
and sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train 
were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main. 
such [[time]], such toil, requir'd the roman name, 
such length of labor for so vast a frame. 
now scarce the trojan fleet, with sails and oars, 
had left behind the [[fair]] sicilian shores, 
ent'ring with cheerful shouts the wat'ry reign, 
and plowing frothy furrows in the main; 
when, lab'ring still with endless discontent, 
the queen of heav'n did thus her fury vent: 
"then am i vanquish'd? must i yield?" said she, 
"and must the trojans reign in [[italy]]? 
so [[fate]] will have it, and jove adds his [[force]]; 
nor can my pow'r divert their [[happy]] course. 
could angry pallas, with revengeful spleen, 
the grecian navy burn, and drown the [[men]]? 
she, for the [[fault]] of one offending foe, 
the bolts of jove himself presum'd to throw: 
with whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship, 
and bare expos'd the bosom of the deep; 
then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game, 
the wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame, 
she strongly seiz'd, and with a burning wound 
transfix'd, and naked, on a rock she bound. 
but i, who walk in awful [[state]] above, 
the majesty of heav'n, the sister [[wife]] of jove, 
for length of years my fruitless [[force]] employ 
against the thin remains of ruin'd troy! 
what nations now to juno's pow'r will [[pray]], 
or off'rings on my slighted altars lay?" 
thus rag'd the [[goddess]]; and, with fury fraught. 
the restless regions of the storms she sought, 
where, in a spacious cave of living stone, 
the [[tyrant]] aeolus, from his airy [[throne]], 
with pow'r imperial curbs the struggling winds, 
and sounding tempests in dark prisons binds. 
this way and that th' impatient captives tend, 
and, pressing for release, the mountains rend. 
high in his hall th' undaunted monarch stands, 
and shakes his scepter, and their rage commands; 
which did he not, their unresisted sway 
would sweep the [[world]] before them in their way; 
earth, air, and seas thro' empty space would roll, 
and heav'n would fly before the driving [[soul]]. 
in [[fear]] of this, the [[father]] of the gods 
confin'd their fury to those dark abodes, 
and lock'd 'em safe within, oppress'd with mountain loads;

impos'd a [[king]], with arbitrary sway, 
to loose their fetters, or their [[force]] allay. 
to whom the suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd, 
and thus the tenor of her suit express'd: 
"o aeolus! for to thee the [[king]] of heav'n 
the pow'r of tempests and of winds has giv'n; 
thy [[force]] alone their fury can restrain, 
and smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main- 
a [[race]] of wand'ring slaves [[slave]], abhorr'd by me, 
with prosp'rous passage cut the tuscan sea; 
to fruitful [[italy]] their course they steer, 
and for their vanquish'd gods design new temples there. 
raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies [[sky]]; 
sink or disperse my fatal enemies [[enemy]]. 
twice sev'n, the charming daughters [[daughter]] of the main, 
around my [[person]] wait, and bear my train: 
succeed my [[wish]], and second my design; 
the fairest, deiopeia, shall be thine, 
and make thee [[father]] of a [[happy]] line." 
to this the [[god]]: "'t is yours, o queen, to will 
the [[work]] which [[duty]] binds me to fulfil. 
these airy kingdoms [[kingdom]], and this wide command, 
are all the presents [[present]] of your bounteous hand: 
yours is my sov'reign's grace; and, as your guest, 
i sit with gods at their celestial feast; 
raise tempests at your [[pleasure]], or subdue; 
dispose of [[empire]], which i hold from you." 
he said, and hurl'd against the mountain side 
his quiv'ring spear, and all the [[god]] applied. 
the raging winds rush thro' the hollow wound, 
and dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground; 
then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep, 
raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep. 
south, east, and west with mix'd confusion roar, 
and roll the foaming billows to the shore. 
the cables crack; the sailors' fearful cries 
ascend; and sable night involves the skies [[sky]]; 
and heav'n itself is ravish'd from their [[eyes]]. 
loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue; 
then flashing fires [[fire]] the transient [[light]] renew; 
the face of things a frightful image bears, 
and [[present]] [[death]] in various forms appears. 
struck with unusual fright, the trojan [[chief]], 
with lifted hands and [[eyes]], invokes relief; 
and, "thrice and four times [[time]] [[happy]] those," he cried, 
"that under ilian walls before their parents died! 
tydides, bravest of the grecian train! 
why could not i by that [[strong]] arm be slain, 
and [[lie]] by [[noble]] [[hector]] on the plain, 
or [[great]] sarpedon, in those bloody fields 
where simois rolls the bodies [[body]] and the shields 
of heroes, whose dismember'd hands yet bear 
the dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!" 
thus while the pious [[prince]] his [[fate]] bewails, 
fierce boreas drove against his flying sails, 
and rent the sheets; the raging billows rise, 
and mount the tossing vessels to the skies [[sky]]: 
nor can the shiv'ring oars sustain the blow; 
the galley gives her side, and turns her prow; 
while those astern, descending down the steep, 
thro' gaping waves behold the boiling deep. 
three ships were hurried by the southern blast, 
and on the secret shelves with fury cast. 
those hidden rocks th' ausonian sailors knew: 
they call'd them altars, when they rose in view, 
and show'd their spacious backs above the flood. 
three more fierce eurus, in his angry mood, 
dash'd on the shallows of the moving sand, 
and in mid ocean left them moor'd aland. 
orontes' bark, that bore the lycian crew, 
(a horrid sight!) ev'n in the hero's view, 
from stem to stern by waves was overborne: 
the trembling pilot, from his rudder torn, 
was headlong hurl'd; thrice round the ship was toss'd, 
then bulg'd at once, and in the deep was lost; 
and here and there above the waves were seen 
arms, pictures, precious goods [[good]], and floating [[men]]. 
the stoutest vessel to the storm gave way, 
and suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea. 
ilioneus was her [[chief]]: alethes old, 
achates faithful, abas [[young]] and bold, 
endur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams, 
admit the deluge of the briny streams. 
meantime imperial [[neptune]] heard the sound 
of raging billows breaking on the ground. 
displeas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry reign, 
he rear'd his awful head above the main, 
serene in majesty; then roll'd his [[eyes]] 
around the space of [[earth]], and seas, and skies [[sky]]. 
he saw the trojan fleet dispers'd, distress'd, 
by stormy winds and wintry heav'n oppress'd. 
full well the [[god]] his sister's envy knew, 
and what her aims and what her [[arts]] pursue. 
he summon'd eurus and the western blast, 
and first an angry glance on both he cast; 
then thus rebuk'd: "audacious winds! from whence 
this bold attempt, this rebel insolence? 
is it for you to ravage seas and [[land]], 
unauthoriz'd by my supreme command? 
to raise such mountains on the troubled main? 
whom i- but first 't is fit the billows to restrain; 
and then you shall be taught [[obedience]] to my reign. 
hence! to your [[lord]] my [[royal]] mandate bear- 
the realms of ocean and the fields of air 
are mine, not his. by fatal lot to me 
the liquid [[empire]] fell, and trident of the sea. 
his pow'r to hollow caverns is confin'd: 
there let him reign, the jailer of the wind, 
with hoarse commands his breathing subjects [[subject]] call, 
and boast and bluster in his empty hall." 
he spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth'd the sea, 
dispell'd the darkness, and restor'd the day. 
cymothoe, triton, and the sea-green train 
of beauteous nymphs [[nymph]], the daughters [[daughter]] of the main, 
clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands: 
the [[god]] himself with ready trident stands, 
and opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands; 
then heaves them off the shoals. where'er he guides 
his finny coursers and in triumph rides, 
the waves unruffle and the sea subsides. 
as, when in tumults rise th' ignoble crowd, 
mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud; 
and stones and brands in rattling volleys fly, 
and all the rustic arms that fury can supply: 
if then some grave and pious [[man]] appear, 
they hush their noise, and lend a list'ning ear; 
he soothes with sober words their angry mood, 
and quenches their innate [[desire]] of [[blood]]: 
so, when the [[father]] of the flood appears, 
and o'er the seas his sov'reign trident rears, 
their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains, 
high on his chariot, and, with loosen'd reins, 
majestic moves along, and awful [[peace]] maintains. 
the weary trojans ply their shatter'd oars 
to nearest [[land]], and make the libyan shores. 
within a long recess there lies [[lie]] a bay: 
an island shades it from the rolling sea, 
and forms a port secure for ships to ride; 
broke by the jutting [[land]], on either side, 
in double streams the briny waters glide. 
betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene 
appears above, and groves for ever green: 
a grot is form'd beneath, with mossy seats, 
to rest the nereids, and exclude the heats. 
down thro' the crannies of the living walls 
the crystal streams descend in murm'ring falls: 
no haulsers need to bind the vessels here, 
nor bearded anchors; for no storms they [[fear]]. 
sev'n ships within this [[happy]] harbor meet, 
the thin remainders of the scatter'd fleet. 
the trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes, 
leap on the welcome [[land]], and seek their wish'd repose. 
first, [[good]] achates, with repeated strokes 
of clashing flints, their hidden [[fire]] provokes: 
short flame succeeds; a bed of wither'd leaves 
the dying sparkles in their fall receives: 
caught into [[life]], in fiery fumes they rise, 
and, fed with stronger food, invade the skies [[sky]]. 
the trojans, dropping wet, or stand around 
the cheerful blaze, or [[lie]] along the ground: 
some dry their corn, infected with the brine, 
then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine. 
aeneas climbs the mountain's airy brow, 
and takes a prospect of the seas below, 
if capys thence, or antheus he could spy, 
or see the streamers of caicus fly. 
no vessels were in view; but, on the plain, 
three beamy stags command a lordly train 
of branching heads: the more ignoble throng 
attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along. 
he stood; and, while secure they fed below, 
he took the quiver and the trusty bow 
achates us'd to bear: the leaders first 
he laid along, and then the vulgar pierc'd; 
nor ceas'd his arrows, till the shady plain 
sev'n mighty bodies [[body]] with their [[blood]] distain. 
for the sev'n ships he made an [[equal]] share, 
and to the port return'd, triumphant from the [[war]]. 
the jars of gen'rous wine (acestes' gift, 
when his trinacrian shores the navy left) 
he set abroach, and for the feast prepar'd, 
in [[equal]] portions with the ven'son shar'd. 
thus while he dealt it round, the pious [[chief]] 
with cheerful words allay'd the [[common]] [[grief]]: 
"endure, and conquer! jove will soon dispose 
to future [[good]] our [[past]] and [[present]] woes. 
with me, the rocks of scylla you have tried; 
th' inhuman cyclops and his den defied. 
what greater ills hereafter can you bear? 
resume your [[courage]] and dismiss your [[care]], 
an hour will come, with [[pleasure]] to relate 
your sorrows [[sorrow]] [[past]], as benefits of [[fate]]. 
thro' various hazards and events, we move 
to latium and the realms foredoom'd by jove. 
call'd to the seat (the promise of the skies) 
where trojan kingdoms [[kingdom]] once again may rise, 
endure the hardships of your [[present]] [[state]]; 
live, and reserve yourselves for [[better]] [[fate]]." 
these words he spoke, but spoke not from his [[heart]]; 
his outward smiles conceal'd his inward smart. 
the jolly crew, unmindful of the [[past]], 
the quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste. 
some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil; 
the limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil; 
some on the [[fire]] the reeking entrails broil. 
stretch'd on the grassy turf, at ease they dine, 
restore their [[strength]] with meat, and cheer their souls [[soul]] with wine.

their [[hunger]] thus appeas'd, their [[care]] attends 
the doubtful [[fortune]] of their absent [[friends]]: 
alternate hopes [[hope]] and fears [[fear]] their minds [[mind]] possess, 
whether to deem 'em [[dead]], or in distress. 
above the rest, [[aeneas]] mourns the [[fate]] 
of brave orontes, and th' uncertain [[state]] 
of gyas, lycus, and of amycus. 
the day, but not their sorrows [[sorrow]], ended thus. 
when, from aloft, almighty jove surveys 
earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas, 
at length on libyan realms he fix'd his eyes- 
whom, pond'ring thus on [[human]] miseries, 
when [[venus]] saw, she with a lowly look, 
not [[free]] from tears, her heav'nly sire bespoke: 
"o [[king]] of gods and men! whose awful hand 
disperses thunder on the seas and [[land]], 
disposing all with absolute command; 
how could my pious [[son]] thy pow'r incense? 
or what, alas! is vanish'd troy's offense? 
our [[hope]] of [[italy]] not only lost, 
on various seas by various tempests toss'd, 
but shut from ev'ry shore, and barr'd from ev'ry coast. 
you promis'd once, a progeny [[divine]] 
of romans, rising from the trojan line, 
in after times [[time]] should hold the [[world]] in awe, 
and to the [[land]] and ocean give the [[law]]. 
how is your doom revers'd, which eas'd my [[care]] 
when troy was ruin'd in that cruel [[war]]? 
then fates [[fate]] to fates [[fate]] i could oppose; but now, 
when [[fortune]] still pursues her former blow, 
what can i [[hope]]? what worse can still succeed? 
what end of labors has your will decreed? 
antenor, from the midst of grecian hosts, 
could pass secure, and pierce th' illyrian coasts, 
where, rolling down the steep, timavus raves 
and thro' nine channels disembogues his waves. 
at length he founded padua's [[happy]] seat, 
and gave his trojans a secure retreat; 
there fix'd their arms, and there renew'd their name, 
and there in quiet rules [[rule]], and crown'd with fame. 
but we, descended from your [[sacred]] line, 
entitled to your heav'n and rites [[divine]], 
are banish'd [[earth]]; and, for the wrath of one, 
remov'd from latium and the promis'd [[throne]]. 
are these our scepters? these our due rewards [[reward]]? 
and is it thus that jove his plighted [[faith]] regards?" 
to whom the [[father]] of th' [[immortal]] [[race]], 
smiling with that serene indulgent face, 
with which he drives the clouds and clears the skies [[sky]], 
first gave a holy kiss; then thus replies: 
"daughter, dismiss thy fears [[fear]]; to thy [[desire]] 
the fates [[fate]] of thine are fix'd, and stand entire. 
thou shalt behold thy wish'd lavinian walls; 
and, ripe for heav'n, when [[fate]] [[aeneas]] calls, 
then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me: 
no councils have revers'd my firm decree. 
and, lest new fears [[fear]] disturb thy [[happy]] [[state]], 
know, i have search'd the mystic rolls of [[fate]]: 
thy [[son]] (nor is th' appointed season far) 
in [[italy]] shall wage successful [[war]], 
shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field, 
and sov'reign laws [[law]] impose, and cities [[city]] build, 
till, after ev'ry foe subdued, the sun 
thrice thro' the signs his annual [[race]] shall run: 
this is his [[time]] prefix'd. ascanius then, 
now call'd iulus, shall begin his reign. 
he thirty rolling years the [[crown]] shall wear, 
then from lavinium shall the seat transfer, 
and, with hard labor, alba longa build. 
the [[throne]] with his succession shall be fill'd 
three hundred circuits more: then shall be seen 
ilia the [[fair]], a priestess and a queen, 
who, full of [[mars]], in [[time]], with kindly throes, 
shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose. 
the [[royal]] babes a tawny wolf shall drain: 
then romulus his grandsire's [[throne]] shall gain, 
of martial tow'rs the founder shall become, 
the [[people]] romans call, the [[city]] [[rome]]. 
to them no bounds of [[empire]] i assign, 
nor term of years to their [[immortal]] line. 
ev'n haughty juno, who, with endless broils, 
earth, seas, and heav'n, and jove himself turmoils; 
at length aton'd, her friendly pow'r shall join, 
to cherish and advance the trojan line. 
the [[subject]] [[world]] shall rome's dominion own, 
and, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the gown. 
an [[age]] is ripening in revolving [[fate]] 
when troy shall overturn the grecian [[state]], 
and sweet [[revenge]] her conqu'ring sons [[son]] shall call, 
to crush the [[people]] that conspir'd her fall. 
then caesar from the julian stock shall rise, 
whose [[empire]] ocean, and whose fame the skies [[sky]] 
alone shall bound; whom, fraught with eastern spoils, 
our heav'n, the just [[reward]] of [[human]] toils, 
securely shall repay with rites [[divine]]; 
and incense shall ascend before his [[sacred]] shrine. 
then dire debate and impious [[war]] shall cease, 
and the stern [[age]] be soften'd into [[peace]]: 
then banish'd [[faith]] shall once again return, 
and vestal fires [[fire]] in hallow'd temples burn; 
and remus with quirinus shall sustain 
the righteous laws [[law]], and fraud and [[force]] restrain. 
janus himself before his fane shall wait, 
and keep the dreadful issues of his gate, 
with bolts and iron bars: within remains 
imprison'd fury, bound in brazen chains; 
high on a trophy rais'd, of useless arms, 
he sits, and threats the [[world]] with [[vain]] alarms." 
he said, and sent cyllenius with command 
to [[free]] the ports, and ope the punic [[land]] 
to trojan guests; lest, ignorant of [[fate]], 
the queen might [[force]] them from her town and [[state]]. 
down from the steep of heav'n cyllenius flies, 
and cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies [[sky]]. 
soon on the libyan shore descends the [[god]], 
performs his message, and displays his rod: 
the surly murmurs of the [[people]] cease; 
and, as the fates [[fate]] requir'd, they give the [[peace]]: 
the queen herself suspends the rigid laws [[law]], 
the trojans pities, and protects their cause. 
meantime, in shades of night [[aeneas]] lies [[lie]]: 
care seiz'd his [[soul]], and sleep forsook his [[eyes]]. 
but, when the sun restor'd the cheerful day, 
he rose, the coast and [[country]] to survey, 
anxious and eager to discover more. 
it look'd a wild uncultivated shore; 
but, whether humankind, or beasts alone 
possess'd the new-found region, was unknown. 
beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides: 
tall trees surround the mountain's shady sides; 
the bending brow above a safe retreat provides. 
arm'd with two pointed darts, he leaves his [[friends]], 
and true achates on his steps attends. 
lo! in the deep recesses of the wood, 
before his [[eyes]] his [[goddess]] [[mother]] stood: 
a huntress in her habit and her mien; 
her dress a maid, her air confess'd a queen. 
bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind; 
loose was her hair, and wanton'd in the wind; 
her hand sustain'd a bow; her quiver hung behind. 
she seem'd a virgin of the spartan [[blood]]: 
with such array harpalyce bestrode 
her thracian courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood. 
"ho, strangers! have you lately seen," she said, 
"one of my sisters, like myself array'd, 
who cross'd the lawn, or in the forest stray'd? 
a painted quiver at her back she bore; 
varied with spots, a lynx's hide she wore; 
and at full cry pursued the tusky boar." 
thus [[venus]]: thus her [[son]] replied again: 
"none of your sisters have we heard or seen, 
o virgin! or what other name you bear 
above that style- o more than mortal fair! 
your voice and mien celestial birth betray! 
if, as you seem, the sister of the day, 
or one at least of chaste diana's train, 
let not an humble suppliant sue in [[vain]]; 
but tell a stranger, long in tempests toss'd, 
what [[earth]] we tread, and who commands the coast? 
then on your name shall wretched mortals call, 
and offer'd victims at your altars fall." 
"i dare not," she replied, "assume the name 
of [[goddess]], or celestial honors claim: 
for tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear, 
and purple buskins o'er their ankles wear. 
know, gentle [[youth]], in libyan lands [[land]] you are- 
a [[people]] rude in [[peace]], and rough in [[war]]. 
the rising [[city]], which from far you see, 
is [[carthage]], and a tyrian colony. 
phoenician dido rules [[rule]] the growing [[state]], 
who fled from tyre, to shun her brother's hate. 
great were her wrongs [[wrong]], her story full of [[fate]]; 
which i will sum in short. sichaeus, known 
for [[wealth]], and [[brother]] to the punic [[throne]], 
possess'd [[fair]] dido's bed; and either [[heart]] 
at once was wounded with an [[equal]] dart. 
her [[father]] gave her, yet a spotless maid; 
pygmalion then the tyrian scepter sway'd: 
one who condemn'd [[divine]] and [[human]] laws [[law]]. 
then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause. 
the monarch, blinded with [[desire]] of [[wealth]], 
with steel invades his brother's [[life]] by stealth; 
before the [[sacred]] altar made him bleed, 
and long from her conceal'd the cruel deed. 
some tale, some new pretense, he daily coin'd, 
to soothe his sister, and delude her [[mind]]. 
at length, in [[dead]] of night, the ghost appears 
of her unhappy [[lord]]: the specter stares, 
and, with erected [[eyes]], his bloody bosom bares. 
the cruel altars and his [[fate]] he tells, 
and the dire secret of his house reveals, 
then warns the widow, with her household gods, 
to seek a refuge in remote abodes. 
last, to support her in so long a way, 
he shows her where his hidden treasure lay. 
admonish'd thus, and seiz'd with mortal fright, 
the queen provides companions of her flight: 
they meet, and all combine to leave the [[state]], 
who hate the [[tyrant]], or who [[fear]] his hate. 
they seize a fleet, which ready rigg'd they find; 
nor is pygmalion's treasure left behind. 
the vessels, heavy laden, put to sea 
with prosp'rous winds; a woman leads the way. 
i [[know]] not, if by stress of weather driv'n, 
or was their fatal course dispos'd by heav'n; 
at [[last]] they landed, where from far your [[eyes]] 
may view the turrets of new [[carthage]] rise; 
there bought a space of ground, which (byrsa call'd, 
from the bull's hide) they first inclos'd, and wall'd. 
but whence are you? what [[country]] claims your birth? 
what seek you, strangers, on our libyan [[earth]]?" 
to whom, with [[sorrow]] streaming from his [[eyes]], 
and deeply sighing, thus her [[son]] replies: 
"could you with patience hear, or i relate, 
o [[nymph]], the tedious annals of our fate! 
thro' such a train of woes if i should run, 
the day would sooner than the tale be done! 
from ancient troy, by [[force]] expell'd, we came- 
if you by [[chance]] have heard the trojan name. 
on various seas by various tempests toss'd, 
at length we landed on your libyan coast. 
the [[good]] [[aeneas]] am i call'd- a name, 
while [[fortune]] favor'd, not unknown to fame. 
my household gods, companions of my woes, 
with pious [[care]] i rescued from our foes. 
to fruitful [[italy]] my course was bent; 
and from the [[king]] of heav'n is my descent. 
with twice ten sail i cross'd the phrygian sea; 
fate and my [[mother]] [[goddess]] [[led]] my way. 
scarce sev'n, the thin remainders of my fleet, 
from storms preserv'd, within your harbor meet. 
myself distress'd, an [[exile]], and unknown, 
debarr'd from [[europe]], and from [[asia]] thrown, 
in libyan desarts wander thus alone." 
his tender parent could no longer bear; 
but, interposing, sought to soothe his [[care]]. 
"whoe'er you are- not unbelov'd by heav'n, 
since on our friendly shore your ships are driv'n- 
have [[courage]]: to the gods permit the rest, 
and to the queen expose your just request. 
now take this earnest of [[success]], for more: 
your scatter'd fleet is join'd upon the shore; 
the winds are chang'd, your [[friends]] from danger [[free]]; 
or i renounce my [[skill]] in augury. 
twelve swans behold in beauteous order move, 
and stoop with closing pinions from above; 
whom late the bird of jove had driv'n along, 
and thro' the clouds pursued the scatt'ring throng: 
now, all [[united]] in a goodly team, 
they skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream. 
as they, with joy returning, clap their wings, 
and ride the circuit of the skies [[sky]] in rings; 
not otherwise your ships, and ev'ry friend, 
already hold the port, or with swift sails descend. 
no more [[advice]] is needful; but pursue 
the path before you, and the town in view." 
thus having said, she turn'd, and made appear 
her neck refulgent, and dishevel'd hair, 
which, flowing from her shoulders, reach'd the ground. 
and widely spread ambrosial scents around: 
in length of train descends her sweeping gown; 
and, by her graceful walk, the queen of [[love]] is known. 
the [[prince]] pursued the parting deity 
with words like these: "ah! whither do you fly? 
unkind and cruel! to [[deceive]] your [[son]] 
in borrow'd shapes, and his embrace to shun; 
never to bless my sight, but thus unknown; 
and still to speak in accents not your own." 
against the [[goddess]] these complaints he made, 
but took the path, and her commands obey'd. 
they march, obscure; for [[venus]] kindly shrouds 
with mists their persons [[person]], and involves in clouds, 
that, thus unseen, their passage none might stay, 
or [[force]] to tell the causes of their way. 
this part perform'd, the [[goddess]] flies sublime 
to visit paphos and her native clime; 
where garlands, ever green and ever [[fair]], 
with vows are offer'd, and with solemn pray'r: 
a hundred altars in her temple smoke; 
a thousand bleeding hearts [[heart]] her pow'r invoke. 
they climb the next ascent, and, looking down, 
now at a nearer distance view the town. 
the [[prince]] with wonder sees the stately tow'rs, 
which late were huts and shepherds' homely bow'rs, 
the gates and streets; and hears, from ev'ry part, 
the noise and busy concourse of the mart. 
the toiling tyrians on each other call 
to ply their labor: some extend the wall; 
some build the citadel; the brawny throng 
or dig, or push unwieldly stones along. 
some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground, 
which, first design'd, with ditches they surround. 
some laws [[law]] ordain; and some attend the [[choice]] 
of holy senates, and elect by voice. 
here some design a mole, while others there 
lay deep foundations for a theater; 
from marble quarries mighty columns hew, 
for ornaments of scenes, and future view. 
such is their toil, and such their busy pains [[pain]], 
as exercise the bees in flow'ry plains, 
when winter [[past]], and summer scarce begun, 
invites them forth to labor in the sun; 
some lead their [[youth]] abroad, while some condense 
their liquid store, and some in cells dispense; 
some at the gate stand ready to receive 
the golden burthen, and their [[friends]] relieve; 
all with [[united]] [[force]], combine to drive 
the lazy drones from the laborious hive: 
with envy stung, they view each other's deeds; 
the fragrant [[work]] with diligence proceeds. 
"thrice [[happy]] you, whose walls already rise!" 
aeneas said, and view'd, with lifted [[eyes]], 
their lofty tow'rs; then, entiring at the gate, 
conceal'd in clouds (prodigious to relate) 
he mix'd, unmark'd, among the busy throng, 
borne by the tide, and pass'd unseen along. 
full in the center of the town there stood, 
thick set with trees, a venerable wood. 
the tyrians, landing near this holy ground, 
and digging here, a prosp'rous omen found: 
from under [[earth]] a courser's head they drew, 
their [[growth]] and future [[fortune]] to foreshew. 
this fated sign their foundress juno gave, 
of a soil fruitful, and a [[people]] brave. 
sidonian dido here with solemn [[state]] 
did juno's temple build, and consecrate, 
enrich'd with gifts, and with a golden shrine; 
but more the [[goddess]] made the place [[divine]]. 
on brazen steps the marble threshold rose, 
and brazen plates the cedar beams inclose: 
the rafters are with brazen cov'rings crown'd; 
the lofty doors on brazen hinges sound. 
what first [[aeneas]] this place beheld, 
reviv'd his [[courage]], and his [[fear]] expell'd. 
for while, expecting there the queen, he rais'd 
his wond'ring [[eyes]], and round the temple gaz'd, 
admir'd the [[fortune]] of the rising town, 
the striving artists, and their arts' renown; 
he saw, in order painted on the wall, 
whatever did unhappy troy befall: 
the wars [[war]] that fame around the [[world]] had blown, 
all to the [[life]], and ev'ry leader known. 
there [[agamemnon]], priam here, he spies, 
and fierce achilles, who both kings [[king]] defies. 
he stopp'd, and weeping said: "o friend! ev'n here 
the monuments of trojan woes appear! 
our known disasters fill ev'n [[foreign]] lands [[land]]: 
see there, where old unhappy priam stands! 
ev'n the mute walls relate the warrior's fame, 
and trojan griefs the tyrians' [[pity]] claim." 
he said (his tears a ready passage find), 
devouring what he saw so well design'd, 
and with an empty picture fed his [[mind]]: 
for there he saw the fainting grecians yield, 
and here the trembling trojans quit the field, 
pursued by fierce achilles thro' the plain, 
on his high chariot driving o'er the slain. 
the tents of rhesus next his [[grief]] renew, 
by their [[white]] sails betray'd to nightly view; 
and wakeful diomede, whose cruel [[sword]] 
the sentries slew, nor spar'd their slumb'ring [[lord]], 
then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food 
of troy they taste, or drink the xanthian flood. 
elsewhere he saw where troilus defied 
achilles, and unequal combat tried; 
then, where the boy disarm'd, with loosen'd reins, 
was by his horses hurried o'er the plains, 
hung by the neck and hair, and dragg'd around: 
the hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound, 
with tracks of [[blood]] inscrib'd the dusty ground. 
meantime the trojan dames, oppress'd with woe, 
to pallas' fane in long procession go, 
in hopes [[hope]] to reconcile their heav'nly foe. 
they weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair,

and [[rich]] embroider'd vests for presents [[present]] bear; 
but the stern [[goddess]] stands unmov'd with pray'r. 
thrice round the trojan walls achilles drew 
the corpse of [[hector]], whom in [[fight]] he slew. 
here priam sues; and there, for sums of gold, 
the lifeless [[body]] of his [[son]] is sold. 
so [[sad]] an object, and so well express'd, 
drew sighs and groans from the griev'd hero's breast, 
to see the figure of his lifeless friend, 
and his old sire his helpless hand extend. 
himself he saw amidst the grecian train, 
mix'd in the bloody [[battle]] on the plain; 
and swarthy memnon in his arms he knew, 
his pompous ensigns, and his [[indian]] crew. 
penthisilea there, with haughty grace, 
leads to the wars [[war]] an amazonian [[race]]: 
in their [[right]] hands a pointed dart they wield; 
the left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield. 
athwart her breast a golden belt she throws, 
amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes, 
and dares her maiden arms to manly [[force]] oppose. 
thus while the trojan [[prince]] employs his [[eyes]], 
fix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise, 
the beauteous dido, with a num'rous train 
and pomp of guards, ascends the [[sacred]] fane. 
such on eurotas' banks, or cynthus' height, 
diana seems; and so she charms the sight, 
when in the dance the graceful [[goddess]] leads 
the choir of nymphs [[nymph]], and overtops their heads: 
known by her quiver, and her lofty mien, 
she walks majestic, and she looks their queen; 
latona sees her shine above the rest, 
and feeds with secret joy her silent breast. 
such dido was; with such becoming [[state]], 
amidst the crowd, she walks serenely [[great]]. 
their labor to her future sway she speeds, 
and passing with a gracious glance proceeds; 
then mounts the [[throne]], high plac'd before the shrine: 
in crowds around, the swarming [[people]] join. 
she takes petitions, and dispenses laws [[law]], 
hears and determines ev'ry private cause; 
their tasks in [[equal]] portions she divides, 
and, where unequal, there by lots decides. 
another way by [[chance]] [[aeneas]] bends 
his [[eyes]], and unexpected sees his [[friends]], 
antheus, sergestus grave, cloanthus [[strong]], 
and at their backs a mighty trojan throng, 
whom late the tempest on the billows toss'd, 
and widely scatter'd on another coast. 
the [[prince]], unseen, surpris'd with wonder stands, 
and longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands; 
but, doubtful of the wish'd event, he stays, 
and from the hollow cloud his [[friends]] surveys, 
impatient till they told their [[present]] [[state]], 
and where they left their ships, and what their [[fate]], 
and why they came, and what was their request; 
for these were sent, commission'd by the rest, 
to sue for leave to [[land]] their sickly [[men]], 
and gain admission to the gracious queen. 
ent'ring, with cries they fill'd the holy fane; 
then thus, with lowly voice, ilioneus began: 
"o queen! indulg'd by favor of the gods 
to found an [[empire]] in these new abodes, 
to build a town, with statutes to restrain 
the wild inhabitants beneath thy reign, 
we wretched trojans, toss'd on ev'ry shore, 
from sea to sea, thy clemency implore. 
forbid the fires [[fire]] our shipping to deface! 
receive th' unhappy fugitives to grace, 
and spare the remnant of a pious race! 
we come not with design of wasteful prey, 
to drive the [[country]], [[force]] the swains away: 
nor such our [[strength]], nor such is our [[desire]]; 
the vanquish'd dare not to such thoughts [[thought]] aspire. 
a [[land]] there is, hesperia nam'd of old; 
the soil is fruitful, and the [[men]] are bold- 
th' oenotrians held it once- by [[common]] fame 
now call'd italia, from the leader's name. 
to that sweet region was our [[voyage]] bent, 
when winds and ev'ry warring element 
disturb'd our course, and, far from sight of [[land]], 
cast our torn vessels on the moving sand: 
the sea came on; the south, with mighty roar, 
dispers'd and dash'd the rest upon the rocky shore. 
those few you see escap'd the storm, and [[fear]], 
unless you interpose, a shipwreck here. 
what [[men]], what monsters, what inhuman [[race]], 
what laws [[law]], what barb'rous customs of the place, 
shut up a desart shore to drowning [[men]], 
and drive us to the cruel seas again? 
if our hard [[fortune]] no compassion draws, 
nor hospitable rights [[right]], nor [[human]] laws [[law]], 
the gods are just, and will [[revenge]] our cause. 
aeneas was our [[prince]]: a juster [[lord]], 
or nobler warrior, never drew a [[sword]]; 
observant of the [[right]], [[religious]] of his word. 
if yet he lives [[life]], and draws this vital air, 
nor we, his [[friends]], of safety shall despair; 
nor you, [[great]] queen, these offices repent, 
which he will [[equal]], and perhaps augment. 
we want not cities [[city]], nor sicilian coasts, 
where [[king]] acestes trojan lineage boasts. 
permit our ships a shelter on your shores, 
refitted from your woods with planks and oars, 
that, if our [[prince]] be safe, we may renew 
our destin'd course, and [[italy]] pursue. 
but if, o [[best]] of [[men]], the fates [[fate]] ordain 
that thou art [[arts]] swallow'd in the libyan main, 
and if our [[young]] iulus be no more, 
dismiss our navy from your friendly shore, 
that we to [[good]] acestes may return, 
and with our [[friends]] our [[common]] losses mourn." 
thus spoke ilioneus: the trojan crew 
with cries and clamors his request renew. 
the modest queen a while, with downcast [[eyes]], 
ponder'd the [[speech]]; then briefly thus replies: 
"trojans, dismiss your fears [[fear]]; my cruel [[fate]], 
and doubts [[doubt]] attending an unsettled [[state]], 
force me to guard my coast from [[foreign]] foes. 
who has not heard the story of your woes, 
the name and [[fortune]] of your native place, 
the fame and valor of the phrygian [[race]]? 
we tyrians are not so devoid of sense, 
nor so remote from phoebus' influence. 
whether to latian shores your course is bent, 
or, driv'n by tempests from your first intent, 
you seek the [[good]] acestes' [[government]], 
your [[men]] shall be receiv'd, your fleet repair'd, 
and sail, with ships of convoy for your guard: 
or, would you stay, and join your friendly pow'rs 
to raise and to defend the tyrian tow'rs, 
my [[wealth]], my [[city]], and myself are yours. 
and would to heav'n, the storm, you [[felt]], would bring 
on carthaginian coasts your wand'ring [[king]]. 
my [[people]] shall, by my command, explore 
the ports and creeks of ev'ry winding shore, 
and towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest 
of so renown'd and so desir'd a guest." 
rais'd in his [[mind]] the trojan hero stood, 
and long'd to break from out his ambient cloud: 
achates found it, and thus urg'd his way: 
"from whence, o goddess-born, this long delay? 
what more can you [[desire]], your welcome sure, 
your fleet in safety, and your [[friends]] secure? 
one only wants; and him we saw in [[vain]] 
oppose the storm, and swallow'd in the main. 
orontes in his [[fate]] our forfeit paid; 
the rest agrees with what your [[mother]] said." 
scarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way, 
the mists flew upward and dissolv'd in day. 
the trojan [[chief]] appear'd in open sight, 
august in visage, and serenely bright. 
his [[mother]] [[goddess]], with her hands [[divine]], 
had form'd his curling locks, and made his temples shine,

and giv'n his rolling [[eyes]] a sparkling grace, 
and breath'd a youthful vigor on his face; 
like polish'd ivory, beauteous to behold, 
or parian marble, when enchas'd in gold: 
thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke, 
and thus with manly modesty he spoke: 
"he whom you seek am i; by tempests toss'd, 
and sav'd from shipwreck on your libyan coast; 
presenting, gracious queen, before your [[throne]], 
a [[prince]] that owes his [[life]] to you alone. 
fair majesty, the refuge and redress 
of those whom [[fate]] pursues, and wants [[oppress]], 
you, who your pious offices employ 
to save the relics of abandon'd troy; 
receive the shipwreck'd on your friendly shore, 
with hospitable rites relieve the [[poor]]; 
associate in your town a wand'ring train, 
and strangers in your palace entertain: 
what thanks can wretched fugitives return, 
who, scatter'd thro' the [[world]], in [[exile]] mourn? 
the gods, if gods to goodness are inclin'd; 
if acts of [[mercy]] touch their heav'nly [[mind]], 
and, more than all the gods, your gen'rous [[heart]]. 
conscious of worth, requite its own desert! 
in you this [[age]] is [[happy]], and this [[earth]], 
and parents more than mortal gave you birth. 
while rolling rivers into seas shall run, 
and round the space of heav'n the radiant sun; 
while trees the mountain tops with shades supply, 
your [[honor]], name, and [[praise]] shall never [[die]]. 
whate'er abode my [[fortune]] has assign'd, 
your image shall be [[present]] in my [[mind]]." 
thus having said, he turn'd with pious haste, 
and joyful his expecting [[friends]] embrac'd: 
with his [[right]] hand ilioneus was grac'd, 
serestus with his left; then to his breast 
cloanthus and the [[noble]] gyas press'd; 
and so by turns descended to the rest. 
the tyrian queen stood fix'd upon his face, 
pleas'd with his motions, ravish'd with his grace; 
admir'd his fortunes [[fortune]], more admir'd the [[man]]; 
then recollected stood, and thus began: 
"what [[fate]], o goddess-born; what angry pow'rs 
have cast you shipwrack'd on our barren shores? 
are you the [[great]] [[aeneas]], known to fame, 
who from celestial seed your lineage claim? 
the same [[aeneas]] whom [[fair]] [[venus]] bore 
to fam'd anchises on th' idaean shore? 
it calls into my [[mind]], tho' then a child, 
when teucer came, from salamis exil'd, 
and sought my father's aid, to be restor'd: 
my [[father]] belus then with [[fire]] and [[sword]] 
invaded cyprus, made the region bare, 
and, conqu'ring, finish'd the successful [[war]]. 
from him the trojan siege i understood, 
the grecian chiefs [[chief]], and your illustrious [[blood]]. 
your foe himself the dardan valor prais'd, 
and his own ancestry from trojans rais'd. 
enter, my [[noble]] guest, and you shall find, 
if not a costly welcome, yet a [[kind]]: 
for i myself, like you, have been distress'd, 
till heav'n afforded me this place of rest; 
like you, an alien in a [[land]] unknown, 
i learn to [[pity]] woes so like my own." 
she said, and to the palace [[led]] her guest; 
then offer'd incense, and proclaim'd a feast. 
nor yet less careful for her absent [[friends]], 
twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends; 
besides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs, 
with bleating cries, attend their milky dams; 
and jars of gen'rous wine and spacious bowls 
she gives, to cheer the sailors' drooping souls [[soul]]. 
now purple hangings clothe the palace walls, 
and sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls: 
on tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine; 
with loads of massy plate the sideboards shine, 
and antique vases, all of gold emboss'd 
(the gold itself inferior to the cost), 
of [[curious]] [[work]], where on the sides were seen 
the fights and figures of illustrious [[men]], 
from their first founder to the [[present]] queen. 
the [[good]] [[aeneas]], paternal [[care]] 
iulus' absence could no longer bear, 
dispatch'd achates to the ships in haste, 
to give a glad relation of the [[past]], 
and, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy, 
snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy troy: 
a robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire; 
an upper vest, once helen's [[rich]] attire, 
from argos by the fam'd adultress brought, 
with golden flow'rs and winding foliage wrought, 
her [[mother]] leda's [[present]], when she came 
to ruin troy and set the [[world]] on flame; 
the scepter priam's eldest [[daughter]] bore, 
her orient necklace, and the [[crown]] she wore 
of double texture, glorious to behold, 
one order set with gems, and one with gold. 
instructed thus, the [[wise]] achates goes, 
and in his diligence his [[duty]] shows. 
but [[venus]], anxious for her son's affairs, 
new counsels tries, and new designs prepares: 
that cupid should assume the shape and face 
of sweet ascanius, and the sprightly grace; 
should bring the presents [[present]], in her nephew's stead, 
and in eliza's veins the gentle poison shed: 
for much she fear'd the tyrians, double-tongued, 
and knew the town to juno's [[care]] belong'd. 
these thoughts [[thought]] by night her golden slumbers broke, 
and thus alarm'd, to winged [[love]] she spoke: 
"my [[son]], my [[strength]], whose mighty pow'r alone 
controls the thund'rer on his awful [[throne]], 
to thee thy much-afflicted [[mother]] flies, 
and on thy succor and thy [[faith]] relies. 
thou know'st, my [[son]], how jove's revengeful [[wife]], 
by [[force]] and fraud, attempts thy brother's [[life]]; 
and often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains [[pain]]. 
him dido now with blandishment detains; 
but i suspect the town where juno reigns. 
for this 't is needful to prevent her art [[arts]], 
and [[fire]] with [[love]] the proud phoenician's [[heart]]: 
a [[love]] so [[violent]], so [[strong]], so sure, 
as neither [[age]] can [[change]], nor art [[arts]] can cure. 
how this may be perform'd, now take my [[mind]]: 
ascanius by his [[father]] is design'd 
to come, with presents [[present]] laden, from the port, 
to gratify the queen, and gain the court. 
i mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep, 
and, ravish'd, in idalian bow'rs to keep, 
or high cythera, that the sweet deceit 
may pass unseen, and none prevent the [[cheat]]. 
take thou his form and shape. i beg the grace 
but only for a night's revolving space: 
thyself a boy, assume a boy's dissembled face; 
that when, amidst the fervor of the feast, 
the tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast, 
and with sweet kisses in her arms constrains, 
thou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins." 
the [[god]] of [[love]] obeys, and sets aside 
his bow and quiver, and his plumy [[pride]]; 
he walks iulus in his mother's sight, 
and in the sweet resemblance takes delight. 
the [[goddess]] then to [[young]] ascanius flies, 
and in a pleasing slumber seals his [[eyes]]: 
lull'd in her lap, amidst a train of loves [[love]], 
she gently bears him to her blissful groves, 
then with a wreath of myrtle crowns [[crown]] his head, 
and softly lays him on a flow'ry bed. 
cupid meantime assum'd his form and face, 
foll'wing achates with a shorter pace, 
and brought the gifts. the queen already sate 
amidst the trojan lords [[lord]], in shining [[state]], 
high on a golden bed: her princely guest 
was next her side; in order sate the rest. 
then canisters with bread are heap'd on high; 
th' attendants water for their hands supply, 
and, having wash'd, with silken towels dry. 
next fifty handmaids in long order bore 
the censers, and with fumes the gods adore: 
then youths [[youth]], and virgins twice as many, join 
to place the dishes, and to serve the wine. 
the tyrian train, admitted to the feast, 
approach, and on the painted couches rest. 
all on the trojan gifts with wonder gaze, 
but view the beauteous boy with more amaze, 
his rosy-color'd cheeks, his radiant [[eyes]], 
his motions, voice, and shape, and all the god's [[disguise]];

nor pass unprais'd the vest and veil [[divine]], 
which wand'ring foliage and [[rich]] flow'rs entwine. 
but, far above the rest, the [[royal]] dame, 
(already doom'd to love's disastrous flame,) 
with [[eyes]] insatiate, and tumultuous joy, 
beholds the presents [[present]], and admires the boy. 
the guileful [[god]] about the hero long, 
with children's play, and false embraces, hung; 
then sought the queen: she took him to her arms 
with greedy [[pleasure]], and devour'd his charms. 
unhappy dido little [[thought]] what guest, 
how dire a [[god]], she drew so near her breast; 
but he, not mindless of his mother's pray'r, 
works in the pliant bosom of the [[fair]], 
and molds her [[heart]] anew, and blots her former [[care]]. 
the [[dead]] is to the living [[love]] resign'd; 
and all [[aeneas]] enters in her [[mind]]. 
now, when the rage of [[hunger]] was appeas'd, 
the meat remov'd, and ev'ry guest was pleas'd, 
the golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown'd, 
and thro' the palace cheerful cries resound. 
from gilded roofs depending lamps display 
nocturnal beams, that emulate the day. 
a golden bowl, that shone with gems [[divine]], 
the queen commanded to be crown'd with wine: 
the bowl that belus us'd, and all the tyrian line. 
then, [[silence]] thro' the hall proclaim'd, she spoke: 
"o hospitable jove! we thus invoke, 
with solemn rites, thy [[sacred]] name and pow'r; 
bless to both nations this auspicious hour! 
so may the trojan and the tyrian line 
in lasting concord from this day combine. 
thou, bacchus, [[god]] of joys and friendly cheer, 
and gracious juno, both be [[present]] here! 
and you, my lords [[lord]] of tyre, your vows address 
to heav'n with mine, to ratify the [[peace]]." 
the goblet then she took, with nectar crown'd 
(sprinkling the first libations on the ground,) 
and rais'd it to her mouth with sober grace; 
then, sipping, offer'd to the next in place. 
't was bitias whom she call'd, a thirsty [[soul]]; 
he took challenge, and embrac'd the bowl, 
with [[pleasure]] swill'd the gold, nor ceas'd to draw, 
till he the bottom of the brimmer saw. 
the goblet goes around: iopas brought 
his golden lyre, and sung what ancient atlas taught: 
the various labors of the wand'ring moon, 
and whence proceed th' eclipses of the sun; 
th' original of [[men]] and beasts; and whence 
the rains arise, and fires [[fire]] their warmth dispense, 
and fix'd and erring stars dispose their influence; 
what shakes the solid [[earth]]; what cause delays 
the summer nights and shortens winter days. 
with peals of shouts the tyrians [[praise]] the [[song]]: 
those peals are echo'd by the trojan throng. 
th' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd the night, 
and drank large draughts of [[love]] with vast delight; 
of priam much enquir'd, of [[hector]] more; 
then ask'd what arms the swarthy memnon wore, 
what [[troops]] he landed on the trojan shore; 
the steeds of diomede varied the discourse, 
and fierce achilles, with his matchless [[force]]; 
at length, as [[fate]] and her ill stars requir'd, 
to hear the series of the [[war]] desir'd. 
"relate at large, my godlike guest," she said, 
"the grecian stratagems, the town betray'd: 
the fatal issue of so long a [[war]], 
your flight, your wand'rings, and your woes, declare; 
for, since on ev'ry sea, on ev'ry coast, 
your [[men]] have been distress'd, your navy toss'd, 
sev'n times [[time]] the sun has either tropic view'd, 
the winter banish'd, and the spring renew'd." 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book ii

all were attentive to the godlike [[man]], 
when from his lofty couch he thus began: 
"great queen, what you command me to relate 
renews the [[sad]] remembrance of our [[fate]]: 
an [[empire]] from its old foundations rent, 
and ev'ry woe the trojans underwent; 
a peopled [[city]] made a desart place; 
all that i saw, and part of which i was: 
not ev'n the hardest of our foes could hear, 
nor stern [[ulysses]] tell without a tear. 
and now the latter watch of wasting night, 
and setting stars, to kindly rest invite; 
but, since you take such int'rest in our woe, 
and troy's disastrous end [[desire]] to [[know]], 
i will restrain my tears, and briefly tell 
what in our [[last]] and fatal night befell. 
"by [[destiny]] compell'd, and in despair, 
the greeks [[greek]] grew weary of the tedious [[war]], 
and by minerva's aid a fabric rear'd, 
which like a steed of monstrous height appear'd: 
the sides were plank'd with pine; they feign'd it made 
for their return, and this the vow they paid. 
thus they pretend, but in the hollow side 
selected numbers of their soldiers hide: 
with inward arms the dire machine they load, 
and iron bowels stuff the dark abode. 
in sight of troy lies [[lie]] tenedos, an isle 
(while [[fortune]] did on priam's [[empire]] smile) 
renown'd for [[wealth]]; but, since, a faithless bay, 
where ships expos'd to wind and weather lay. 
there was their fleet conceal'd. we [[thought]], for greece 
their sails were hoisted, and our fears [[fear]] release. 
the trojans, coop'd within their walls so long, 
unbar their gates, and issue in a throng, 
like swarming bees, and with delight survey 
the camp deserted, where the grecians lay: 
the quarters of the sev'ral chiefs [[chief]] they show'd; 
here phoenix, here achilles, made abode; 
here join'd the battles [[battle]]; there the navy rode. 
part on the pile their wond'ring [[eyes]] employ: 
the pile by pallas rais'd to ruin troy. 
thymoetes first ('t is doubtful whether hir'd, 
or so the trojan [[destiny]] requir'd) 
mov'd that the ramparts might be broken down, 
to lodge the monster fabric in the town. 
but capys, and the rest of sounder [[mind]], 
the fatal [[present]] to the flames designed, 
or to the wat'ry deep; at least to bore 
the hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore. 
the giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide, 
with noise say nothing, and in parts divide. 
laocoon, follow'd by a num'rous crowd, 
ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud: 
'o wretched countrymen! what fury reigns? 
what more than madness has possess'd your brains? 
think you the grecians from your coasts are gone? 
and are ulysses' [[arts]] no [[better]] known? 
this hollow fabric either must inclose, 
within its blind recess, our secret foes; 
or 't is an engine rais'd above the town, 
t' o'erlook the walls, and then to batter down. 
somewhat is sure design'd, by fraud or [[force]]: 
trust not their presents [[present]], nor admit the horse.' 
thus having said, against the steed he threw 
his forceful spear, which, hissing as flew, 
pierc'd thro' the yielding planks of jointed wood, 
and trembling in the hollow belly stood. 
the sides, transpierc'd, return a rattling sound, 
and groans of greeks [[greek]] inclos'd come issuing thro' the wound

and, had not heav'n the fall of troy design'd, 
or had not [[men]] been fated to be blind, 
enough was said and done t'inspire a [[better]] [[mind]]. 
then had our lances pierc'd the treach'rous wood, 
and ilian tow'rs and priam's [[empire]] stood. 
meantime, with shouts, the trojan shepherds bring 
a captive [[greek]], in bands, before the [[king]]; 
taken to take; who made himself their prey, 
t' impose on their [[belief]], and troy betray; 
fix'd on his aim, and obstinately bent 
to [[die]] undaunted, or to circumvent. 
about the captive, tides of trojans flow; 
all press to see, and some insult the foe. 
now hear how well the greeks [[greek]] their wiles disguis'd; 
behold a nation in a [[man]] compris'd. 
trembling the miscreant stood, unarm'd and bound; 
he star'd, and roll'd his haggard [[eyes]] around, 
then said: 'alas! what [[earth]] remains, what sea 
is open to receive unhappy me? 
what [[fate]] a wretched fugitive attends, 
scorn'd by my foes, abandon'd by my [[friends]]?' 
he said, and sigh'd, and cast a rueful eye: 
our [[pity]] kindles, and our [[passions]] [[die]]. 
we cheer [[youth]] to make his own defense, 
and freely tell us what he was, and whence: 
what news he could impart, we long to [[know]], 
and what to credit from a captive foe. 
"his [[fear]] at length dismiss'd, he said: 'whate'er 
my [[fate]] ordains, my words shall be sincere: 
i neither can nor dare my birth disclaim; 
greece is my [[country]], sinon is my name. 
tho' plung'd by fortune's pow'r in misery, 
't is not in fortune's pow'r to make me [[lie]]. 
if any [[chance]] has hither brought the name 
of palamedes, not unknown to fame, 
who suffer'd from the malice of the times [[time]], 
accus'd and sentenc'd for pretended crimes, 
because these fatal wars [[war]] he would prevent; 
whose [[death]] the wretched greeks [[greek]] too late lament- 
me, then a boy, my [[father]], [[poor]] and bare 
of other means, committed to his [[care]], 
his kinsman and companion in the [[war]]. 
while [[fortune]] favor'd, while his arms support 
the cause, and rul'd the counsels, of the court, 
i made some figure there; nor was my name 
obscure, nor i without my share of fame. 
but when [[ulysses]], with fallacious [[arts]], 
had made impression in the people's hearts [[heart]], 
and forg'd a [[treason]] in my patron's name 
(i speak of things too far divulg'd by fame), 
my kinsman fell. then i, without support, 
in private mourn'd his loss, and left the court. 
mad as i was, i could not bear his [[fate]] 
with silent [[grief]], but loudly blam'd the [[state]], 
and curs'd the direful author of my woes. 
't was told again; and hence my ruin rose. 
i threaten'd, if indulgent heav'n once more 
would [[land]] me safely on my native shore, 
his [[death]] with double vengeance to restore. 
this mov'd the murderer's hate; and soon ensued 
th' effects of malice from a [[man]] so proud. 
ambiguous rumors thro' the camp he spread, 
and sought, by [[treason]], my devoted head; 
new crimes [[invented]]; left unturn'd no stone, 
to make my guilt appear, and hide his own; 
till calchas was by [[force]] and threat'ning wrought- 
but why- why dwell i on that anxious [[thought]]? 
if on my nation just [[revenge]] you seek, 
and 't is t' appear a foe, t' appear a [[greek]]; 
already you my name and [[country]] [[know]]; 
assuage your thirst of [[blood]], and strike the blow: 
my [[death]] will both the kingly brothers [[brother]] please, 
and set insatiate ithacus at ease.' 
this [[fair]] unfinish'd tale, these broken starts, 
rais'd expectations in our longing hearts [[heart]]: 
unknowing as we were in grecian [[arts]]. 
his former trembling once again renew'd, 
with acted [[fear]], the villain thus pursued: 
"'long had the grecians (tir'd with fruitless [[care]], 
and wearied with an unsuccessful war) 
resolv'd to raise the siege, and leave the town; 
and, had the gods permitted, they had gone; 
but oft the wintry seas and southern winds 
withstood their passage [[home]], and chang'd their minds [[mind]]. 
portents and prodigies their souls [[soul]] amaz'd; 
but most, when this stupendous pile was rais'd: 
then flaming meteors, hung in air, were seen, 
and thunders rattled thro' a [[sky]] serene. 
dismay'd, and fearful of some dire event, 
eurypylus t' enquire their [[fate]] was sent. 
he from the gods this dreadful [[answer]] brought: 
"o grecians, when the trojan shores you sought, 
your passage with a virgin's [[blood]] was bought: 
so must your safe return be bought again, 
and grecian [[blood]] once more atone the main." 
the spreading rumor round the [[people]] ran; 
all fear'd, and each believ'd himself the [[man]]. 
ulysses took th' advantage of their fright; 
call'd calchas, and produc'd in open sight: 
then bade him name the wretch, ordain'd by [[fate]] 
the [[public]] victim, to redeem the [[state]]. 
already some presag'd the dire event, 
and saw what [[sacrifice]] [[ulysses]] meant. 
for twice five days the [[good]] old seer withstood 
th' intended [[treason]], and was dumb to [[blood]], 
till, tir'd, with endless clamors and pursuit 
of ithacus, he stood no longer mute; 
but, as it was agreed, pronounc'd that i 
was destin'd by the wrathful gods to [[die]]. 
all prais'd the sentence, pleas'd the storm should fall 
on one alone, whose fury threaten'd all. 
the dismal day was come; the priests [[priest]] prepare 
their leaven'd cakes, and fillets for my hair. 
i follow'd nature's laws [[law]], and must avow 
i broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow. 
hid in a weedy lake all night i lay, 
secure of safety when they sail'd away. 
but now what further hopes [[hope]] for me remain, 
to see my [[friends]], or native soil, again; 
my tender infants, or my careful sire, 
whom they returning will to [[death]] require; 
will perpetrate on them their first design, 
and take the forfeit of their heads for mine? 
which, o! if [[pity]] mortal minds [[mind]] can move, 
if there be [[faith]] below, or gods above, 
if innocence and [[truth]] can claim desert, 
ye trojans, from an injur'd wretch avert.' 
"false tears true [[pity]] move; the [[king]] commands 
to loose his fetters, and unbind his hands: 
then adds these friendly words: 'dismiss thy fears [[fear]]; 
forget the greeks [[greek]]; be mine as thou wert theirs. 
but truly tell, was it for [[force]] or guile, 
or some [[religious]] end, you rais'd the pile?' 
thus said the [[king]]. he, full of fraudful [[arts]], 
this well-invented tale for [[truth]] imparts: 
'ye lamps of heav'n!' he said, and lifted high 
his hands now [[free]], 'thou venerable sky! 
inviolable pow'rs, ador'd with dread! 
ye fatal fillets, that once bound this head! 
ye [[sacred]] altars, from whose flames i fled! 
be all of you adjur'd; and grant i may, 
without a crime, th' ungrateful greeks [[greek]] betray, 
reveal the secrets of the guilty [[state]], 
and justly punish whom i justly hate! 
but you, o [[king]], preserve the [[faith]] you gave, 
if i, to save myself, your [[empire]] save. 
the grecian hopes [[hope]], and all th' attempts they made, 
were only founded on minerva's aid. 
but from the [[time]] when impious diomede, 
and false [[ulysses]], that inventive head, 
her fatal image from the temple drew, 
the sleeping guardians of the castle slew, 
her virgin statue with their bloody hands 
polluted, and profan'd her holy bands; 
from thence the tide of [[fortune]] left their shore, 
and ebb'd much faster than it flow'd before: 
their [[courage]] languish'd, as their hopes [[hope]] decay'd; 
and pallas, now averse, refus'd her aid. 
nor did the [[goddess]] doubtfully declare 
her alter'd [[mind]] and alienated [[care]]. 
when first her fatal image touch'd the ground, 
she sternly cast her glaring [[eyes]] around, 
that sparkled as they roll'd, and seem'd to threat: 
her heav'nly limbs distill'd a briny sweat. 
thrice from the ground she leap'd, was seen to wield 
her brandish'd lance, and shake her horrid shield. 
then calchas bade our host for flight 
and [[hope]] no [[conquest]] from the tedious [[war]], 
till first they sail'd for greece; with pray'rs besought

her injur'd pow'r, and [[better]] omens brought. 
and now their navy plows the wat'ry main, 
yet soon expect it on your shores again, 
with pallas pleas'd; as calchas did ordain. 
but first, to reconcile the blue-ey'd maid 
for her stol'n statue and her tow'r betray'd, 
warn'd by the seer, to her offended name 
we rais'd and dedicate this wondrous frame, 
so lofty, lest thro' your forbidden gates 
it pass, and intercept our [[better]] fates [[fate]]: 
for, once admitted there, our hopes [[hope]] are lost; 
and troy may then a new palladium boast; 
for so [[religion]] and the gods ordain, 
that, if you violate with hands profane 
minerva's gift, your town in flames shall burn, 
(which omen, o ye gods, on graecia turn!) 
but if it climb, with your assisting hands, 
the trojan walls, and in the [[city]] stands; 
then troy shall argos and mycenae burn, 
and the reverse of [[fate]] on us return.' 
"with such deceits he gain'd their easy hearts [[heart]], 
too prone to credit his perfidious [[arts]]. 
what diomede, nor thetis' greater [[son]], 
a thousand ships, nor ten years' siege, had done- 
false tears and fawning words the [[city]] won. 
"a greater omen, and of worse portent, 
did our unwary minds [[mind]] with [[fear]] torment, 
concurring to [[produce]] the dire event. 
laocoon, neptune's [[priest]] by lot that year, 
with solemn pomp then sacrific'd a steer; 
when, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied 
two serpents, rank'd abreast, the seas divide, 
and smoothly sweep along the swelling tide. 
their flaming crests above the waves they show; 
their bellies seem to burn the seas below; 
their speckled tails advance to steer their course, 
and on the sounding shore the flying billows [[force]]. 
and now the strand, and now the plain they held; 
their ardent [[eyes]] with bloody streaks were fill'd; 
their nimble tongues they brandish'd as they came, 
and lick'd their hissing jaws, that sputter'd flame. 
we fled amaz'd; their destin'd way they take, 
and to laocoon and his [[children]] make; 
and first around the tender boys they wind, 
then with their sharpen'd fangs their limbs and bodies [[body]] grind.

the wretched [[father]], running to their aid 
with pious haste, but [[vain]], they next invade; 
twice round his waist their winding volumes roll'd; 
and twice about his gasping throat they fold. 
the [[priest]] thus doubly chok'd, their crests divide, 
and tow'ring o'er his head in triumph ride. 
with both his hands he labors at the knots; 
his holy fillets the blue venom blots; 
his roaring fills the flitting air around. 
thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound, 
he breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies, 
and with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies [[sky]]. 
their tasks perform'd, the serpents quit their prey, 
and to the tow'r of pallas make their way: 
couch'd at her feet, they [[lie]] protected there 
by her large buckler and protended spear. 
amazement seizes all; the gen'ral cry 
proclaims laocoon justly doom'd to [[die]], 
whose hand the will of pallas had withstood, 
and dared to violate the [[sacred]] wood. 
all vote t' admit the steed, that vows be paid 
and incense offer'd to th' offended maid. 
a spacious breach is made; the town lies [[lie]] bare; 
some hoisting-levers, some the wheels prepare 
and fasten to the horse's feet; the rest 
with cables haul along th' unwieldly beast. 
each on his fellow for assistance calls; 
at length the fatal fabric mounts the walls, 
big with destruction. boys with chaplets crown'd, 
and choirs of virgins, sing and dance around. 
thus rais'd aloft, and then descending down, 
it enters o'er our heads, and threats the town. 
o [[sacred]] [[city]], built by hands divine! 
o valiant heroes of the trojan line! 
four times [[time]] he struck: as oft the clashing sound 
of arms was heard, and inward groans rebound. 
yet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our [[fate]], 
we haul along the horse in solemn [[state]]; 
then place the dire portent within the tow'r. 
cassandra cried, and curs'd th' unhappy hour; 
foretold our [[fate]]; but, by the god's decree, 
all heard, and none believ'd the prophecy. 
with branches we the fanes adorn, and waste, 
in jollity, the day ordain'd to be the [[last]]. 
meantime the rapid heav'ns roll'd down the [[light]], 
and on the shaded ocean rush'd the night; 
our [[men]], secure, nor guards nor sentries held, 
but easy sleep their weary limbs compell'd. 
the grecians had embark'd their naval pow'rs 
from tenedos, and sought our well-known shores, 
safe under covert of the silent night, 
and guided by th' imperial galley's [[light]]; 
when sinon, favor'd by the partial gods, 
unlock'd the horse, and op'd his dark abodes; 
restor'd to vital air our hidden foes, 
who joyful from their long confinement rose. 
tysander bold, and sthenelus their guide, 
and dire [[ulysses]] down the cable slide: 
then thoas, athamas, and pyrrhus haste; 
nor was the podalirian hero [[last]], 
nor injur'd menelaus, nor the fam'd 
epeus, who the fatal engine fram'd. 
a nameless crowd succeed; their forces [[force]] join 
t' invade the town, oppress'd with sleep and wine. 
those few they find awake first meet their [[fate]]; 
then to their fellows they unbar the gate. 
"'t was in the [[dead]] of night, when sleep repairs 
our bodies [[body]] worn with toils, our minds [[mind]] with cares [[care]], 
when hector's ghost before my sight appears: 
a bloody shroud he seem'd, and bath'd in tears; 
such as he was, when, by pelides slain, 
thessalian coursers dragg'd him o'er the plain. 
swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust 
thro' the bor'd holes; his [[body]] black with dust; 
unlike that [[hector]] who return'd from toils 
of [[war]], triumphant, in aeacian spoils, 
or him who made the fainting greeks [[greek]] retire, 
and launch'd against their navy phrygian [[fire]]. 
his hair and beard stood stiffen'd with his gore; 
and all the wounds he for his [[country]] bore 
now stream'd afresh, and with new purple ran. 
i wept to see the visionary [[man]], 
and, while my trance continued, thus began: 
'o [[light]] of trojans, and support of troy, 
thy father's champion, and thy country's joy! 
o, long expected by thy friends! from whence 
art thou so late return'd for our defense? 
do we behold thee, wearied as we are 
with length of labors, and with toils of [[war]]? 
after so many fun'rals of thy own 
art thou restor'd to thy declining town? 
but say, what wounds are these? what new disgrace 
deforms the manly features of thy face?' 
"to this the specter no reply did frame, 
but answer'd to the cause for which he came, 
and, groaning from the bottom of his breast, 
this warning in these mournful words express'd: 
'o goddess-born! escape, by timely flight, 
the flames and horrors of this fatal night. 
the foes already have possess'd the wall; 
troy nods from high, and totters to her fall. 
enough is paid to priam's [[royal]] name, 
more than enough to [[duty]] and to fame. 
if by a mortal hand my father's [[throne]] 
could be defended, 't was by mine alone. 
now troy to thee commends her future [[state]], 
and gives her gods companions of thy [[fate]]: 
from their assistance walls expect, 
which, wand'ring long, at [[last]] thou shalt erect.' 
he said, and brought me, from their blest abodes, 
the venerable statues of the gods, 
with ancient vesta from the [[sacred]] choir, 
the wreaths and relics of th' [[immortal]] [[fire]]. 
"now peals of shouts come thund'ring from afar, 
cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled [[war]]: 
the noise approaches, tho' our palace stood 
aloof from streets, encompass'd with a wood. 
louder, and yet more loud, i hear th' alarms 
of [[human]] cries distinct, and clashing arms. 
fear broke my slumbers; i no longer stay, 
but mount the terrace, thence the town survey, 
and hearken what the frightful sounds convey. 
thus, when a flood of [[fire]] by wind is borne, 
crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn; 
or deluges, descending on the plains, 
sweep o'er the yellow year, [[destroy]] the pains [[pain]] 
of lab'ring oxen and the peasant's gains; 
unroot the forest oaks, and bear away 
flocks, folds, and trees, and undistinguish'd prey: 
the shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far 
the wasteful ravage of the wat'ry [[war]]. 
then hector's [[faith]] was manifestly clear'd, 
and grecian frauds in open [[light]] appear'd. 
the palace of deiphobus ascends 
in smoky flames, and catches on his [[friends]]. 
ucalegon burns next: the seas are bright 
with splendor not their own, and shine with trojan [[light]].

new clamors and new clangors now arise, 
the sound of trumpets mix'd with fighting cries. 
with frenzy seiz'd, i run to meet th' alarms, 
resolv'd on [[death]], resolv'd to [[die]] in arms, 
but first to gather [[friends]], with them t' oppose 
(if [[fortune]] favor'd) and repel the foes; 
spurr'd by my [[courage]], by my [[country]] fir'd, 
with sense of [[honor]] and [[revenge]] inspir'd. 
"pantheus, apollo's [[priest]], a [[sacred]] name, 
had scap'd the grecian swords [[sword]], and pass'd the flame: 
with relics loaden. to my doors he fled, 
and by the hand his tender grandson [[led]]. 
'what [[hope]], o pantheus? whither can we run? 
where make a stand? and what may yet be done?' 
scarce had i said, when pantheus, with a groan: 
'troy is no more, and ilium was a town! 
the fatal day, th' appointed hour, is come, 
when wrathful jove's irrevocable doom 
transfers the trojan [[state]] to grecian hands. 
the [[fire]] consumes the town, the foe commands; 
and armed hosts, an unexpected [[force]], 
break from the bowels of the fatal horse. 
within the gates, proud sinon throws about 
the flames; and foes for entrance press without, 
with thousand others, whom i [[fear]] to name, 
more than from argos or mycenae came. 
to sev'ral posts their parties they divide; 
some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide: 
the bold they kill, th' unwary they surprise; 
who fights finds [[death]], and [[death]] finds him who flies. 
the warders of the gate but scarce maintain 
th' unequal combat, and resist in [[vain]].' 
"i heard; and heav'n, that well-born souls [[soul]] inspires, 
prompts me thro' lifted swords [[sword]] and rising fires [[fire]] 
to run where clashing arms and clamor calls, 
and rush undaunted to defend the walls. 
ripheus and iph'itus by my side engage, 
for valor one renown'd, and one for [[age]]. 
dymas and hypanis by moonlight knew 
my motions and my mien, and to my party drew; 
with [[young]] coroebus, who by [[love]] was [[led]] 
to [[win]] renown and [[fair]] cassandra's bed, 
and lately brought his [[troops]] to priam's aid, 
forewarn'd in [[vain]] by the prophetic maid. 
whom when i saw resolv'd in arms to fall, 
and that one spirit animated all: 
'brave souls!' said i,- 'but brave, alas! in vain- 
come, finish what our cruel fates [[fate]] ordain. 
you see the desp'rate [[state]] of our affairs, 
and heav'n's protecting pow'rs are deaf to pray'rs. 
the passive gods behold the greeks [[greek]] defile 
their temples, and abandon to the spoil 
their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire 
to save a sinking town, involv'd in [[fire]]. 
then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes: 
despair of [[life]] the means of living shows.' 
so bold a [[speech]] incourag'd their [[desire]] 
of [[death]], and added fuel to their [[fire]]. 
"as hungry wolves, with raging appetite, 
scour thro' the fields, nor [[fear]] the stormy night- 
their whelps at [[home]] expect the promis'd food, 
and long to temper their dry chaps in blood- 
so rush'd we forth at once; resolv'd to [[die]], 
resolv'd, in [[death]], the [[last]] extremes to try. 
we leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare 
th' unequal combat in the [[public]] square: 
night was our friend; our leader was despair. 
what tongue can tell the slaughter of that night? 
what [[eyes]] can weep the sorrows [[sorrow]] and affright? 
an ancient and imperial [[city]] falls: 
the streets are fill'd with frequent funerals; 
houses and holy temples float in [[blood]], 
and hostile nations make a [[common]] flood. 
not only trojans fall; but, in their turn, 
the vanquish'd triumph, and the victors mourn. 
ours take new [[courage]] from despair and night: 
confus'd the [[fortune]] is, confus'd the [[fight]]. 
all parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears [[fear]]; 
and grisly [[death]] in sundry shapes appears. 
androgeos fell among us, with his band, 
who [[thought]] us grecians newly come to [[land]]. 
'from whence,' said he, 'my [[friends]], this long delay? 
you loiter, while the spoils are borne away: 
our ships are laden with the trojan store; 
and you, like truants, come too late ashore.' 
he said, but soon corrected his mistake, 
found, by the doubtful answers [[answer]] which we make: 
amaz'd, he would have shunn'd th' unequal [[fight]]; 
but we, more num'rous, intercept his flight. 
as when some peasant, in a bushy brake, 
has with unwary footing press'd a snake; 
he starts aside, astonish'd, when he spies 
his rising crest, blue neck, and rolling [[eyes]]; 
so from our arms surpris'd androgeos flies. 
in [[vain]]; for him and his we compass'd round, 
possess'd with [[fear]], unknowing of the ground, 
and of their lives [[life]] an easy [[conquest]] found. 
thus [[fortune]] on our first endeavor smil'd. 
coroebus then, with youthful hopes [[hope]] beguil'd, 
swoln with [[success]], and a daring [[mind]], 
this new invention fatally design'd. 
'my [[friends]],' said he, 'since [[fortune]] shows the way, 
't is fit we should th' auspicious guide obey. 
for what has she these grecian arms bestow'd, 
but their destruction, and the trojans' [[good]]? 
then [[change]] we shields, and their devices bear: 
let fraud supply the want of [[force]] in [[war]]. 
they find us arms.' this said, himself he dress'd 
in [[dead]] androgeos' spoils, his upper vest, 
his painted buckler, and his plumy crest. 
thus ripheus, dymas, all the trojan train, 
lay down their own attire, and strip the slain. 
mix'd with the greeks [[greek]], we go with ill presage, 
flatter'd with hopes [[hope]] to glut our greedy rage; 
unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet, 
and strew with grecian carcasses the street. 
thus while their straggling parties we defeat, 
some to the shore and safer ships retreat; 
and some, oppress'd with more ignoble [[fear]], 
remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there. 
"but, ah! what use of valor can be made, 
when heav'n's propitious pow'rs refuse their aid! 
behold the [[royal]] prophetess, the [[fair]] 
cassandra, dragg'd by her dishevel'd hair, 
whom not minerva's shrine, nor [[sacred]] bands, 
in safety could [[protect]] from sacrilegious hands: 
on heav'n she cast her [[eyes]], she sigh'd, she cried- 
't was all she could- her tender arms were tied. 
so [[sad]] a sight coroebus could not bear; 
but, fir'd with rage, distracted with despair, 
amid the barb'rous ravishers he flew: 
our leader's rash [[example]] we pursue. 
but storms of stones, from the proud temple's height, 
pour down, and on our batter'd helms alight: 
we from our [[friends]] receiv'd this fatal blow, 
who [[thought]] us grecians, as we seem'd in show. 
they aim at the mistaken crests, from high; 
and ours beneath the pond'rous ruin [[lie]]. 
then, mov'd with anger and disdain, to see 
their [[troops]] dispers'd, the [[royal]] virgin [[free]], 
the grecians rally, and their pow'rs unite, 
with fury charge us, and renew the [[fight]]. 
the [[brother]] kings [[king]] with ajax join their [[force]], 
and the whole squadron of thessalian horse. 
"thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try, 
contending for the [[kingdom]] of the [[sky]], 
south, east, and west, on airy coursers borne; 
the whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn: 
then nereus strikes the deep; the billows rise, 
and, mix'd with ooze and sand, pollute the skies [[sky]]. 
the [[troops]] we squander'd first again appear 
from several quarters, and enclose the rear. 
they first observe, and to the rest betray, 
our diff'rent [[speech]]; our borrow'd arms survey. 
oppress'd with odds, we fall; coroebus first, 
at pallas' altar, by peneleus pierc'd. 
then ripheus follow'd, in th' unequal [[fight]]; 
just of his word, observant of the [[right]]: 
heav'n [[thought]] not so. dymas their [[fate]] attends, 
with hypanis, mistaken by their [[friends]]. 
nor, pantheus, thee, thy miter, nor the bands 
of awful phoebus, sav'd from impious hands. 
ye trojan flames, your testimony bear, 
what i perform'd, and what i suffer'd there; 
no [[sword]] avoiding in the fatal strife, 
expos'd to [[death]], and prodigal of [[life]]; 
witness, ye heavens! i [[live]] not by my [[fault]]: 
i strove to have deserv'd the [[death]] i sought. 
but, when i could not [[fight]], and would have died, 
borne off to distance by the growing tide, 
old iphitus and i were hurried thence, 
with pelias wounded, and without defense. 
new clamors from th' invested palace ring: 
we run to [[die]], or disengage the [[king]]. 
so hot th' assault, so high the tumult rose, 
while ours defend, and while the greeks [[greek]] oppose 
as all the dardan and argolic [[race]] 
had been contracted in that narrow space; 
or as all ilium else were void of [[fear]], 
and tumult, [[war]], and slaughter, only there. 
their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes, 
secure advancing, to the turrets rose: 
some mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold, 
swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold; 
their left hand gripes their bucklers in th' ascent, 
while with their [[right]] they seize the battlement. 
from their demolish'd tow'rs the trojans throw 
huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe; 
and heavy beams and rafters from the sides 
(such arms their [[last]] necessity provides) 
and gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high, 
the marks of [[state]] and ancient royalty. 
the guards below, fix'd in the pass, attend 
the charge undaunted, and the gate defend. 
renew'd in [[courage]] with recover'd breath, 
a second [[time]] we ran to tempt our [[death]], 
to clear the palace from the foe, succeed 
the weary living, and [[revenge]] the [[dead]]. 
"a postern door, yet unobserv'd and [[free]], 
join'd by the length of a blind gallery, 
to the king's closet [[led]]: a way well known 
to hector's [[wife]], while priam held the [[throne]], 
thro' which she brought astyanax, unseen, 
to cheer his grandsire and his grandsire's queen. 
thro' this we pass, and mount the tow'r, from whence 
with unavailing arms the trojans make defense. 
from this the trembling [[king]] had oft descried 
the grecian camp, and saw their navy ride. 
beams from its lofty height with swords [[sword]] we hew, 
then, wrenching with our hands, th' assault renew; 
and, where the rafters on the columns meet, 
we push them headlong with our arms and feet. 
the lightning flies not swifter than the fall, 
nor thunder louder than the ruin'd wall: 
down goes the top at once; the greeks [[greek]] beneath 
are piecemeal torn, or pounded into [[death]]. 
yet more succeed, and more to [[death]] are sent; 
we cease not from above, nor they below relent. 
before the gate stood pyrrhus, threat'ning loud, 
with glitt'ring arms conspicuous in the crowd. 
so shines, renew'd in [[youth]], the crested snake, 
who slept the winter in a thorny brake, 
and, casting off his slough when spring returns, 
now looks aloft, and with new [[glory]] burns; 
restor'd with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides 
reflect the sun; and rais'd on spires he rides; 
high o'er the grass, hissing he rolls along, 
and brandishes by fits his forky tongue. 
proud periphas, and fierce automedon, 
his father's charioteer, together run 
to [[force]] the gate; the scyrian infantry 
rush on in crowds, and the barr'd passage [[free]]. 
ent'ring the court, with shouts the skies [[sky]] they rend; 
and flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend. 
himself, among the foremost, deals his blows, 
and with his ax repeated strokes bestows 
on the [[strong]] doors; then all their shoulders ply, 
till from the posts the brazen hinges fly. 
he hews apace; the double bars at length 
yield to his ax and unresisted [[strength]]. 
a mighty breach is made: the rooms conceal'd 
appear, and all the palace is reveal'd; 
the halls of audience, and of [[public]] [[state]], 
and where the lonely queen in secret sate. 
arm'd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen, 
with not a door, and scarce a space, between. 
the house is fill'd with loud laments and cries, 
and shrieks of [[women]] rend the vaulted skies [[sky]]; 
the fearful matrons run from place to place, 
and kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace. 
the fatal [[work]] inhuman pyrrhus plies, 
and all his [[father]] sparkles in his [[eyes]]; 
nor bars, nor fighting guards, his [[force]] sustain: 
the bars are broken, and the guards are slain. 
in rush the greeks [[greek]], and all the apartments fill; 
those few defendants whom they find, they kill. 
not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood 
roars, when he finds his rapid course withstood; 
bears down the dams with unresisted sway, 
and sweeps the cattle and the cots away. 
these [[eyes]] beheld him when he march'd between 
the [[brother]] kings [[king]]: i saw th' unhappy queen, 
the hundred wives [[wife]], and where old priam stood, 
to stain his hallow'd altar with his brood. 
the fifty nuptial beds (such hopes [[hope]] had he, 
so large a promise, of a progeny), 
the posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils, 
fell the [[reward]] of the proud victor's toils. 
where'er the raging [[fire]] had left a space, 
the grecians enter and possess the place. 
"perhaps you may of priam's [[fate]] enquire. 
he, when he saw his regal town on [[fire]], 
his ruin'd palace, and his ent'ring foes, 
on ev'ry side inevitable woes, 
in arms, disus'd, invests his limbs, decay'd, 
like them, with [[age]]; a late and useless aid. 
his feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain; 
loaded, not arm'd, he creeps along with [[pain]], 
despairing of [[success]], ambitious to be slain! 
uncover'd but by heav'n, there stood in view 
an altar; near the hearth a laurel grew, 
dodder'd with [[age]], whose boughs encompass round 
the household gods, and shade the holy ground. 
here hecuba, with all her helpless train 
of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in [[vain]]. 
driv'n like a flock of doves along the [[sky]], 
their images they hug, and to their altars fly. 
the queen, when she beheld her trembling [[lord]], 
and hanging by his side a heavy [[sword]], 
'what rage,' she cried, 'has seiz'd my husband's [[mind]]? 
what arms are these, and to what use design'd? 
these times [[time]] want other aids! were [[hector]] here, 
ev'n [[hector]] now in [[vain]], like priam, would appear. 
with us, one [[common]] shelter thou shalt find, 
or in one [[common]] [[fate]] with us be join'd.' 
she said, and with a [[last]] salute embrac'd 
the [[poor]] old [[man]], and by the laurel plac'd. 
behold! polites, one of priam's sons [[son]], 
pursued by pyrrhus, there for safety runs. 
thro' swords [[sword]] and foes, amaz'd and hurt, he flies 
thro' empty courts and open galleries. 
him pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues, 
and often reaches, and his thrusts renews. 
the [[youth]], transfix'd, with lamentable cries, 
expires before his wretched parent's [[eyes]]: 
whom gasping at his feet when priam saw, 
the [[fear]] of [[death]] gave place to nature's [[law]]; 
and, shaking more with anger than with [[age]], 
'the gods,' said he, 'requite thy brutal rage! 
as sure they will, barbarian, sure they must, 
if there be gods in heav'n, and gods be just- 
who tak'st in wrongs [[wrong]] an insolent delight; 
with a son's [[death]] t' infect a father's sight. 
not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire 
to call thee his- not he, thy vaunted sire, 
thus us'd my wretched [[age]]: the gods he fear'd, 
the laws [[law]] of [[nature]] and of nations heard. 
he cheer'd my sorrows [[sorrow]], and, for sums of gold, 
the bloodless carcass of my [[hector]] sold; 
pitied the woes a parent underwent, 
and sent me back in safety from his tent.' 
"this said, his feeble hand a javelin threw, 
which, flutt'ring, seem'd to loiter as it flew: 
just, and but barely, to the mark it held, 
and faintly tinkled on the brazen shield. 
"then pyrrhus thus: 'go thou from me to [[fate]], 
and to my [[father]] my foul deeds relate. 
now die!' with that he dragg'd the trembling sire, 
slidd'ring thro' clotter'd [[blood]] and holy mire, 
(the mingled paste his murder'd [[son]] had made,) 
haul'd from beneath the violated shade, 
and on the [[sacred]] pile the [[royal]] victim laid. 
his [[right]] hand held his bloody falchion bare, 
his left he twisted in his hoary hair; 
then, with a speeding thrust, his [[heart]] he found: 
the lukewarm [[blood]] came rushing thro' the wound, 
and sanguine streams distain'd the [[sacred]] ground. 
thus priam fell, and shar'd one [[common]] [[fate]] 
with troy in ashes, and his ruin'd [[state]]: 
he, who the scepter of all [[asia]] sway'd, 
whom monarchs like domestic slaves [[slave]] obey'd. 
on the bleak shore now lies [[lie]] th' abandon'd [[king]], 
a headless carcass, and a nameless thing. 
"then, not before, i [[felt]] my cruddled [[blood]] 
congeal with [[fear]], my hair with [[horror]] stood: 
my father's image fill'd my pious [[mind]], 
lest [[equal]] years might [[equal]] [[fortune]] find. 
again i [[thought]] on my forsaken [[wife]], 
and trembled for my son's abandon'd [[life]]. 
i look'd about, but found myself alone, 
deserted at my need! my [[friends]] were gone. 
some spent with toil, some with despair oppress'd, 
leap'd headlong from the heights; the flames consum'd the rest.

thus, wand'ring in my way, without a guide, 
the graceless helen in the porch i spied 
of vesta's temple; there she lurk'd alone; 
muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown: 
but, by the flames that cast their blaze around, 
that [[common]] bane of greece and troy i found. 
for ilium burnt, she dreads the trojan [[sword]]; 
more dreads the vengeance of her injur'd [[lord]]; 
ev'n by those gods who refug'd her abhorr'd. 
trembling with rage, the strumpet i regard, 
resolv'd to give her guilt the due [[reward]]: 
'shall she triumphant sail before the wind, 
and leave in flames unhappy troy behind? 
shall she her [[kingdom]] and her [[friends]] review, 
in [[state]] attended with a captive crew, 
while unreveng'd the [[good]] old priam falls, 
and grecian fires [[fire]] consume the trojan walls? 
for this the phrygian fields and xanthian flood 
were swell'd with bodies [[body]], and were drunk with [[blood]]? 
't is true, a soldier can small [[honor]] gain, 
and boast no [[conquest]], from a woman slain: 
yet shall the [[fact]] not pass without applause, 
of vengeance taken in so just a cause; 
the punish'd crime shall set my [[soul]] at ease, 
and murm'ring manes of my [[friends]] appease.' 
thus while i rave, a gleam of pleasing [[light]] 
spread o'er the place; and, shining heav'nly bright, 
my [[mother]] stood reveal'd before my sight 
never so radiant did her [[eyes]] appear; 
not her own star confess'd a [[light]] so clear: 
great in her charms, as when on gods above 
she looks, and breathes herself into their [[love]]. 
she held my hand, the destin'd blow to break; 
then from her rosy lips began to speak: 
'my [[son]], from whence this madness, this neglect 
of my commands, and those whom i [[protect]]? 
why this unmanly rage? recall to [[mind]] 
whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind. 
look if your helpless [[father]] yet survive, 
or if ascanius or creusa [[live]]. 
around your house the greedy grecians err; 
and these had perish'd in the nightly [[war]], 
but for my presence and protecting [[care]]. 
not helen's face, nor [[paris]], was in [[fault]]; 
but by the gods was this destruction brought. 
now cast your [[eyes]] around, while i dissolve 
the mists and films that mortal [[eyes]] involve, 
purge from your sight the dross, and make you see 
the shape of each avenging deity. 
enlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil, 
nor [[fear]] [[obedience]] to your mother's will. 
where yon disorder'd heap of ruin lies [[lie]], 
stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise- 
amid that smother [[neptune]] holds his place, 
below the wall's foundation drives his mace, 
and heaves the building from the solid base. 
look where, in arms, imperial juno stands 
full in the scaean gate, with loud commands, 
urging on shore the tardy grecian bands. 
see! pallas, of her snaky buckler proud, 
bestrides the tow'r, refulgent thro' the cloud: 
see! jove new [[courage]] to the foe supplies, 
and arms against the town the partial deities. 
haste hence, my [[son]]; this fruitless labor end: 
haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend: 
haste; and a mother's [[care]] your passage shall befriend.'

she said, and swiftly vanish'd from my sight, 
obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night. 
i look'd, i listen'd; dreadful sounds i hear; 
and the dire forms of hostile gods appear. 
troy sunk in flames i saw (nor could prevent), 
and ilium from its old foundations rent; 
rent like a mountain ash, which dar'd the winds, 
and stood the sturdy strokes of lab'ring hinds. 
about the roots the cruel ax resounds; 
the stumps are pierc'd with oft-repeated wounds: 
the [[war]] is [[felt]] on high; the nodding [[crown]] 
now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honors down. 
to their [[united]] [[force]] it yields, tho' late, 
and mourns with mortal groans th' approaching [[fate]]: 
the roots no more their upper load sustain; 
but down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro' the plain. 
"descending thence, i scape thro' foes and [[fire]]: 
before the [[goddess]], foes and flames retire. 
arriv'd at [[home]], he, for whose only sake, 
or most for his, such toils i undertake, 
the [[good]] anchises, whom, by timely flight, 
i purpos'd to secure on ida's height, 
refus'd the [[journey]], resolute to [[die]] 
and add his fun'rals to the [[fate]] of troy, 
rather than [[exile]] and old [[age]] sustain. 
'go you, whose [[blood]] runs warm in ev'ry vein. 
had heav'n decreed that i should [[life]] enjoy, 
heav'n had decreed to save unhappy troy. 
't is, sure, enough, if not too much, for one, 
twice to have seen our ilium overthrown. 
make haste to save the [[poor]] remaining crew, 
and give this useless corpse a long adieu. 
these [[weak]] old hands suffice to stop my breath; 
at least the pitying foes will aid my [[death]], 
to take my spoils, and leave my [[body]] bare: 
as for my sepulcher, let heav'n take [[care]]. 
't is long since i, for my celestial [[wife]] 
loath'd by the gods, have dragg'd a ling'ring [[life]]; 
since ev'ry hour and moment i expire, 
blasted from heav'n by jove's avenging [[fire]].' 
this oft repeated, he stood fix'd to [[die]]: 
myself, my [[wife]], my [[son]], my [[family]], 
intreat, [[pray]], beg, and raise a doleful cry- 
'what, will he still persist, on [[death]] resolve, 
and in his ruin all his house involve!' 
he still persists his reasons [[reason]] to maintain; 
our pray'rs, our tears, our loud laments, are [[vain]]. 
"urg'd by despair, again i go to try 
the [[fate]] of arms, resolv'd in [[fight]] to [[die]]: 
'what [[hope]] remains, but what my [[death]] must give? 
can i, without so dear a [[father]], [[live]]? 
you term it prudence, what i baseness call: 
could such a word from such a parent fall? 
if [[fortune]] please, and so the gods ordain, 
that nothing should of ruin'd troy remain, 
and you conspire with [[fortune]] to be slain, 
the way to [[death]] is wide, th' approaches near: 
for soon relentless pyrrhus will appear, 
reeking with priam's blood- the wretch who slew 
the [[son]] (inhuman) in the father's view, 
and then the sire himself to the dire altar drew. 
o [[goddess]] [[mother]], give me back to [[fate]]; 
your gift was undesir'd, and came too late! 
did you, for this, unhappy me convey 
thro' foes and fires [[fire]], to see my house a prey? 
shall i my [[father]], [[wife]], and [[son]] behold, 
welt'ring in [[blood]], each other's arms infold? 
haste! gird my [[sword]], tho' spent and overcome: 
't is the [[last]] summons to receive our doom. 
i hear thee, [[fate]]; and i obey thy call! 
not unreveng'd the foe shall see my fall. 
restore me to the yet unfinish'd [[fight]]: 
my [[death]] is wanting to conclude the night.' 
arm'd once again, my glitt'ring [[sword]] i wield, 
while th' other hand sustains my weighty shield, 
and forth i rush to seek th' abandon'd field. 
i went; but [[sad]] creusa stopp'd my way, 
and cross the threshold in my passage lay, 
embrac'd my knees, and, when i would have gone, 
shew'd me my feeble sire and tender [[son]]: 
'if [[death]] be your design, at least,' said she, 
'take us along to share your [[destiny]]. 
if any farther hopes [[hope]] in arms remain, 
this place, these pledges of your [[love]], maintain. 
to whom do you expose your father's [[life]], 
your son's, and mine, your now forgotten wife!' 
while thus she fills the house with clam'rous cries, 
our hearing is diverted by our [[eyes]]: 
for, while i held my [[son]], in the short space 
betwixt our kisses and our [[last]] embrace; 
strange to relate, from [[young]] iulus' head 
a lambent flame arose, which gently spread 
around his brows, and on his temples fed. 
amaz'd, with running water we prepare 
to quench the [[sacred]] [[fire]], and slake his hair; 
but old anchises, vers'd in omens, rear'd 
his hands to heav'n, and this request preferr'd: 
'if any vows, almighty jove, can bend 
thy will; if piety can pray'rs commend, 
confirm the glad presage which thou art [[arts]] pleas'd to send.'

scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear 
a peal of rattling thunder roll in air: 
there shot a streaming lamp along the [[sky]], 
which on the winged lightning seem'd to fly; 
from o'er the roof the blaze began to move, 
and, trailing, vanish'd in th' idaean grove. 
it swept a path in heav'n, and shone a guide, 
then in a steaming stench of sulphur died. 
"the [[good]] old [[man]] with suppliant hands implor'd 
the gods' protection, and their star ador'd. 
'now, now,' said he, 'my [[son]], no more delay! 
i yield, i [[follow]] where heav'n shews the way. 
keep, o my [[country]] gods, our dwelling place, 
and guard this relic of the trojan [[race]], 
this tender child! these omens are your own, 
and you can yet restore the ruin'd town. 
at least accomplish what your signs foreshow: 
i stand resign'd, and am prepar'd to go.' 
"he said. the crackling flames appear on high. 
and driving sparkles dance along the [[sky]]. 
with vulcan's rage the rising winds conspire, 
and near our palace roll the flood of [[fire]]. 
'haste, my dear [[father]], ('t is no [[time]] to wait,) 
and load my shoulders with a willing freight. 
whate'er befalls, your [[life]] shall be my [[care]]; 
one [[death]], or one deliv'rance, we will share. 
my hand shall lead our little [[son]]; and you, 
my faithful consort, shall our steps pursue. 
next, you, my servants, heed my strict commands: 
without the walls a ruin'd temple stands, 
to ceres hallow'd once; a cypress nigh 
shoots up her venerable head on high, 
by long [[religion]] kept; there bend your feet, 
and in divided parties let us meet. 
our [[country]] gods, the relics, and the bands, 
hold you, my [[father]], in your guiltless hands: 
in me 't is impious holy things to bear, 
red as i am with slaughter, new from [[war]], 
till in some living stream i cleanse the guilt 
of dire debate, and [[blood]] in [[battle]] spilt.' 
thus, ord'ring all that prudence could provide, 
i clothe my shoulders with a lion's hide 
and yellow spoils; then, on my bending back, 
the welcome load of my dear [[father]] take; 
while on my [[better]] hand ascanius hung, 
and with unequal paces tripp'd along. 
creusa kept behind; by [[choice]] we stray 
thro' ev'ry dark and ev'ry devious way. 
i, who so bold and dauntless, just before, 
the grecian darts and shock of lances bore, 
at ev'ry shadow now am seiz'd with [[fear]], 
not for myself, but for the charge i bear; 
till, near the ruin'd gate arriv'd at [[last]], 
secure, and deeming all the danger [[past]], 
a frightful noise of trampling feet we hear. 
my [[father]], looking thro' the shades, with [[fear]], 
cried out: 'haste, haste, my [[son]], the foes are nigh; 
their swords [[sword]] and shining armor i descry.' 
some hostile [[god]], for some unknown offense, 
had sure bereft my [[mind]] of [[better]] sense; 
for, while thro' winding ways i took my flight, 
and sought the shelter of the gloomy night, 
alas! i lost creusa: hard to tell 
if by her fatal [[destiny]] she fell, 
or weary sate, or wander'd with affright; 
but she was lost for ever to my sight. 
i knew not, or reflected, till i meet 
my [[friends]], at ceres' now deserted seat. 
we met: not one was wanting; only she 
deceiv'd her [[friends]], her [[son]], and wretched me. 
"what mad expressions did my tongue refuse! 
whom did i not, of gods or [[men]], accuse! 
this was the fatal blow, that pain'd me more 
than all i [[felt]] from ruin'd troy before. 
stung with my loss, and raving with despair, 
abandoning my now forgotten [[care]], 
of counsel, comfort, and of [[hope]] bereft, 
my sire, my [[son]], my [[country]] gods i left. 
in shining armor once again i sheathe 
my limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing [[death]]. 
then headlong to the burning walls i run, 
and seek the danger i was forc'd to shun. 
i tread my former tracks; thro' night explore 
each passage, ev'ry street i cross'd before. 
all things were full of [[horror]] and affright, 
and dreadful ev'n the [[silence]] of the night. 
then to my father's house i make repair, 
with some small glimpse of [[hope]] to find her there. 
instead of her, the cruel greeks [[greek]] i met; 
the house was fill'd with foes, with flames beset. 
driv'n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of [[fire]], 
thro' air transported, to the roofs aspire. 
from thence to priam's palace i resort, 
and search the citadel and desart court. 
then, unobserv'd, i pass by juno's [[church]]: 
a guard of grecians had possess'd the porch; 
there phoenix and [[ulysses]] watch prey, 
and thither all the [[wealth]] of troy convey: 
the spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought, 
and golden bowls from burning altars caught, 
the tables of the gods, the purple vests, 
the people's treasure, and the pomp of priests [[priest]]. 
a rank of wretched youths [[youth]], with pinion'd hands, 
and captive matrons, in long order stands. 
then, with ungovern'd madness, i proclaim, 
thro' all the silent street, creusa's name: 
creusa still i call; at length she hears, 
and sudden thro' the shades of night appears- 
appears, no more creusa, nor my [[wife]], 
but a pale specter, larger than the [[life]]. 
aghast, astonish'd, and struck dumb with [[fear]], 
i stood; like bristles rose my stiffen'd hair. 
then thus the ghost began to soothe my [[grief]] 
'nor tears, nor cries, can give the [[dead]] relief. 
desist, my much-lov'd [[lord]],'t indulge your [[pain]]; 
you bear no more than what the gods ordain. 
my fates [[fate]] permit me not from hence to fly; 
nor he, the [[great]] controller of the [[sky]]. 
long wand'ring ways for you the pow'rs decree; 
on [[land]] hard labors, and a length of sea. 
then, after many painful years are [[past]], 
on latium's [[happy]] shore you shall be cast, 
where gentle tiber from his bed beholds 
the flow'ry meadows, and the feeding folds. 
there end your toils; and there your fates [[fate]] provide 
a quiet [[kingdom]], and a [[royal]] bride: 
there [[fortune]] shall the trojan line restore, 
and you for lost creusa weep no more. 
fear not that i shall watch, with servile shame, 
th' imperious looks of some proud grecian dame; 
or, stooping to the victor's [[lust]], disgrace 
my [[goddess]] [[mother]], or my [[royal]] [[race]]. 
and now, farewell! the parent of the gods 
restrains my fleeting [[soul]] in her abodes: 
i trust our [[common]] issue to your [[care]].' 
she said, and gliding pass'd unseen in air. 
i strove to speak: but [[horror]] tied my tongue; 
and thrice about her neck my arms i flung, 
and, thrice deceiv'd, on [[vain]] embraces hung. 
light as an empty [[dream]] at break of day, 
or as a blast of wind, she rush'd away. 
"thus having pass'd the night in fruitless [[pain]], 
i to my longing [[friends]] return again, 
amaz'd th' augmented number to behold, 
of [[men]] and matrons mix'd, of [[young]] and old; 
a wretched exil'd crew together brought, 
with arms appointed, and with treasure fraught, 
resolv'd, and willing, under my command, 
to run all hazards both of sea and [[land]]. 
the morn began, from ida, to display 
her rosy cheeks; and phosphor [[led]] the day: 
before the gates the grecians took their post, 
and all pretense of late relief was lost. 
i yield to [[fate]], unwillingly retire, 
and, loaded, up the hill convey my sire."

book iii

"when heav'n had overturn'd the trojan [[state]] 
and priam's [[throne]], by too severe a [[fate]]; 
when ruin'd troy became the grecians' prey, 
and ilium's lofty tow'rs in ashes lay; 
warn'd by celestial omens, we retreat, 
to seek in [[foreign]] lands [[land]] a happier seat. 
near old antandros, and at ida's foot, 
the timber of the [[sacred]] groves we cut, 
and build our fleet; uncertain yet to find 
what place the gods for our repose assign'd. 
friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring 
began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing, 
when old anchises summon'd all to sea: 
the crew my [[father]] and the fates [[fate]] obey. 
with sighs and tears i leave my native shore, 
and empty fields, where ilium stood before. 
my sire, my [[son]], our less and greater gods, 
all sail at once, and cleave the briny floods. 
"against our coast appears a spacious [[land]], 
which once the fierce lycurgus did command, 
(thracia the name- the [[people]] bold in [[war]]; 
vast are their fields, and tillage is their [[care]],) 
a hospitable realm while [[fate]] was [[kind]], 
with troy in [[friendship]] and [[religion]] join'd. 
i [[land]]; with luckless omens then adore 
their gods, and draw a line along the shore; 
i lay the deep foundations of a wall, 
and aenos, nam'd from me, the [[city]] call. 
to dionaean [[venus]] vows are paid, 
and all the pow'rs that rising labors aid; 
a bull on jove's imperial altar laid. 
not far, a rising hillock stood in view; 
sharp myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew. 
there, while i went to crop the sylvan scenes, 
and shade our altar with their leafy greens, 
i pull'd a plant- with [[horror]] i relate 
a prodigy so [[strange]] and full of [[fate]]. 
the rooted fibers rose, and from the wound 
black bloody drops distill'd upon the ground. 
mute and amaz'd, my hair with terror stood; 
fear shrunk my sinews, and congeal'd my [[blood]]. 
mann'd once again, another plant i try: 
that other gush'd with the same sanguine dye. 
then, fearing guilt for some offense unknown, 
with pray'rs and vows the dryads i atone, 
with all the sisters of the woods, and most 
the [[god]] of arms, who rules [[rule]] the thracian coast, 
that they, or he, these omens would avert, 
release our fears [[fear]], and [[better]] signs impart. 
clear'd, as i [[thought]], and fully fix'd at length 
to learn the cause, i tugged with all my [[strength]]: 
i bent my knees against the ground; once more 
the violated myrtle ran with gore. 
scarce dare i tell the sequel: from the womb 
of wounded [[earth]], and caverns of the tomb, 
a groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew'd 
my fright, and then these dreadful words ensued: 
'why dost thou thus my buried [[body]] rend? 
o spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend! 
spare to pollute thy pious hands with [[blood]]: 
the tears distil not from the wounded wood; 
but ev'ry drop this living tree contains 
is kindred [[blood]], and ran in trojan veins. 
o fly from this unhospitable shore, 
warn'd by my [[fate]]; for i am polydore! 
here loads of lances, in my [[blood]] embrued, 
again shoot upward, by my [[blood]] renew'd.' 
"my falt'ring tongue and shiv'ring limbs declare 
my [[horror]], and in bristles rose my hair. 
when troy with grecian arms was closely pent, 
old priam, fearful of the war's event, 
this hapless polydore to thracia sent: 
loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far 
from noise and tumults, and destructive [[war]], 
committed to the faithless tyrant's [[care]]; 
who, when he saw the pow'r of troy decline, 
forsook the weaker, with the [[strong]] to join; 
broke ev'ry bond of [[nature]] and of [[truth]], 
and murder'd, for his [[wealth]], the [[royal]] [[youth]]. 
o [[sacred]] [[hunger]] of pernicious gold! 
what bands of [[faith]] can impious lucre hold? 
now, when my [[soul]] had shaken off her fears [[fear]], 
i call my [[father]] and the trojan peers; 
relate the prodigies of heav'n, require 
what he commands, and their [[advice]] [[desire]]. 
all vote to leave that execrable shore, 
polluted with the [[blood]] of polydore; 
but, ere we sail, his fun'ral rites prepare, 
then, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear. 
in mournful pomp the matrons walk the round, 
with baleful cypress and blue fillets crown'd, 
with [[eyes]] dejected, and with hair unbound. 
then bowls of tepid milk and [[blood]] we pour, 
and thrice invoke the [[soul]] of polydore. 
"now, when the raging storms no longer reign, 
but southern gales invite us to the main, 
we launch our vessels, with a prosp'rous wind, 
and leave the cities [[city]] and the shores behind. 
"an island in th' aegaean main appears; 
neptune and wat'ry doris claim it theirs. 
it floated once, till phoebus fix'd the sides 
to rooted [[earth]], and now it braves the tides. 
here, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore, 
with needful ease our weary limbs restore, 
and the sun's temple and his town adore. 
"anius, the [[priest]] and [[king]], with laurel crown'd, 
his hoary locks with purple fillets bound, 
who saw my sire the delian shore ascend, 
came forth with eager haste to meet his friend; 
invites him to his palace; and, in sign 
of ancient [[love]], their plighted hands they join. 
then to the temple of the [[god]] i went, 
and thus, before the shrine, my vows [[present]]: 
'give, o thymbraeus, give a resting place 
to the [[sad]] relics of the trojan [[race]]; 
a seat secure, a region of their own, 
a lasting [[empire]], and a happier town. 
where shall we fix? where shall our labors end? 
whom shall we [[follow]], and what [[fate]] attend? 
let not my pray'rs a doubtful [[answer]] find; 
but in clear auguries unveil thy [[mind]].' 
scarce had i said: he shook the holy ground, 
the laurels, and the lofty hills around; 
and from the tripos rush'd a bellowing sound. 
prostrate we fell; confess'd the [[present]] [[god]], 
who gave this [[answer]] from his dark abode: 
'undaunted youths [[youth]], go, seek that [[mother]] [[earth]] 
from which your [[ancestors]] derive their birth. 
the soil that sent you forth, her ancient [[race]] 
in her old bosom shall again embrace. 
thro' the wide [[world]] th' aeneian house shall reign, 
and children's [[children]] shall the [[crown]] sustain.' 
thus phoebus did our future fates [[fate]] disclose: 
a mighty tumult, mix'd with joy, arose. 
"all are concern'd to [[know]] what place the [[god]] 
assign'd, and where determin'd our abode. 
my [[father]], long revolving in his [[mind]] 
the [[race]] and lineage of the trojan [[kind]], 
thus answer'd their demands: 'ye princes [[prince]], hear 
your pleasing [[fortune]], and dispel your [[fear]]. 
the fruitful isle of crete, well known to fame, 
sacred of old to jove's imperial name, 
in the mid ocean lies [[lie]], with large command, 
and on its plains a hundred cities [[city]] stand. 
another ida rises there, and we 
from thence derive our trojan ancestry. 
from thence, as 't is divulg'd by [[certain]] fame, 
to the rhoetean shores old teucrus came; 
there fix'd, and there the seat of [[empire]] chose, 
ere ilium and the trojan tow'rs arose. 
in humble vales they built their soft abodes, 
till cybele, the [[mother]] of the gods, 
with tinkling cymbals charm'd th' idaean woods, 
she secret rites and ceremonies [[ceremony]] taught, 
and to the yoke the savage lions brought. 
let us the [[land]] which heav'n appoints, explore; 
appease the winds, and seek the gnossian shore. 
if jove assists the passage of our fleet, 
the third propitious dawn discovers crete.' 
thus having said, the sacrifices [[sacrifice]], laid 
on smoking altars, to the gods he paid: 
a bull, to [[neptune]] an oblation due, 
another bull to bright [[apollo]] slew; 
a milk-white ewe, the western winds to please, 
and one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas. 
ere this, a flying rumor had been spread 
that fierce idomeneus from crete was fled, 
expell'd and exil'd; that the coast was [[free]] 
from [[foreign]] or domestic [[enemy]]. 
"we leave the delian ports, and put to sea; 
by naxos, fam'd for vintage, make our way; 
then green donysa pass; and sail in sight 
of paros' isle, with marble quarries [[white]]. 
we pass the scatter'd isles of cyclades, 
that, scarce distinguish'd, seem to stud the seas. 
the shouts of sailors double near the shores; 
they stretch their canvas, and they ply their oars. 
'all hands aloft! for crete! for crete!' they cry, 
and swiftly thro' the foamy billows fly. 
full on the promis'd [[land]] at length we bore, 
with joy descending on the cretan shore. 
with eager haste a rising town i frame, 
which from the trojan pergamus i name: 
the name itself was grateful; i exhort 
to found their houses, and erect a fort. 
our ships are haul'd upon the yellow strand; 
the [[youth]] begin to till the labor'd [[land]]; 
and i myself new marriages [[marriage]] promote, 
give laws [[law]], and dwellings i divide by lot; 
when rising vapors choke the wholesome air, 
and blasts of noisome winds [[corrupt]] the year; 
the trees devouring caterpillars burn; 
parch'd was the grass, and blighted was the corn: 
nor 'scape the beasts; for sirius, from on high, 
with pestilential heat infects the [[sky]]: 
my men- some fall, the rest in fevers fry. 
again my [[father]] bids me seek the shore 
of [[sacred]] delos, and the [[god]] implore, 
to learn what end of woes we might expect, 
and to what clime our weary course direct. 
"'t was night, when ev'ry creature, void of cares [[care]], 
the [[common]] gift of balmy slumber shares: 
the statues of my gods (for such they seem'd), 
those gods whom i from flaming troy redeem'd, 
before me stood, majestically bright, 
full in the beams of phoebe's ent'ring [[light]]. 
then thus they spoke, and eas'd my troubled [[mind]]: 
'what from the delian [[god]] thou go'st to find, 
he tells thee here, and sends us to relate. 
those pow'rs are we, companions of thy [[fate]], 
who from the burning town by thee were brought, 
thy [[fortune]] follow'd, and thy safety wrought. 
thro' seas and lands [[land]] as we thy steps attend, 
so shall our [[care]] thy glorious [[race]] befriend. 
an ample realm for thee thy fates [[fate]] ordain, 
a town that o'er the conquer'd [[world]] shall reign. 
thou, mighty walls for mighty nations build; 
nor let thy weary [[mind]] to labors yield: 
but [[change]] thy seat; for not the delian [[god]], 
nor we, have giv'n thee crete for our abode. 
a [[land]] there is, hesperia call'd of old, 
(the soil is fruitful, and the natives bold- 
th' oenotrians held it once,) by later fame 
now call'd italia, from the leader's name. 
lasius there and dardanus were born; 
from thence we came, and thither must return. 
rise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet. 
search [[italy]]; for jove denies thee crete.' 
"astonish'd at their voices and their sight, 
(nor were they dreams [[dream]], but visions of the night; 
i saw, i knew their faces, and descried, 
in [[perfect]] view, their hair with fillets tied;) 
i started from my couch; a clammy sweat 
on all my limbs and shiv'ring [[body]] sate. 
to heav'n i lift my hands with pious haste, 
and [[sacred]] incense in the flames i cast. 
thus to the gods their [[perfect]] honors done, 
more cheerful, to my [[good]] old sire i run, 
and tell the pleasing news. in little space 
he found his error of the double [[race]]; 
not, as before he deem'd, deriv'd from crete; 
no more deluded by the doubtful seat: 
then said: 'o [[son]], turmoil'd in trojan fate! 
such things as these cassandra did relate. 
this day revives within my [[mind]] what she 
foretold of troy renew'd in [[italy]], 
and latian lands [[land]]; but who could then have [[thought]] 
that phrygian gods to latium should be brought, 
or who believ'd what mad cassandra taught? 
now let us go where phoebus leads the way.' 
"he said; and we with glad [[consent]] obey, 
forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind, 
we spread our sails before the willing wind. 
now from the sight of [[land]] our galleys move, 
with only seas around and skies [[sky]] above; 
when o'er our heads descends a burst of rain, 
and night with sable clouds involves the main; 
the ruffling winds the foamy billows raise; 
the scatter'd fleet is forc'd to sev'ral ways; 
the face of heav'n is ravish'd from our [[eyes]], 
and in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies. 
cast from our course, we wander in the dark. 
no stars to guide, no point of [[land]] to mark. 
ev'n palinurus no distinction found 
betwixt the night and day; such darkness reign'd around.

three starless nights the doubtful navy strays, 
without distinction, and three sunless days; 
the fourth renews the [[light]], and, from our shrouds, 
we view a rising [[land]], like distant clouds; 
the mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight, 
and curling smoke ascending from their height. 
the canvas falls; their oars the sailors ply; 
from the rude strokes the whirling waters fly. 
at length i [[land]] upon the strophades, 
safe from the danger of the stormy seas. 
those isles are compass'd by th' ionian main, 
the dire abode where the foul harpies reign, 
forc'd by the winged warriors to repair 
to their old homes [[home]], and leave their costly fare. 
monsters more fierce offended heav'n ne'er sent 
from hell's abyss, for [[human]] [[punishment]]: 
with virgin faces, but with wombs obscene, 
foul paunches, and with ordure still unclean; 
with claws for hands, and looks for ever lean. 
"we landed at the port, and soon beheld 
fat herds of oxen graze the flow'ry field, 
and wanton goats without a keeper stray'd. 
with [[weapons]] we the welcome prey invade, 
then call the gods for partners of our feast, 
and jove himself, the [[chief]] invited guest. 
we spread the tables on the greensward ground; 
we feed with [[hunger]], and the bowls go round; 
when from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry, 
and clatt'ring wings, the hungry harpies fly; 
they snatch the meat, defiling all they find, 
and, parting, leave a loathsome stench behind. 
close by a hollow rock, again we sit, 
new dress the dinner, and the beds refit, 
secure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade, 
where tufted trees a native arbor made. 
again the holy fires [[fire]] on altars burn; 
and once again the rav'nous birds return, 
or from the dark recesses where they [[lie]], 
or from another quarter of the [[sky]]; 
with filthy claws their odious meal repeat, 
and mix their loathsome ordures with their meat. 
i bid my [[friends]] for vengeance then prepare, 
and with the hellish nation wage the [[war]]. 
they, as commanded, for the [[fight]] provide, 
and in the grass their glitt'ring [[weapons]] hide; 
then, when along the crooked shore we hear 
their clatt'ring wings, and saw the foes appear, 
misenus sounds a charge: we take th' alarm, 
and our [[strong]] hands with swords [[sword]] and bucklers arm. 
in this new [[kind]] of combat all employ 
their utmost [[force]], the monsters to [[destroy]]. 
in vain- the fated skin is proof to wounds; 
and from their plumes the shining [[sword]] rebounds. 
at length rebuff'd, they leave their mangled prey, 
and their stretch'd pinions to the skies [[sky]] display. 
yet one remain'd- the messenger of [[fate]]: 
high on a craggy cliff celaeno sate, 
and thus her dismal errand did relate: 
'what! not contented with our oxen slain, 
dare you with heav'n an impious [[war]] maintain, 
and drive the harpies from their native reign? 
heed therefore what i say; and keep in [[mind]] 
what jove decrees, what phoebus has design'd, 
and i, the furies' queen, from both relate- 
you seek th' italian shores, foredoom'd by [[fate]]: 
th' italian shores are granted you to find, 
and a safe passage to the port assign'd. 
but [[know]], that ere your promis'd walls you build, 
my curses shall severely be fulfill'd. 
fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed, 
reduc'd to grind the plates on which you feed.' 
she said, and to the neighb'ring forest flew. 
our [[courage]] fails us, and our fears [[fear]] renew. 
hopeless to [[win]] by [[war]], to pray'rs we fall, 
and on th' offended harpies humbly call, 
and whether gods or birds obscene they were, 
our vows for pardon and for [[peace]] prefer. 
but old anchises, off'ring [[sacrifice]], 
and lifting up to heav'n his hands and [[eyes]], 
ador'd the greater gods: 'avert,' said he, 
'these omens; render [[vain]] this prophecy, 
and from th' impending curse a pious [[people]] free!' 
"thus having said, he bids us put to sea; 
we loose from shore our haulsers, and obey, 
and soon with swelling sails pursue the wat'ry way. 
amidst our course, zacynthian woods appear; 
and next by rocky neritos we steer: 
we fly from ithaca's detested shore, 
and curse the [[land]] which dire [[ulysses]] bore. 
at length leucate's cloudy top appears, 
and the sun's temple, which the sailor fears [[fear]]. 
resolv'd to breathe a while from labor [[past]], 
our crooked anchors from the prow we cast, 
and joyful to the little [[city]] haste. 
here, safe beyond our hopes [[hope]], our vows we [[pay]] 
to jove, the guide and patron of our way. 
the customs of our [[country]] we pursue, 
and trojan games on actian shores renew. 
our [[youth]] their naked limbs besmear with [[oil]], 
and exercise the wrastlers' [[noble]] toil; 
pleas'd to have sail'd so long before the wind, 
and left so many grecian towns behind. 
the sun had now fulfill'd his annual course, 
and boreas on the seas display'd his [[force]]: 
i fix'd upon the temple's lofty door 
the brazen shield which vanquish'd abas bore; 
the verse beneath my name and action speaks: 
'these arms [[aeneas]] took from conqu'ring greeks [[greek]].' 
then i command to weigh; the seamen ply 
their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly. 
the sight of high phaeacia soon we lost, 
and skimm'd along epirus' rocky coast. 
"then to chaonia's port our course we bend, 
and, landed, to buthrotus' heights ascend. 
here wondrous things were loudly blaz'd fame: 
how helenus reviv'd the trojan name, 
and reign'd in greece; that priam's captive [[son]] 
succeeded pyrrhus in his bed and [[throne]]; 
and [[fair]] andromache, restor'd by [[fate]], 
once more was [[happy]] in a trojan mate. 
i leave my galleys riding in the port, 
and long to see the new dardanian court. 
by [[chance]], the mournful queen, before the gate, 
then solemniz'd her former husband's [[fate]]. 
green altars, rais'd of turf, with gifts she crown'd, 
and [[sacred]] priests [[priest]] in order stand around, 
and thrice the name of hapless [[hector]] sound. 
the grove itself resembles ida's wood; 
and simois seem'd the well-dissembled flood. 
but when at nearer distance she beheld 
my shining armor and my trojan shield, 
astonish'd at the sight, the vital heat 
forsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat: 
she faints, she falls, and scarce recov'ring [[strength]], 
thus, with a falt'ring tongue, she speaks at length: 
"'are you alive, o goddess-born ?' she said, 
'or if a ghost, then where is hector's shade?' 
at this, she cast a loud and frightful cry. 
with broken words i made this brief reply: 
'all of me that remains appears in sight; 
i [[live]], if living be to loathe the [[light]]. 
no phantom; but i drag a wretched [[life]], 
my [[fate]] resembling that of hector's [[wife]]. 
what have you suffer'd since you lost your [[lord]]? 
by what [[strange]] blessing are you now restor'd? 
still are you hector's? or is [[hector]] fled, 
and his remembrance lost in pyrrhus' bed?' 
with [[eyes]] dejected, in a lowly tone, 
after a modest pause she thus begun: 
"'o only [[happy]] maid of priam's [[race]], 
whom [[death]] deliver'd from the foes' embrace! 
commanded on achilles' tomb to [[die]], 
not forc'd, like us, to hard captivity, 
or in a haughty master's arms to [[lie]]. 
in grecian ships unhappy we were borne, 
endur'd the victor's [[lust]], sustain'd the scorn: 
thus i submitted to the lawless [[pride]] 
of pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride. 
cloy'd with possession, he forsook my bed, 
and helen's lovely [[daughter]] sought to wed; 
then me to trojan helenus resign'd, 
and his two slaves [[slave]] in [[equal]] [[marriage]] join'd; 
till [[young]] orestes, pierc'd with deep despair, 
and longing to redeem the promis'd [[fair]], 
before apollo's altar slew the ravisher. 
by pyrrhus' [[death]] the [[kingdom]] we regain'd: 
at least one half with helenus remain'd. 
our part, from chaon, he chaonia calls, 
and names from pergamus his rising walls. 
but you, what fates [[fate]] have landed on our coast? 
what gods have sent you, or what storms have toss'd? 
does [[young]] ascanius [[life]] and health enjoy, 
sav'd from the ruins of unhappy troy? 
o tell me how his mother's loss he bears, 
what hopes [[hope]] are promis'd from his blooming years, 
how much of [[hector]] in his face appears?' 
she spoke; and mix'd her [[speech]] with mournful cries, 
and fruitless tears came trickling from her [[eyes]]. 
"at length her [[lord]] descends upon the plain, 
in pomp, attended with a num'rous train; 
receives his [[friends]], and to the [[city]] leads, 
and tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds. 
proceeding on, another troy i see, 
or, in less compass, troy's epitome. 
a riv'let by the name of xanthus ran, 
and i embrace the scaean gate again. 
my [[friends]] in porticoes were entertain'd, 
and feasts and pleasures [[pleasure]] thro' the [[city]] reign'd. 
the tables fill'd the spacious hall around, 
and golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown'd. 
two days we pass'd in mirth, till friendly gales, 
blown from the supplied our swelling sails. 
then to the [[royal]] seer i thus began: 
'o thou, who know'st, beyond the reach of [[man]], 
the laws [[law]] of heav'n, and what the stars decree; 
whom phoebus taught unerring prophecy, 
from his own tripod, and his holy tree; 
skill'd in the wing'd inhabitants of air, 
what auspices their notes and flights declare: 
o say- for all [[religious]] rites portend 
a [[happy]] [[voyage]], and a prosp'rous end; 
and ev'ry [[power]] and omen of the [[sky]] 
direct my course for destin'd [[italy]]; 
but only dire celaeno, from the gods, 
a dismal famine fatally forebodes- 
o say what dangers i am first to shun, 
what toils vanquish, and what course to run.' 
"the [[prophet]] first with [[sacrifice]] adores 
the greater gods; their pardon then implores; 
unbinds the fillet from his holy head; 
to phoebus, next, my trembling steps he [[led]], 
full of [[religious]] doubts [[doubt]] and awful dread. 
then, with his [[god]] possess'd, before the shrine, 
these words proceeded from his mouth [[divine]]: 
'o goddess-born, (for heav'n's appointed will, 
with greater auspices of [[good]] than ill, 
foreshows thy [[voyage]], and thy course directs; 
thy fates [[fate]] conspire, and jove himself protects,) 
of many things some few i shall explain, 
teach thee to shun the dangers of the main, 
and how at length the promis'd shore to gain. 
the rest the fates [[fate]] from helenus conceal, 
and juno's angry pow'r forbids to tell. 
first, then, that [[happy]] shore, that seems so nigh, 
will far from your deluded wishes [[wish]] fly; 
long tracts of seas divide your hopes [[hope]] from [[italy]]: 
for you must cruise along sicilian shores, 
and stem the currents with your struggling oars; 
then round th' italian coast your navy steer; 
and, after this, to circe's island veer; 
and, [[last]], before your new foundations rise, 
must pass the stygian lake, and view the nether skies [[sky]]. 
now mark the signs of future ease and rest, 
and bear them safely treasur'd in thy breast. 
when, in the shady shelter of a wood, 
and near the margin of a gentle flood, 
thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground, 
with thirty sucking [[young]] encompass'd round; 
the dam and offspring [[white]] as falling snow- 
these on thy [[city]] shall their name bestow, 
and there shall end thy labors and thy woe. 
nor let the threaten'd famine fright thy [[mind]], 
for phoebus will assist, and [[fate]] the way will find. 
let not thy course to that ill coast be bent, 
which fronts from far th' epirian continent: 
those parts are all by grecian foes possess'd; 
the salvage locrians here the shores infest; 
there fierce idomeneus his [[city]] builds, 
and guards with arms the salentinian fields; 
and on the mountain's brow petilia stands, 
which philoctetes with his [[troops]] commands. 
ev'n when thy fleet is landed on the shore, 
and priests [[priest]] with holy vows the gods adore, 
then with a purple veil involve your [[eyes]], 
lest hostile faces blast the [[sacrifice]]. 
these rites and customs to the rest commend, 
that to your pious [[race]] they may descend. 

"'when, parted hence, the wind, that ready waits 
for sicily, shall bear you to the straits 
where proud pelorus opes a wider way, 
tack to the larboard, and stand off to sea: 
veer starboard sea and [[land]]. th' italian shore 
and [[fair]] sicilia's coast were one, before 
an earthquake caus'd the flaw: the roaring tides 
the passage broke that [[land]] from [[land]] divides; 
and where the lands [[land]] retir'd, the rushing ocean rides. 
distinguish'd by the straits, on either hand, 
now rising cities [[city]] in long order stand, 
and fruitful fields: so much can [[time]] invade 
the mold'ring [[work]] that beauteous [[nature]] made. 
far on the [[right]], her dogs foul scylla hides: 
charybdis roaring on the left presides, 
and in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides; 
then spouts them from below: with fury driv'n, 
the waves mount up and wash the face of heav'n. 
but scylla from her den, with open jaws, 
the sinking vessel in her eddy draws, 
then dashes on the rocks. a [[human]] face, 
and virgin bosom, hides her tail's disgrace: 
her parts obscene below the waves descend, 
with dogs inclos'd, and in a dolphin end. 
't is safer, then, to bear aloof to sea, 
and coast pachynus, tho' with more delay, 
than once to view misshapen scylla near, 
and the loud yell of wat'ry wolves to hear. 
"'besides, if [[faith]] to helenus be due, 
and if prophetic phoebus tell me true, 
do not this precept of your friend forget, 
which therefore more than once i must repeat: 
above the rest, [[great]] juno's name adore; 
pay vows to juno; juno's aid implore. 
let gifts be to the mighty queen design'd, 
and mollify with pray'rs her haughty [[mind]]. 
thus, at the length, your passage shall be [[free]], 
and you shall safe descend on [[italy]]. 
arriv'd at cumae, when you view the flood 
of black avernus, and the sounding wood, 
the mad prophetic sibyl you shall find, 
dark in a cave, and on a rock reclin'd. 
she sings the fates [[fate]], and, in her frantic fits, 
the notes and names, inscrib'd, to leafs commits. 
what she commits to leafs, in order laid, 
before the cavern's entrance are display'd: 
unmov'd they [[lie]]; but, if a blast of wind 
without, or vapors issue from behind, 
the leafs are borne aloft in liquid air, 
and she resumes no more her museful [[care]], 
nor gathers from the rocks her scatter'd verse, 
nor sets in order what the winds disperse. 
thus, many not succeeding, most upbraid 
the madness of the visionary maid, 
and with loud curses leave the mystic shade. 
"'think it not loss of [[time]] a while to stay, 
tho' thy companions chide thy long delay; 
tho' summon'd to the seas, tho' pleasing gales 
invite thy course, and stretch thy swelling sails: 
but beg the [[sacred]] priestess to relate 
with willing words, and not to write thy [[fate]]. 
the fierce italian [[people]] she will show, 
and all thy wars [[war]], and all thy future woe, 
and what thou may'st avoid, and what must undergo. 
she shall direct thy course, instruct thy [[mind]], 
and [[teach]] thee how the [[happy]] shores to find. 
this is what heav'n allows me to relate: 
now part in [[peace]]; pursue thy [[better]] [[fate]], 
and raise, by [[strength]] of arms, the trojan [[state]].' 
"this when the [[priest]] with friendly voice declar'd, 
he gave me license, and [[rich]] gifts prepar'd: 
bounteous of treasure, he supplied my want 
with heavy gold, and polish'd elephant; 
then dodonaean caldrons put on board, 
and ev'ry ship with sums of silver stor'd. 
a trusty coat of mail to me he sent, 
thrice chain'd with gold, for use and ornament; 
the helm of pyrrhus added to the rest, 
that flourish'd with a plume and waving crest. 
nor was my sire forgotten, nor my [[friends]]; 
and large recruits he to my navy sends: 
men, horses, captains, arms, and warlike stores; 
supplies new pilots, and new sweeping oars. 
meantime, my sire commands to hoist our sails, 
lest we should lose the first auspicious gales. 
"the [[prophet]] bless'd the parting crew, and [[last]], 
with words like these, his ancient friend embrac'd: 
'old [[happy]] [[man]], the [[care]] of gods above, 
whom heav'nly [[venus]] honor'd with her [[love]], 
and twice preserv'd thy [[life]], when troy was lost, 
behold from far the wish'd ausonian coast: 
there [[land]]; but take a larger compass round, 
for that before is all forbidden ground. 
the shore that phoebus has design'd for you, 
at farther distance lies [[lie]], conceal'd from view. 
go [[happy]] hence, and seek your new abodes, 
blest in a [[son]], and favor'd by the gods: 
for i with useless words prolong your stay, 
when southern gales have summon'd you away.' 
"nor less the queen our parting thence deplor'd, 
nor was less bounteous than her trojan [[lord]]. 
a [[noble]] [[present]] to my [[son]] she brought, 
a robe with flow'rs on golden tissue wrought, 
a phrygian vest; and loads with gifts beside 
of precious texture, and of asian [[pride]]. 
'accept,' she said, 'these monuments of [[love]], 
which in my [[youth]] with happier hands i wove: 
regard these trifles for the giver's sake; 
't is the [[last]] [[present]] hector's [[wife]] can make. 
thou call'st my lost astyanax to [[mind]]; 
in thee his features and his form i find: 
his [[eyes]] so sparkled with a lively flame; 
such were his motions; such was all his frame; 
and ah! had heav'n so pleas'd, his years had been the same.'

"with tears i took my [[last]] adieu, and said: 
'your [[fortune]], [[happy]] pair, already made, 
leaves you no farther [[wish]]. my diff'rent [[state]], 
avoiding one, incurs another [[fate]]. 
to you a quiet seat the gods allow: 
you have no shores to search, no seas to plow, 
nor fields of flying [[italy]] to chase: 
(deluding visions, and a [[vain]] embrace!) 
you see another simois, and enjoy 
the labor of your hands, another troy, 
with [[better]] auspice than her ancient tow'rs, 
and less obnoxious to the grecian pow'rs. 
if e'er the gods, whom i with vows adore, 
conduct my steps to tiber's [[happy]] shore; 
if ever i ascend the latian [[throne]], 
and build a [[city]] i may call my own; 
as both of us our birth from troy derive, 
so let our kindred lines in concord [[live]], 
and both in acts of [[equal]] [[friendship]] strive. 
our fortunes [[fortune]], [[good]] or [[bad]], shall be the same: 
the double troy shall differ but in name; 
that what we now begin may never end, 
but long to late [[posterity]] descend.' 
"near the ceraunian rocks our course we bore; 
the shortest passage to th' italian shore. 
now had the sun withdrawn his radiant [[light]], 
and hills were hid in dusky shades of night: 
we [[land]], and, on the bosom of the ground, 
a safe retreat and a bare lodging found. 
close by the shore we lay; the sailors keep 
their watches, and the rest securely sleep. 
the night, proceeding on with silent pace, 
stood in her noon, and view'd with [[equal]] face 
her steepy rise and her declining [[race]]. 
then wakeful palinurus rose, to spy 
the face of heav'n, and the nocturnal [[sky]]; 
and listen'd ev'ry breath of air to try; 
observes the stars, and notes their sliding course, 
the pleiads, hyads, and their wat'ry [[force]]; 
and both the bears is careful to behold, 
and bright orion, arm'd with burnish'd gold. 
then, when he saw no threat'ning tempest nigh, 
but a sure promise of a settled [[sky]], 
he gave the sign to weigh; we break our sleep, 
forsake the pleasing shore, and plow the deep. 
"and now the rising morn with rosy [[light]] 
adorns the skies [[sky]], and puts the stars to flight; 
when we from far, like bluish mists, descry 
the hills, and then the plains, of [[italy]]. 
achates first pronounc'd the joyful sound; 
then, 'italy!' the cheerful crew rebound. 
my sire anchises crown'd a cup with wine, 
and, off'ring, thus implor'd the pow'rs [[divine]]: 
'ye gods, presiding over lands [[land]] and seas, 
and you who raging winds and waves appease, 
breathe on our swelling sails a prosp'rous wind, 
and smooth our passage to the port assign'd!' 
the gentle gales their flagging [[force]] renew, 
and now the [[happy]] harbor is in view. 
minerva's temple then salutes our sight, 
plac'd, as a landmark, on the mountain's height. 
we furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore; 
the curling waters round the galleys roar. 
the [[land]] lies [[lie]] open to the raging east, 
then, bending like a bow, with rocks compress'd, 
shuts out the storms; the winds and waves [[complain]], 
and vent their malice on the cliffs in [[vain]]. 
the port lies [[lie]] hid within; on either side 
two tow'ring rocks the narrow mouth divide. 
the temple, which aloft we view'd before, 
to distance flies, and seems to shun the shore. 
scarce landed, the first omens i beheld 
were four [[white]] steeds that cropp'd the flow'ry field. 
'war, [[war]] is threaten'd from this [[foreign]] ground,' 
my [[father]] cried, 'where warlike steeds are found. 
yet, since reclaim'd to chariots they submit, 
and bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit, 
peace may succeed to [[war]].' our way we bend 
to pallas, and the [[sacred]] hill ascend; 
there prostrate to the fierce virago [[pray]], 
whose temple was the landmark of our way. 
each with a phrygian mantle veil'd his head, 
and all commands of helenus obey'd, 
and pious rites to grecian juno paid. 
these dues perform'd, we stretch our sails, and stand 
to sea, forsaking that suspected [[land]]. 
"from hence tarentum's bay appears in view, 
for hercules renown'd, if fame be true. 
just opposite, lacinian juno stands; 
caulonian tow'rs, and scylacaean strands, 
for shipwrecks fear'd. mount aetna thence we spy, 
known by the smoky flames which cloud the [[sky]]. 
far off we hear the waves with surly sound 
invade the rocks, the rocks their groans rebound. 
the billows break upon the sounding strand, 
and roll the rising tide, impure with sand. 
then thus anchises, in [[experience]] old: 
''t is that charybdis which the seer foretold, 
and those the promis'd rocks! bear off to sea!' 
with haste the frighted mariners obey. 
first palinurus to the larboard veer'd; 
then all the fleet by his [[example]] steer'd. 
to heav'n aloft on ridgy waves we ride, 
then down to hell descend, when they divide; 
and thrice our galleys knock'd the stony ground, 
and thrice the hollow rocks return'd the sound, 
and thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews around.

the flagging winds forsook us, with the sun; 
and, wearied, on cyclopian shores we run. 
the port capacious, and secure from wind, 
is to the foot of thund'ring aetna join'd. 
by turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high; 
by turns hot embers from her entrails fly, 
and flakes of mounting flames, that lick the [[sky]]. 
oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown, 
and, shiver'd by the [[force]], come piecemeal down. 
oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow, 
fed from the fiery springs that boil below. 
enceladus, they say, transfix'd by jove, 
with blasted limbs came tumbling from above; 
and, where he fell, th' avenging [[father]] drew 
this flaming hill, and on his [[body]] threw. 
as often as he turns his weary sides, 
he shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens [[heaven]] hides. 
in shady woods we pass the tedious night, 
where bellowing sounds and groans our souls [[soul]] affright, 
of which no cause is offer'd to the sight; 
for not one star was kindled in the [[sky]], 
nor could the moon her borrow'd [[light]] supply; 
for misty clouds involv'd the firmament, 
the stars were muffled, and the moon was pent. 
"scarce had the rising sun the day reveal'd, 
scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispell'd, 
when from the woods there bolts, before our sight, 
somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite, 
so thin, so ghastly meager, and so wan, 
so bare of flesh, he scarce resembled [[man]]. 
this thing, all tatter'd, seem'd from far t' implore 
our pious aid, and pointed to the shore. 
we look behind, then view his shaggy beard; 
his clothes were tagg'd with thorns, and filth his limbs besmear'd;

the rest, in mien, in habit, and in face, 
appear'd a [[greek]], and such indeed he was. 
he cast on us, from far, a frightful view, 
whom soon for trojans and for foes he knew; 
stood still, and paus'd; then all at once began 
to stretch his limbs, and trembled as he ran. 
soon as approach'd, upon his knees he falls, 
and thus with tears and sighs for [[pity]] calls: 
'now, by the pow'rs above, and what we share 
from nature's [[common]] gift, this vital air, 
o trojans, take me hence! i beg no more; 
but bear me far from this unhappy shore. 
't is true, i am a [[greek]], and farther own, 
among your foes besieg'd th' imperial town. 
for such demerits if my [[death]] be due, 
no more for this abandon'd [[life]] i sue; 
this only favor let my tears obtain, 
to throw me headlong in the rapid main: 
since nothing more than [[death]] my crime demands, 
i [[die]] content, to [[die]] by [[human]] hands.' 
he said, and on his knees my knees embrac'd: 
i bade him boldly tell his [[fortune]] [[past]], 
his [[present]] [[state]], his lineage, and his name, 
th' [[occasion]] of his fears [[fear]], and whence he came. 
the [[good]] anchises rais'd him with his hand; 
who, thus encourag'd, answer'd our demand: 
'from ithaca, my native soil, i came 
to troy; and achaemenides my name. 
me my [[poor]] [[father]] with [[ulysses]] sent; 
(o had i stay'd, with [[poverty]] content!) 
but, fearful for themselves, my countrymen 
left me forsaken in the cyclops' den. 
the cave, tho' large, was dark; the dismal floor 
was pav'd with mangled limbs and putrid gore. 
our monstrous host, of more than [[human]] size, 
erects his head, and stares within the skies [[sky]]; 
bellowing his voice, and horrid is his hue. 
ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view! 
the joints of slaughter'd wretches are his food; 
and for his wine he quaffs the streaming [[blood]]. 
these [[eyes]] beheld, when with his spacious hand 
he seiz'd two captives of our grecian band; 
stretch'd on his back, he dash'd against the stones 
their broken bodies [[body]], and their crackling bones: 
with spouting [[blood]] the purple pavement swims, 
while the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs. 
"'not unreveng'd [[ulysses]] bore their [[fate]], 
nor thoughtless of his own unhappy [[state]]; 
for, gorg'd with flesh, and drunk with [[human]] wine 
while fast asleep the giant lay supine, 
snoring aloud, and belching from his maw 
his indigested foam, and morsels raw; 
we [[pray]]; we cast the lots, and then surround 
the monstrous [[body]], stretch'd along the ground: 
each, as he could approach him, lends a hand 
to bore his eyeball with a flaming brand. 
beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye; 
for only one did the vast frame supply- 
but that a globe so large, his front it fill'd, 
like the sun's disk or like a grecian shield. 
the stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends: 
this vengeance follow'd for our slaughter'd [[friends]]. 
but haste, unhappy wretches, haste to fly! 
your cables cut, and on your oars rely! 
such, and so vast as polypheme appears, 
a hundred more this hated island bears: 
like him, in caves they shut their woolly sheep; 
like him, their herds on tops of mountains keep; 
like him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to steep

and now three moons their sharpen'd horns renew, 
since thus, in woods and wilds, obscure from view, 
i drag my loathsome days with mortal fright, 
and in deserted caverns lodge by night; 
oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see 
of the huge cyclops, like a walking tree: 
from far i hear his thund'ring voice resound, 
and trampling feet that shake the solid ground. 
cornels and salvage berries of the wood, 
and roots and herbs, have been my meager food. 
while all around my longing [[eyes]] i cast, 
i saw your [[happy]] ships appear at [[last]]. 
on those i fix'd my hopes [[hope]], to these i run; 
't is all i ask, this cruel [[race]] to shun; 
what other [[death]] you please, yourselves bestow.' 
"scarce had he said, when on the mountain's brow 
we saw the giant shepherd stalk before 
his following flock, and leading to the shore: 
a monstrous bulk, deform'd, depriv'd of sight; 
his staff a trunk of pine, to guide his steps aright. 
his pond'rous whistle from his neck descends; 
his woolly [[care]] their pensive [[lord]] attends: 
this only solace his hard [[fortune]] sends. 
soon as he reach'd the shore and touch'd the waves, 
from his bor'd eye the gutt'ring [[blood]] he laves: 
he gnash'd his teeth, and groan'd; thro' seas he strides,

and scarce the topmost billows touch'd his sides. 
"seiz'd with a sudden [[fear]], we run to sea, 
the cables cut, and silent haste away; 
the well-deserving stranger entertain; 
then, buckling to the [[work]], our oars divide the main. 
the giant harken'd to the dashing sound: 
but, when our vessels out of reach he found, 
he strided onward, and in [[vain]] essay'd 
th' ionian deep, and durst no farther wade. 
with that he roar'd aloud: the dreadful cry 
shakes [[earth]], and air, and seas; the billows fly 
before the bellowing noise to distant [[italy]]. 
the neigh'ring aetna trembling all around, 
the winding caverns echo to the sound. 
his [[brother]] cyclops hear the yelling roar, 
and, rushing down the mountains, crowd the shore. 
we saw their stern distorted looks, from far, 
and one-eyed glance, that vainly threaten'd [[war]]: 
a dreadful council, with their heads on high; 
(the misty clouds about their foreheads fly;) 
not yielding to the tow'ring tree of jove, 
or tallest cypress of diana's grove. 
new pangs of mortal [[fear]] our minds [[mind]] assail; 
we tug at ev'ry oar, and hoist up ev'ry sail, 
and take th' advantage of the friendly gale. 
forewarn'd by helenus, we strive to shun 
charybdis' gulf, nor dare to scylla run. 
an [[equal]] [[fate]] on either side appears: 
we, tacking to the left, are [[free]] from fears [[fear]]; 
for, from pelorus' point, the north arose, 
and drove us back where swift pantagias flows. 
his rocky mouth we pass, and make our way 
by thapsus and megara's winding bay. 
this passage achaemenides had shown, 
tracing the course which he before had run. 
"right o'er against plemmyrium's wat'ry strand, 
there lies [[lie]] an isle once call'd th' ortygian [[land]]. 
alpheus, as old fame reports, has found 
from greece a secret passage under ground, 
by [[love]] to beauteous arethusa [[led]]; 
and, mingling here, they roll in the same [[sacred]] bed. 
as helenus enjoin'd, we next adore 
diana's name, protectress of the shore. 
with prosp'rous gales we pass the quiet sounds 
of still elorus, and his fruitful bounds. 
then, doubling cape pachynus, we survey 
the rocky shore extended to the sea. 
the town of camarine from far we see, 
and fenny lake, undrain'd by fate's decree. 
in sight of the geloan fields we pass, 
and the large walls, where mighty gela was; 
then agragas, with lofty summits crown'd, 
long for the [[race]] of warlike steeds renown'd. 
we pass'd selinus, and the palmy [[land]], 
and widely shun the lilybaean strand, 
unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand. 
at length on shore the weary fleet arriv'd, 
which drepanum's unhappy port receiv'd. 
here, after endless labors, often toss'd 
by raging storms, and driv'n on ev'ry coast, 
my dear, dear [[father]], spent with [[age]], i lost: 
ease of my cares [[care]], and solace of my [[pain]], 
sav'd thro' a thousand toils, but sav'd in [[vain]] 
the [[prophet]], who my future woes reveal'd, 
yet this, the [[greatest]] and the worst, conceal'd; 
and dire celaeno, whose foreboding [[skill]] 
denounc'd all else, was silent of the ill. 
this my [[last]] labor was. some friendly [[god]] 
from thence convey'd us to your blest abode." 
thus, to the list'ning queen, the [[royal]] guest 
his wand'ring course and all his toils express'd; 
and here concluding, he retir'd to rest. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book iv

but anxious cares [[care]] already seiz'd the queen: 
she fed within her veins a flame unseen; 
the hero's valor, acts, and birth inspire 
her [[soul]] with [[love]], and fan the secret [[fire]]. 
his words, his looks, imprinted in her [[heart]], 
improve the passion, and increase the smart. 
now, when the purple morn had chas'd away 
the dewy shadows, and restor'd the day, 
her sister first with early [[care]] she sought, 
and thus in mournful accents eas'd her [[thought]]: 
"my dearest anna, what new dreams [[dream]] affright 
my lab'ring soul! what visions of the night 
disturb my quiet, and distract my breast 
with [[strange]] ideas [[idea]] of our trojan guest! 
his worth, his actions, and majestic air, 
a [[man]] descended from the gods declare. 
fear ever argues a degenerate [[kind]]; 
his birth is well asserted by his [[mind]]. 
then, what he suffer'd, when by [[fate]] betray'd! 
what brave attempts for falling troy he made! 
such were his looks, so gracefully he spoke, 
that, were i not resolv'd against the yoke 
of hapless [[marriage]], never to be curst 
with second [[love]], so fatal was my first, 
to this one error i might yield again; 
for, since sichaeus was untimely slain, 
this only [[man]] is able to subvert 
the fix'd foundations of my stubborn [[heart]]. 
and, to confess my frailty, to my shame, 
somewhat i find within, if not the same, 
too like the sparkles of my former flame. 
but first let yawning [[earth]] a passage rend, 
and let me thro' the dark abyss descend; 
first let avenging jove, with flames from high, 
drive down this [[body]] to the nether [[sky]], 
condemn'd with ghosts in endless night to [[lie]], 
before i break the plighted [[faith]] i gave! 
no! he who had my vows shall ever have; 
for, whom i lov'd on [[earth]], i [[worship]] in the grave." 
she said: the tears ran gushing from her [[eyes]], 
and stopp'd her [[speech]]. her sister thus replies: 
"o dearer than the vital air i breathe, 
will you to [[grief]] your blooming years bequeath, 
condemn'd to waste in woes your lonely [[life]], 
without the joys of [[mother]] or of [[wife]]? 
think you these tears, this pompous train of woe, 
are known or valued by the ghosts below? 
i grant that, while your sorrows [[sorrow]] yet were green, 
it well became a woman, and a queen, 
the vows of tyrian princes [[prince]] to neglect, 
to scorn hyarbas, and his [[love]] reject, 
with all the libyan lords [[lord]] of mighty name; 
but will you [[fight]] against a pleasing flame! 
this little spot of [[land]], which heav'n bestows, 
on ev'ry side is hemm'd with warlike foes; 
gaetulian cities [[city]] here are spread around, 
and fierce numidians there your frontiers bound; 
here lies [[lie]] a barren waste of thirsty [[land]], 
and there the syrtes raise the moving sand; 
barcaean [[troops]] besiege the narrow shore, 
and from the sea pygmalion threatens more. 
propitious heav'n, and gracious juno, lead 
this wand'ring navy to your needful aid: 
how will your [[empire]] spread, your [[city]] rise, 
from such a union, and with such allies? 
implore the favor of the pow'rs above, 
and leave the conduct of the rest to [[love]]. 
continue still your hospitable way, 
and still invent occasions [[occasion]] of their stay, 
till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat, 
and planks and oars repair their shatter'd fleet." 
these words, which from a friend and sister came, 
with ease resolv'd the scruples of her fame, 
and added fury to the kindled flame. 
inspir'd with [[hope]], the project they pursue; 
on ev'ry altar [[sacrifice]] renew: 
a chosen ewe of two years old they [[pay]] 
to ceres, bacchus, and the [[god]] of day; 
preferring juno's pow'r, for juno ties 
the nuptial knot and makes the [[marriage]] joys. 
the beauteous queen before her altar stands, 
and holds the golden goblet in her hands. 
a milk-white heifer she with flow'rs adorns, 
and pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns; 
and, while the priests [[priest]] with pray'r the gods invoke, 
she feeds their altars with sabaean smoke, 
with hourly [[care]] the [[sacrifice]] renews, 
and anxiously the panting entrails views. 
what priestly rites, alas! what pious art [[arts]], 
what vows avail to cure a bleeding heart! 
a gentle [[fire]] she feeds within her veins, 
where the soft [[god]] secure in [[silence]] reigns. 
sick with [[desire]], and seeking him she loves [[love]], 
from street to street the raving dido roves. 
so when the watchful shepherd, from the blind, 
wounds with a random shaft the careless hind, 
distracted with her [[pain]] she flies the woods, 
bounds o'er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods, 
with fruitless [[care]]; for still the fatal dart 
sticks in her side, and rankles in her [[heart]]. 
and now she leads the trojan [[chief]] along 
the lofty walls, amidst the busy throng; 
displays her tyrian [[wealth]], and rising town, 
which [[love]], without his labor, makes his own. 
this pomp she shows, to tempt her wand'ring guest; 
her falt'ring tongue forbids to speak the rest. 
when day declines, and feasts renew the night, 
still on his face she feeds her famish'd sight; 
she longs again to hear the [[prince]] relate 
his own adventures and the trojan [[fate]]. 
he tells it o'er and o'er; but still in [[vain]], 
for still she begs to hear it once again. 
the hearer on the speaker's mouth depends, 
and thus the tragic story never ends. 
then, when they part, when phoebe's paler [[light]] 
withdraws, and falling stars to sleep invite, 
she [[last]] remains, when ev'ry guest is gone, 
sits on the bed he press'd, and sighs alone; 
absent, her absent hero sees and hears; 
or in her bosom [[young]] ascanius bears, 
and seeks the father's image in the child, 
if [[love]] by likeness might be so beguil'd. 
meantime the rising tow'rs are at a stand; 
no labors exercise the youthful band, 
nor use of [[arts]], nor toils of arms they [[know]]; 
the mole is left unfinish'd to the foe; 
the mounds, the works [[work]], the walls, neglected [[lie]], 
short of their promis'd heighth, that seem'd to threat the [[sky]],

but when imperial juno, from above, 
saw dido fetter'd in the chains of [[love]], 
hot with the venom which her veins inflam'd, 
and by no sense of shame to be reclaim'd, 
with soothing words to [[venus]] she begun: 
"high praises [[praise]], endless honors, you have won, 
and mighty trophies, with your worthy son! 
two gods a silly woman have undone! 
nor am i ignorant, you both suspect 
this rising [[city]], which my hands erect: 
but shall celestial discord never cease? 
't is [[better]] ended in a lasting [[peace]]. 
you stand possess'd of all your [[soul]] desir'd: 
poor dido with consuming [[love]] is fir'd. 
your trojan with my tyrian let us join; 
so dido shall be yours, [[aeneas]] mine: 
one [[common]] [[kingdom]], one [[united]] line. 
eliza shall a dardan [[lord]] obey, 
and lofty [[carthage]] for a dow'r convey." 
then [[venus]], who her hidden fraud descried, 
which would the scepter of the [[world]] misguide 
to libyan shores, thus artfully replied: 
"who, but a [[fool]], would wars [[war]] with juno choose, 
and such [[alliance]] and such gifts refuse, 
if [[fortune]] with our joint desires [[desire]] comply? 
the [[doubt]] is all from jove and [[destiny]]; 
lest he forbid, with absolute command, 
to mix the [[people]] in one [[common]] land- 
or will the trojan and the tyrian line 
in lasting leagues and sure succession join? 
but you, the partner of his bed and [[throne]], 
may move his [[mind]]; my wishes [[wish]] are your own." 
"mine," said imperial juno, "be the [[care]]; 
time urges, now, to [[perfect]] this affair: 
attend my counsel, and the secret share. 
when next the sun his rising [[light]] displays, 
and gilds the [[world]] below with purple rays, 
the queen, [[aeneas]], and the tyrian court 
shall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort. 
there, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around, 
and cheerful horns from side to side resound, 
a pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain 
with hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain; 
the fearful train shall take their speedy flight, 
dispers'd, and all involv'd in gloomy night; 
one cave a grateful shelter shall afford 
to the [[fair]] princess and the trojan [[lord]]. 
i will myself the bridal bed prepare, 
if you, to bless the nuptials, will be there: 
so shall their loves [[love]] be crown'd with due delights, 
and hymen shall be [[present]] at the rites." 
the queen of [[love]] consents, and closely smiles 
at her [[vain]] project, and discover'd wiles. 
the rosy morn was risen from the main, 
and horns and hounds awake the princely train: 
they issue early thro' the [[city]] gate, 
where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait, 
with nets, and toils, and darts, beside the [[force]] 
of spartan dogs, and swift massylian horse. 
the tyrian peers and officers of [[state]] 
for the slow queen in antechambers wait; 
her lofty courser, in the court below, 
who his majestic rider seems to [[know]], 
proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground, 
and champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around. 
the queen at length appears; on either hand 
the brawny guards in martial order stand. 
a flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore, 
and at her back a golden quiver bore; 
her flowing hair a golden caul restrains, 
a golden clasp the tyrian robe sustains. 
then [[young]] ascanius, with a sprightly grace, 
leads on the trojan [[youth]] to view the chase. 
but far above the rest in [[beauty]] shines 
the [[great]] [[aeneas]], the troop he joins; 
like [[fair]] [[apollo]], when he leaves the frost 
of wint'ry xanthus, and the lycian coast, 
when to his native delos he resorts, 
ordains the dances, and renews the sports [[sport]]; 
where painted scythians, mix'd with cretan bands, 
before the joyful altars join their hands: 
himself, on cynthus walking, sees below 
the merry madness of the [[sacred]] show. 
green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose; 
a golden fillet binds his awful brows; 
his quiver sounds: not less the [[prince]] is seen 
in manly presence, or in lofty mien. 
now had they reach'd the hills, and storm'd the seat 
of salvage beasts, in dens, their [[last]] retreat. 
the cry pursues the mountain goats: they bound 
from rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground; 
quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train, 
in herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain, 
and a long chase in open view maintain. 
the glad ascanius, as his courser guides, 
spurs thro' the vale, and these and those outrides. 
his horse's flanks and sides are forc'd to [[feel]] 
the clanking lash, and goring of the steel. 
impatiently he views the feeble prey, 
wishing some nobler beast to cross his way, 
and rather would the tusky boar attend, 
or see the tawny lion downward bend. 
meantime, the gath'ring clouds obscure the skies [[sky]]: 
from pole to pole the forky lightning flies; 
the rattling thunders roll; and juno pours 
a wintry deluge down, and sounding show'rs. 
the company, dispers'd, to converts ride, 
and seek the homely cots, or mountain's hollow side. 
the rapid rains, descending from the hills, 
to rolling torrents raise the creeping rills. 
the queen and [[prince]], as [[love]] or [[fortune]] guides, 
one [[common]] cavern in her bosom hides. 
then first the trembling [[earth]] the signal gave, 
and flashing fires [[fire]] enlighten all the cave; 
hell from below, and juno from above, 
and howling nymphs [[nymph]], were conscious of their [[love]]. 
from this ill-omen'd hour in [[time]] arose 
debate and [[death]], and all succeeding woes. 
the queen, whom sense of [[honor]] could not move, 
no longer made a secret of her [[love]], 
but call'd it [[marriage]], by that specious name 
to veil the crime and sanctify the shame. 
the loud report thro' libyan cities [[city]] goes. 
fame, the [[great]] ill, from small beginnings grows: 
swift from the first; and ev'ry moment brings 
new vigor to her flights, new pinions to her wings. 
soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size; 
her feet on [[earth]], her forehead in the skies [[sky]]. 
inrag'd against the gods, revengeful [[earth]] 
produc'd her [[last]] of the titanian birth. 
swift is her walk, more swift her winged haste: 
a monstrous phantom, horrible and vast. 
as many plumes as raise her lofty flight, 
so many piercing [[eyes]] inlarge her sight; 
millions of opening mouths to fame belong, 
and ev'ry mouth is furnish'd with a tongue, 
and round with list'ning ears the flying plague is hung.

she fills the peaceful [[universe]] with cries; 
no slumbers ever close her wakeful [[eyes]]; 
by day, from lofty tow'rs her head she shews, 
and spreads thro' trembling crowds disastrous news; 
with court informers haunts, and [[royal]] spies; 
things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles [[truth]] with

lies. 
talk is her [[business]], and her [[chief]] delight 
to tell of prodigies and cause affright. 
she fills the people's ears with dido's name, 
who, lost to [[honor]] and the sense of shame, 
admits into her [[throne]] and nuptial bed 
a wand'ring guest, who from his [[country]] fled: 
whole days with him she passes in delights, 
and wastes in luxury long winter nights, 
forgetful of her fame and [[royal]] trust, 
dissolv'd in ease, abandon'd to her [[lust]]. 
the [[goddess]] widely spreads the loud report, 
and flies at length to [[king]] hyarba's court. 
when first possess'd with this unwelcome news 
whom did he not of [[men]] and gods accuse? 
this [[prince]], from ravish'd garamantis born, 
a hundred temples did with spoils adorn, 
in ammon's [[honor]], his celestial sire; 
a hundred altars fed with wakeful [[fire]]; 
and, thro' his vast dominions, priests [[priest]] ordain'd, 
whose watchful [[care]] these holy rites maintain'd. 
the gates and columns were with garlands crown'd, 
and [[blood]] of victim beasts enrich'd the ground. 
he, when he heard a fugitive could move 
the tyrian princess, who disdain'd his [[love]], 
his breast with fury burn'd, his [[eyes]] with [[fire]], 
mad with despair, impatient with [[desire]]; 
then on the [[sacred]] altars pouring wine, 
he thus with pray'rs implor'd his sire [[divine]]: 
"great jove! propitious to the moorish [[race]], 
who feast on painted beds, with off'rings grace 
thy temples, and adore thy pow'r [[divine]] 
with [[blood]] of victims, and with sparkling wine, 
seest thou not this? or do we [[fear]] in [[vain]] 
thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign? 
do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance? 
thine are the bolts, or the blind [[work]] of [[chance]]? 
a wand'ring woman builds, within our [[state]], 
a little town, bought at an easy rate; 
she pays [[pay]] me homage, and my grants allow 
a narrow space of libyan lands [[land]] to plow; 
yet, scorning me, by passion blindly [[led]], 
admits a banish'd trojan to her bed! 
and now this other [[paris]], with his train 
of conquer'd cowards, must in afric reign! 
(whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess, 
their locks with [[oil]] perfum'd, their lydian dress.) 
he takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame; 
and i, rejected i, adore an empty name." 
his vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr'd, 
and held his altar's horns. the mighty thund'rer heard; 
then cast his [[eyes]] on [[carthage]], where he found 
the lustful pair in lawless [[pleasure]] drown'd, 
lost in their loves [[love]], insensible of shame, 
and both forgetful of their [[better]] fame. 
he calls cyllenius, and the [[god]] attends, 
by whom his menacing command he sends: 
"go, mount the western winds, and cleave the [[sky]]; 
then, with a swift descent, to [[carthage]] fly: 
there find the trojan [[chief]], who wastes his days 
in slothful not and inglorious ease, 
nor minds [[mind]] the future [[city]], giv'n by [[fate]]. 
to him this message from my mouth relate: 
'not so [[fair]] [[venus]] hop'd, when twice she won 
thy [[life]] with pray'rs, nor promis'd such a [[son]]. 
hers was a hero, destin'd to command 
a martial [[race]], and [[rule]] the latian [[land]], 
who should his ancient line from teucer draw, 
and on the conquer'd [[world]] impose the [[law]].' 
if [[glory]] cannot move a [[mind]] so mean, 
nor future [[praise]] from fading [[pleasure]] wean, 
yet why should he defraud his [[son]] of fame, 
and grudge the romans their [[immortal]] name! 
what are his [[vain]] designs! what hopes [[hope]] he more 
from his long ling'ring on a hostile shore, 
regardless to redeem his [[honor]] lost, 
and for his [[race]] to gain th' ausonian coast! 
bid him with speed the tyrian court forsake; 
with this command the slumb'ring warrior wake." 
hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds 
his flying feet, and mounts the western winds: 
and, whether o'er the seas or [[earth]] he flies, 
with rapid [[force]] they bear him down the skies [[sky]]. 
but first he grasps within his awful hand 
the mark of sov'reign pow'r, his magic wand; 
with this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves; 
with this he drives them down the stygian waves; 
with this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight, 
and [[eyes]], tho' clos'd in [[death]], restores to [[light]]. 
thus arm'd, the [[god]] begins his airy [[race]], 
and drives the racking clouds along the liquid space; 
now sees the tops of atlas, as he flies, 
whose brawny back supports the starry skies [[sky]]; 
atlas, whose head, with piny forests crown'd, 
is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapors bound. 
snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin 
the founts of rolling streams their [[race]] begin; 
a beard of ice on his large breast depends. 
here, pois'd upon his wings, the [[god]] descends: 
then, rested thus, he from the tow'ring height 
plung'd downward, with precipitated flight, 
lights on the seas, and skims along the flood. 
as waterfowl, who seek their fishy food, 
less, and yet less, to distant prospect show; 
by turns they dance aloft, and dive below: 
like these, the steerage of his wings he plies, 
and near the surface of the water flies, 
till, having pass'd the seas, and cross'd the sands, 
he clos'd his wings, and stoop'd on libyan lands [[land]]: 
where shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds, 
now tow'rs within the clouds advance their heads. 
arriving there, he found the trojan [[prince]] 
new ramparts raising for the town's defense. 
a purple scarf, with gold embroider'd o'er, 
(queen dido's gift,) about his waist he wore; 
a [[sword]], with glitt'ring gems diversified, 
for ornament, not use, hung idly by his side. 
then thus, with winged words, the [[god]] began, 
resuming his own shape: "degenerate [[man]], 
thou woman's [[property]], what mak'st thou here, 
these [[foreign]] walls and tyrian tow'rs to rear, 
forgetful of thy own? all-pow'rful jove, 
who sways the [[world]] below and heav'n above, 
has sent me down with this severe command: 
what means thy ling'ring in the libyan [[land]]? 
if [[glory]] cannot move a [[mind]] so mean, 
nor future [[praise]] from flitting [[pleasure]] wean, 
regard the fortunes [[fortune]] of thy rising heir: 
the promis'd [[crown]] let [[young]] ascanius wear, 
to whom th' ausonian scepter, and the [[state]] 
of rome's imperial name is ow'd by [[fate]]." 
so spoke the [[god]]; and, speaking, took his flight, 
involv'd in clouds, and vanish'd out of sight. 
the pious [[prince]] was seiz'd with sudden [[fear]]; 
mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair. 
revolving in his [[mind]] the stern command, 
he longs to fly, and loathes the charming [[land]]. 
what should he say? or how should he begin? 
what course, alas! remains to steer between 
th' offended lover and the pow'rful queen? 
this way and that he turns his anxious [[mind]], 
and all expedients tries, and none can find. 
fix'd on the deed, but doubtful of the means, 
after long [[thought]], to this [[advice]] he leans: 
three chiefs [[chief]] he calls, commands them to repair 
the fleet, and ship their [[men]] with silent [[care]]; 
some plausible pretense he bids them find, 
to color what in secret he design'd. 
himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose, 
before the love-sick [[lady]] heard the news; 
and move her tender [[mind]], by slow degrees [[degree]], 
to suffer what the sov'reign pow'r decrees: 
jove will inspire him, when, and what to say. 
they hear with [[pleasure]], and with haste obey. 
but soon the queen perceives the thin [[disguise]]: 
(what [[arts]] can blind a [[jealous]] woman's eyes!) 
she was the first to find the secret fraud, 
before the fatal news was blaz'd abroad. 
love the first motions of the lover hears, 
quick to presage, and ev'n in safety fears [[fear]]. 
nor impious fame was wanting to report 
the ships repair'd, the trojans' thick resort, 
and [[purpose]] to forsake the tyrian court. 
frantic with [[fear]], impatient of the wound, 
and impotent of [[mind]], she roves the [[city]] round. 
less wild the bacchanalian dames appear, 
when, from afar, their nightly [[god]] they hear, 
and howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear. 
at length she finds the dear perfidious [[man]]; 
prevents his form'd excuse, and thus began: 
"base and ungrateful! could you [[hope]] to fly, 
and undiscover'd scape a lover's eye? 
nor could my [[kindness]] your compassion move. 
nor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of [[love]]? 
or is the [[death]] of a despairing queen 
not worth preventing, tho' too well foreseen? 
ev'n when the wintry winds command your stay, 
you dare the tempests, and defy the sea. 
false as you are, suppose you were not bound 
to lands [[land]] unknown, and [[foreign]] coasts to sound; 
were troy restor'd, and priam's [[happy]] reign, 
now durst you tempt, for troy, the raging main? 
see whom you fly! am i the foe you shun? 
now, by those holy vows, so late begun, 
by this [[right]] hand, (since i have nothing more 
to challenge, but the [[faith]] you gave before;) 
i beg you by these tears too truly shed, 
by the new pleasures [[pleasure]] of our nuptial bed; 
if ever dido, when you most were [[kind]], 
were pleasing in your [[eyes]], or touch'd your [[mind]]; 
by these my pray'rs, if pray'rs may yet have place, 
pity the fortunes [[fortune]] of a falling [[race]]. 
for you i have provok'd a tyrant's hate, 
incens'd the libyan and the tyrian [[state]]; 
for you alone i suffer in my fame, 
bereft of [[honor]], and expos'd to shame. 
whom have i now to trust, ungrateful guest? 
(that only name remains of all the rest!) 
what have i left? or whither can i fly? 
must i attend pygmalion's [[cruelty]], 
or till hyarba shall in triumph lead 
a queen that proudly scorn'd his proffer'd bed? 
had you deferr'd, at least, your hasty flight, 
and left behind some pledge of our delight, 
some babe to bless the mother's mournful sight, 
some [[young]] [[aeneas]], to supply your place, 
whose features might express his father's face; 
i should not then [[complain]] to [[live]] bereft 
of all my husband, or be wholly left." 
here paus'd the queen. unmov'd he holds his [[eyes]], 
by jove's command; nor suffer'd [[love]] to rise, 
tho' heaving in his [[heart]]; and thus at length replies: 
"fair queen, you never can enough repeat 
your boundless favors, or i own my debt; 
nor can my [[mind]] forget eliza's name, 
while vital breath inspires this mortal frame. 
this only let me speak in my defense: 
i never hop'd a secret flight from hence, 
much less pretended to the lawful claim 
of [[sacred]] nuptials, or a husband's name. 
for, if indulgent heav'n would leave me [[free]], 
and not submit my [[life]] to fate's decree, 
my [[choice]] would lead me to the trojan shore, 
those relics to review, their dust adore, 
and priam's ruin'd palace to restore. 
but now the delphian oracle commands, 
and [[fate]] invites me to the latian lands [[land]]. 
that is the promis'd place to which i steer, 
and all my vows are terminated there. 
if you, a tyrian, and a stranger born, 
with walls and tow'rs a libyan town adorn, 
why may not we- like you, a [[foreign]] race- 
like you, seek shelter in a [[foreign]] place? 
as often as the night obscures the skies [[sky]] 
with humid shades, or twinkling stars arise, 
anchises' angry ghost in dreams [[dream]] appears, 
chides my delay, and fills my [[soul]] with fears [[fear]]; 
and [[young]] ascanius justly may [[complain]] 
of his defrauded and destin'd reign. 
ev'n now the herald of the gods appear'd: 
waking i saw him, and his message heard. 
from jove he came commission'd, heav'nly bright 
with radiant beams, and manifest to sight 
(the sender and the sent i both attest) 
these walls he enter'd, and those words express'd. 
fair queen, oppose not what the gods command; 
forc'd by my [[fate]], i leave your [[happy]] [[land]]." 
thus while he spoke, already she began, 
with sparkling [[eyes]], to view the guilty [[man]]; 
from head to foot survey'd his [[person]] o'er, 
nor longer these outrageous threats forebore: 
"false as thou art [[arts]], and, more than false, forsworn! 
not sprung from [[noble]] [[blood]], nor goddess-born, 
but hewn from harden'd entrails of a rock! 
and rough hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck! 
why should i fawn? what have i worse to [[fear]]? 
did he once look, or lent a list'ning ear, 
sigh'd when i sobb'd, or shed one kindly tear?- 
all symptoms of a base ungrateful [[mind]], 
so foul, that, which is worse, 'tis hard to find. 
of man's [[man]] [[injustice]] why should i [[complain]]? 
the gods, and jove himself, behold in [[vain]] 
triumphant [[treason]]; yet no thunder flies, 
nor juno views my wrongs [[wrong]] with [[equal]] [[eyes]]; 
faithless is [[earth]], and faithless are the skies! 
justice is fled, and [[truth]] is now no more! 
i sav'd the shipwrack'd [[exile]] on my shore; 
with needful food his hungry trojans fed; 
i took the traitor to my [[throne]] and bed: 
fool that i was- 't is little to repeat 
the rest- i stor'd and rigg'd his ruin'd fleet. 
i rave, i rave! a god's command he pleads, 
and makes heav'n accessary to his deeds. 
now lycian lots, and now the delian [[god]], 
now hermes is employ'd from jove's abode, 
to warn him hence; as if the peaceful [[state]] 
of heav'nly pow'rs were touch'd with [[human]] fate! 
but go! thy flight no longer i detain- 
go seek thy promis'd [[kingdom]] thro' the main! 
yet, if the heav'ns will hear my pious vow, 
the faithless waves, not half so false as thou, 
or secret sands, shall sepulchers afford 
to thy proud vessels, and their perjur'd [[lord]]. 
then shalt thou call on injur'd dido's name: 
dido shall come in a black sulph'ry flame, 
when [[death]] has once dissolv'd her mortal frame; 
shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep: 
her angry ghost, arising from the deep, 
shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep. 
at least my shade thy [[punishment]] shall [[know]], 
and fame shall spread the pleasing news below." 
abruptly here she stops; then turns away 
her loathing [[eyes]], and shuns the sight of day. 
amaz'd he stood, revolving in his [[mind]] 
what [[speech]] to frame, and what excuse to find. 
her fearful maids their fainting mistress [[led]], 
and softly laid her on her ivory bed. 
but [[good]] [[aeneas]], tho' he much desir'd 
to give that [[pity]] which her [[grief]] requir'd; 
tho' much he mourn'd, and labor'd with his [[love]], 
resolv'd at length, obeys the will of jove; 
reviews his forces [[force]]: they with early [[care]] 
unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare. 
the fleet is soon afloat, in all its [[pride]], 
and well-calk'd galleys in the harbor ride. 
then oaks for oars they fell'd; or, as they stood, 
of its green arms despoil'd the growing wood, 
studious of flight. the beach is cover'd o'er 
with trojan bands, that blacken all the shore: 
on ev'ry side are seen, descending down, 
thick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town. 
thus, in battalia, march embodied ants, 
fearful of winter, and of future wants, 
t' invade the corn, and to their cells convey 
the plunder'd forage of their yellow prey. 
the sable [[troops]], along the narrow tracks, 
scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs: 
some set their shoulders to the pond'rous grain; 
some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train; 
all ply their sev'ral tasks, and [[equal]] toil sustain. 
what pangs the tender breast of dido tore, 
when, from the tow'r, she saw the cover'd shore, 
and heard the shouts of sailors from afar, 
mix'd with the murmurs of the wat'ry war! 
all-pow'rful love! what changes [[change]] canst thou cause 
in [[human]] hearts [[heart]], subjected to thy laws! 
once more her haughty [[soul]] the [[tyrant]] bends: 
to pray'rs and mean submissions she descends. 
no female [[arts]] or aids she left untried, 
nor counsels unexplor'd, before she died. 
"look, anna! look! the trojans crowd to sea; 
they spread their canvas, and their anchors weigh. 
the shouting crew their ships with garlands bind, 
invoke the sea gods, and invite the wind. 
could i have [[thought]] this threat'ning blow so near, 
my tender [[soul]] had been forewarn'd to bear. 
but do not you my [[last]] request deny; 
with yon perfidious [[man]] your int'rest try, 
and bring me news, if i must [[live]] or [[die]]. 
you are his fav'rite; you alone can find 
the dark recesses of his inmost [[mind]]: 
in all his trusted secrets you have part, 
and [[know]] the soft approaches to his [[heart]]. 
haste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe; 
tell him, i did not with the grecians go, 
nor did my fleet against his [[friends]] employ, 
nor swore the ruin of unhappy troy, 
nor mov'd with hands profane his father's dust: 
why should he then reject a just! 
whom does he shun, and whither would he fly! 
can he this [[last]], this only pray'r deny! 
let him at least his dang'rous flight delay, 
wait [[better]] winds, and [[hope]] a calmer sea. 
the nuptials he disclaims i urge no more: 
let him pursue the promis'd latian shore. 
a short delay is all i ask him now; 
a pause of [[grief]], an interval from woe, 
till my soft [[soul]] be temper'd to sustain 
accustom'd sorrows [[sorrow]], and inur'd to [[pain]]. 
if you in [[pity]] grant this one request, 
my [[death]] shall glut the [[hatred]] of his breast." 
this mournful message pious anna bears, 
and seconds with her own her sister's tears: 
but all her [[arts]] are still employ'd in [[vain]]; 
again she comes, and is refus'd again. 
his harden'd [[heart]] nor pray'rs nor threat'nings move; 
fate, and the [[god]], had stopp'd his ears to [[love]]. 
as, when the winds their airy quarrel try, 
justling from ev'ry quarter of the [[sky]], 
this way and that the mountain oak they bend, 
his boughs they shatter, and his branches rend; 
with leaves and falling mast they spread the ground; 
the hollow valleys echo to the sound: 
unmov'd, the [[royal]] plant their fury mocks, 
or, shaken, clings more closely to the rocks; 
far as he shoots his tow'ring head on high, 
so deep in [[earth]] his fix'd foundations [[lie]]. 
no less a storm the trojan hero bears; 
thick messages and loud complaints he hears, 
and bandied words, still beating on his ears. 
sighs, groans, and tears proclaim his inward pains [[pain]]; 
but the firm [[purpose]] of his [[heart]] remains. 
the wretched queen, pursued by cruel [[fate]], 
begins at length the [[light]] of heav'n to hate, 
and loathes to [[live]]. then dire portents she sees, 
to hasten on the [[death]] her [[soul]] decrees: 
strange to relate! for when, before the shrine, 
she pours in [[sacrifice]] the purple wine, 
the purple wine is turn'd to putrid [[blood]], 
and the [[white]] offer'd milk converts to mud. 
this dire presage, to her alone reveal'd, 
from all, and ev'n her sister, she conceal'd. 
a marble temple stood within the grove, 
sacred to [[death]], and to her murther'd [[love]]; 
that honor'd chapel she had hung around 
with snowy fleeces, and with garlands crown'd: 
oft, when she visited this lonely dome, 
strange voices issued from her husband's tomb; 
she [[thought]] she heard him summon her away, 
invite her to his grave, and chide her stay. 
hourly 't is heard, when with a boding note 
the solitary screech owl strains her throat, 
and, on a chimney's top, or turret's height, 
with songs [[song]] obscene disturbs the [[silence]] of the night. 
besides, old prophecies augment her fears [[fear]]; 
and stern [[aeneas]] in her dreams [[dream]] appears, 
disdainful as by day: she seems, alone, 
to wander in her sleep, thro' ways unknown, 
guideless and dark; or, in a desart plain, 
to seek her subjects [[subject]], and to seek in [[vain]]: 
like pentheus, when, distracted with his [[fear]], 
he saw two suns, and double thebes, appear; 
or mad orestes, when his mother's ghost 
full in his face infernal torches toss'd, 
and shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight, 
flies o'er the stage, surpris'd with mortal fright; 
the furies guard the door and intercept his flight. 
now, sinking underneath a load of [[grief]], 
from [[death]] alone she seeks her [[last]] relief; 
the [[time]] and means resolv'd within her breast, 
she to her mournful sister thus address'd 
(dissembling [[hope]], her cloudy front she clears, 
and a false vigor in her [[eyes]] appears): 
"rejoice!" she said. "instructed from above, 
my lover i shall gain, or lose my [[love]]. 
nigh rising atlas, next the falling sun, 
long tracts of ethiopian climates run: 
there a massylian priestess i have found, 
honor'd for [[age]], for magic [[arts]] renown'd: 
th' hesperian temple was her trusted [[care]]; 
't was she supplied the wakeful dragon's fare. 
she poppy seeds in honey taught to steep, 
reclaim'd his rage, and sooth'd him into sleep. 
she watch'd the golden fruit; her charms unbind 
the chains of [[love]], or fix them on the [[mind]]: 
she stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry, 
repels the stars, and backward bears the [[sky]]. 
the yawning [[earth]] rebellows to her call, 
pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall. 
witness, ye gods, and thou my [[better]] part, 
how loth i am to try this impious art! 
within the secret court, with silent [[care]], 
erect a lofty pile, expos'd in air: 
hang on the topmost part the trojan vest, 
spoils, arms, and presents [[present]], of my faithless guest. 
next, under these, the bridal bed be plac'd, 
where i my ruin in his arms embrac'd: 
all relics of the wretch are doom'd to [[fire]]; 
for so the priestess and her charms require." 
thus far she said, and farther [[speech]] forbears; 
a mortal paleness in her face appears: 
yet the mistrustless anna could not find 
the secret fun'ral in these rites design'd; 
nor [[thought]] so dire a rage possess'd her [[mind]]. 
unknowing of a train conceal'd so well, 
she fear'd no worse than when sichaeus fell; 
therefore obeys. the fatal pile they rear, 
within the secret court, expos'd in air. 
the cloven holms and pines are heap'd on high, 
and garlands on the hollow spaces [[lie]]. 
sad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath, 
and ev'ry baleful green denoting [[death]]. 
the queen, determin'd to the fatal deed, 
the spoils and [[sword]] he left, in order spread, 
and the man's [[man]] image on the nuptial bed. 
and now (the [[sacred]] altars plac'd around) 
the priestess enters, with her hair unbound, 
and thrice invokes the pow'rs below the ground. 
night, erebus, and [[chaos]] she proclaims, 
and threefold hecate, with her hundred names, 
and three dianas: next, she sprinkles round 
with feign'd avernian drops the hallow'd ground; 
culls hoary simples, found by phoebe's [[light]], 
with brazen sickles reap'd at noon of night; 
then mixes baleful juices in the bowl, 
and cuts the forehead of a newborn foal, 
robbing the mother's [[love]]. the destin'd queen 
observes, assisting at the rites obscene; 
a leaven'd cake in her devoted hands 
she holds, and next the highest altar stands: 
one tender foot was shod, her other bare; 
girt was her gather'd gown, and loose her hair. 
thus dress'd, she summon'd, with her dying breath, 
the heav'ns and planets conscious of her [[death]], 
and ev'ry pow'r, if any rules [[rule]] above, 
who minds [[mind]], or who revenges, injur'd [[love]]. 
"'t was [[dead]] of night, when weary bodies [[body]] close 
their [[eyes]] in balmy sleep and soft repose: 
the winds no longer whisper thro' the woods, 
nor murm'ring tides disturb the gentle floods. 
the stars in silent order mov'd around; 
and [[peace]], with downy wings, was brooding on the ground 
the flocks and herds, and party-color'd fowl, 
which haunt the woods, or swim the weedy pool, 
stretch'd on the quiet [[earth]], securely lay, 
forgetting the [[past]] labors of the day. 
all else of nature's [[common]] gift partake: 
unhappy dido was alone awake. 
nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find; 
sleep fled her [[eyes]], as quiet fled her [[mind]]. 
despair, and rage, and [[love]] divide her [[heart]]; 
despair and rage had some, but [[love]] the greater part. 
then thus she said within her secret [[mind]]: 
"what shall i do? what succor can i find? 
become a suppliant to hyarba's [[pride]], 
and take my turn, to court and be denied? 
shall i with this ungrateful trojan go, 
forsake an [[empire]], and attend a foe? 
himself i refug'd, and his train reliev'd- 
't is true- but am i sure to be receiv'd? 
can gratitude in trojan souls [[soul]] have place! 
laomedon still lives [[life]] in all his race! 
then, shall i seek alone the churlish crew, 
or with my fleet their flying sails pursue? 
what [[force]] have i but those whom scarce before 
i drew reluctant from their native shore? 
will they again embark at my [[desire]], 
once more sustain the seas, and quit their second tyre? 
rather with steel thy guilty breast invade, 
and take the [[fortune]] thou thyself hast made. 
your [[pity]], sister, first seduc'd my [[mind]], 
or seconded too well what i design'd. 
these dear-bought pleasures [[pleasure]] had i never known, 
had i continued [[free]], and still my own; 
avoiding [[love]], i had not found despair, 
but shar'd with salvage beasts the [[common]] air. 
like them, a lonely [[life]] i might have [[led]], 
not mourn'd the living, nor disturb'd the [[dead]]." 
these thoughts [[thought]] she brooded in her anxious breast. 
on board, the trojan found more easy rest. 
resolv'd to sail, in sleep he pass'd the night; 
and order'd all things for his early flight. 
to whom once more the winged [[god]] appears; 
his former youthful mien and shape he wears, 
and with this new alarm invades his ears: 
"sleep'st thou, o goddess-born! and canst thou drown 
thy needful cares [[care]], so near a hostile town, 
beset with foes; nor hear'st the western gales 
invite thy passage, and inspire thy sails? 
she harbors in her [[heart]] a furious hate, 
and thou shalt find the dire effects too late; 
fix'd on [[revenge]], and obstinate to [[die]]. 
haste swiftly hence, while thou hast pow'r to fly. 
the sea with ships will soon be cover'd o'er, 
and blazing firebrands kindle all the shore. 
prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies [[sky]], 
and sail before the purple morn arise. 
who knows [[know]] what hazards thy delay may bring? 
woman's a various and a changeful thing." 
thus hermes in the [[dream]]; then took his flight 
aloft in air unseen, and mix'd with night. 
twice warn'd by the celestial messenger, 
the pious [[prince]] arose with hasty [[fear]]; 
then rous'd his drowsy train without delay: 
"haste to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh, 
and spread your flying sails, and stand to sea. 
a [[god]] commands: he stood before my sight, 
and urg'd us once again to speedy flight. 
o [[sacred]] pow'r, what pow'r soe'er thou art [[arts]], 
to thy blest orders i resign my [[heart]]. 
lead thou the way; [[protect]] thy trojan bands, 
and [[prosper]] the design thy will commands." 
he said: and, drawing forth his flaming [[sword]], 
his thund'ring arm divides the many-twisted cord. 
an emulating zeal inspires his train: 
they run; they snatch; they rush into the main. 
with headlong haste they leave the desert shores, 
and brush the liquid seas with lab'ring oars. 
aurora now had left her saffron bed, 
and beams of early [[light]] the heav'ns o'erspread, 
when, from a tow'r, the queen, with wakeful [[eyes]], 
saw day point upward from the rosy skies [[sky]]. 
she look'd to seaward; but the sea was void, 
and scarce in ken the sailing ships descried. 
stung with despite, and furious with despair, 
she struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair. 
"and shall th' ungrateful traitor go," she said, 
"my [[land]] forsaken, and my [[love]] betray'd? 
shall we not arm? not rush from ev'ry street, 
to [[follow]], sink, and burn his perjur'd fleet? 
haste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe! 
bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row! 
what have i said? where am i? fury turns 
my brain; and my distemper'd bosom burns. 
then, when i gave my [[person]] and my [[throne]], 
this hate, this rage, had been more timely shown. 
see now the promis'd [[faith]], the vaunted name, 
the pious [[man]], who, rushing thro' the flame, 
preserv'd his gods, and to the phrygian shore 
the burthen of his feeble [[father]] bore! 
i should have torn him piecemeal; strow'd in floods 
his scatter'd limbs, or left expos'd in woods; 
destroy'd his [[friends]] and [[son]]; and, from the [[fire]], 
have set the reeking boy before the sire. 
events are doubtful, which on battles [[battle]] wait: 
yet where's the [[doubt]], to souls [[soul]] secure of [[fate]]? 
my tyrians, at their injur'd queen's command, 
had toss'd their fires [[fire]] amid the trojan band; 
at once extinguish'd all the faithless name; 
and i myself, in vengeance of my shame, 
had fall'n upon the pile, to mend the fun'ral flame. 
thou sun, who view'st at once the [[world]] below; 
thou juno, guardian of the nuptial vow; 
thou hecate hearken from thy dark abodes! 
ye furies, fiends, and violated gods, 
all pow'rs invok'd with dido's dying breath, 
attend her curses and avenge her death! 
if so the fates [[fate]] ordain, jove commands, 
th' ungrateful wretch should find the latian lands [[land]], 
yet let a [[race]] untam'd, and haughty foes, 
his peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose: 
oppress'd with numbers in th' unequal field, 
his [[men]] discourag'd, and himself expell'd, 
let him for succor sue from place to place, 
torn from his subjects [[subject]], and his son's embrace. 
first, let him see his [[friends]] in [[battle]] slain, 
and their untimely [[fate]] lament in [[vain]]; 
and when, at length, the cruel [[war]] shall cease, 
on hard conditions may he buy his [[peace]]: 
nor let him then enjoy supreme command; 
but fall, untimely, by some hostile hand, 
and [[lie]] unburied on the barren sand! 
these are my pray'rs, and this my dying will; 
and you, my tyrians, ev'ry curse fulfil. 
perpetual hate and mortal wars [[war]] proclaim, 
against the [[prince]], the [[people]], and the name. 
these grateful off'rings on my grave bestow; 
nor league, nor [[love]], the hostile nations know! 
now, and from hence, in ev'ry future [[age]], 
when rage excites your arms, and [[strength]] supplies the rage

rise some avenger of our libyan [[blood]], 
with [[fire]] and [[sword]] pursue the perjur'd brood; 
our arms, our seas, our shores, oppos'd to theirs; 
and the same hate descend on all our heirs!" 
this said, within her anxious [[mind]] she weighs 
the means of cutting short her odious days. 
then to sichaeus' nurse she briefly said 
(for, when she left her [[country]], hers was dead): 
"go, barce, call my sister. let her [[care]] 
the solemn rites of [[sacrifice]] prepare; 
the sheep, and all th' atoning off'rings bring, 
sprinkling her [[body]] from the crystal spring 
with living drops; then let her come, and thou 
with [[sacred]] fillets bind thy hoary brow. 
thus will i [[pay]] my vows to stygian jove, 
and end the cares [[care]] of my disastrous [[love]]; 
then cast the trojan image on the [[fire]], 
and, as that burns, my [[passions]] shall expire." 
the nurse moves onward, with officious [[care]], 
and all the speed her aged limbs can bear. 
but furious dido, with dark thoughts [[thought]] involv'd, 
shook at the mighty mischief she resolv'd. 
with livid spots distinguish'd was her face; 
red were her rolling [[eyes]], and discompos'd her pace; 
ghastly she gaz'd, with [[pain]] she drew her breath, 
and [[nature]] shiver'd at approaching [[death]]. 
then swiftly to the fatal place she pass'd, 
and mounts the fun'ral pile with furious haste; 
unsheathes the [[sword]] the trojan left behind 
(not for so dire an enterprise design'd). 
but when she view'd the garments loosely spread, 
which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed, 
she paus'd, and with a sigh the robes embrac'd; 
then on the couch her trembling [[body]] cast, 
repress'd the ready tears, and spoke her [[last]]: 
"dear pledges of my [[love]], while heav'n so pleas'd, 
receive a [[soul]], of mortal anguish eas'd: 
my fatal course is finish'd; and i go, 
a glorious name, among the ghosts below. 
a lofty [[city]] by my hands is rais'd, 
pygmalion punish'd, and my [[lord]] appeas'd. 
what could my [[fortune]] have afforded more, 
had the false trojan never touch'd my shore!" 
then kiss'd the couch; and, "must i [[die]]," she said, 
"and unreveng'd? 't is doubly to be dead! 
yet ev'n this [[death]] with [[pleasure]] i receive: 
on any terms, 't is [[better]] than to [[live]]. 
these flames, from far, may the false trojan view; 
these boding omens his base flight pursue!" 
she said, and struck; deep enter'd in her side 
the piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed: 
clogg'd in the wound the cruel weapon stands; 
the spouting [[blood]] came streaming on her hands. 
her [[sad]] attendants saw the deadly stroke, 
and with loud cries the sounding palace shook. 
distracted, from the fatal sight they fled, 
and thro' the town the dismal rumor spread. 
first from the frighted court the yell began; 
redoubled, thence from house to house it ran: 
the groans of [[men]], with shrieks, laments, and cries 
of mixing [[women]], mount the vaulted skies [[sky]]. 
not less the clamor, than if- ancient tyre, 
or the new [[carthage]], set by foes on fire- 
the rolling ruin, with their lov'd abodes, 
involv'd the blazing temples of their gods. 
her sister hears; and, furious with despair, 
she beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair, 
and, calling on eliza's name aloud, 
runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd. 
"was all that pomp of woe for this prepar'd; 
these fires [[fire]], this fun'ral pile, these altars rear'd? 
was all this train of plots contriv'd," said she, 
"all only to [[deceive]] unhappy me? 
which is the worst? didst thou in [[death]] pretend 
to scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend? 
thy summon'd sister, and thy friend, had come; 
one [[sword]] had serv'd us both, one [[common]] tomb: 
was i to raise the pile, the pow'rs invoke, 
not to be [[present]] at the fatal stroke? 
at once thou hast destroy'd thyself and me, 
thy town, thy senate, and thy colony! 
bring water; bathe the wound; while i in [[death]] 
lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath."

this said, she mounts the pile with eager haste, 
and in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd; 
her temples chaf'd; and her own garments tore, 
to stanch the streaming [[blood]], and cleanse the gore. 
thrice dido tried to raise her drooping head, 
and, fainting thrice, fell grov'ling on the bed; 
thrice op'd her heavy [[eyes]], and sought the [[light]], 
but, having found it, sicken'd at the sight, 
and clos'd her lids at [[last]] in endless night. 
then juno, grieving that she should sustain 
a [[death]] so ling'ring, and so full of [[pain]], 
sent iris down, to [[free]] her from the strife 
of lab'ring [[nature]], and dissolve her [[life]]. 
for since she died, not doom'd by heav'n's decree, 
or her own crime, but [[human]] casualty, 
and rage of [[love]], that plung'd her in despair, 
the sisters had not cut the topmost hair, 
which proserpine and they can only [[know]]; 
nor made her [[sacred]] to the shades below. 
downward the various [[goddess]] took her flight, 
and drew a thousand colors from the [[light]]; 
then stood above the dying lover's head, 
and said: "i thus devote thee to the [[dead]]. 
this off'ring to th' infernal gods i bear." 
thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair: 
the struggling [[soul]] was loos'd, and [[life]] dissolv'd in air.

book v

meantime the trojan cuts his wat'ry way, 
fix'd on his [[voyage]], thro' the curling sea; 
then, casting back his [[eyes]], with dire amaze, 
sees on the punic shore the mounting blaze. 
the cause unknown; yet his presaging [[mind]] 
the [[fate]] of dido from the [[fire]] divin'd; 
he knew the stormy souls [[soul]] of womankind, 
what secret springs their eager [[passions]] move, 
how capable of [[death]] for injur'd [[love]]. 
dire auguries from hence the trojans draw; 
till neither fires [[fire]] nor shining shores they saw. 
now seas and skies [[sky]] their prospect only bound; 
an empty space above, a floating field around. 
but soon the heav'ns with shadows were o'erspread; 
a swelling cloud hung hov'ring o'er their head: 
livid it look'd, the threat'ning of a storm: 
then night and [[horror]] ocean's face deform. 
the pilot, palinurus, cried aloud: 
"what gusts of weather from that gath'ring cloud 
my thoughts [[thought]] presage! ere yet the tempest roars, 
stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars; 
contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind." 
the frighted crew perform the task assign'd. 
then, to his fearless [[chief]]: "not heav'n," said he, 
"tho' jove himself should promise [[italy]], 
can stem the torrent of this raging sea. 
mark how the shifting winds from west arise, 
and what collected night involves the skies! 
nor can our shaken vessels [[live]] at sea, 
much less against the tempest [[force]] their way. 
't is [[fate]] diverts our course, and [[fate]] we must obey. 
not far from hence, if i observ'd aright 
the southing of the stars, and polar [[light]], 
sicilia lies [[lie]], whose hospitable shores 
in safety we may reach with struggling oars." 
aeneas then replied: "too sure i find 
we strive in [[vain]] against the seas and wind: 
now shift your sails; what place can please me more 
than what you promise, the sicilian shore, 
whose hallow'd [[earth]] anchises' bones contains, 
and where a [[prince]] of trojan lineage reigns?" 
the course resolv'd, before the western wind 
they scud amain, and make the port assign'd. 
meantime acestes, from a lofty stand, 
beheld the fleet descending on the [[land]]; 
and, not unmindful of his ancient [[race]], 
down from the cliff he ran with eager pace, 
and held the hero in a strict embrace. 
of a rough libyan bear the spoils he wore, 
and either hand a pointed jav'lin bore. 
his [[mother]] was a dame of dardan [[blood]]; 
his sire crinisus, a sicilian flood. 
he welcomes his returning [[friends]] ashore 
with plenteous [[country]] cates and homely store. 
now, when the following morn had chas'd away 
the flying stars, and [[light]] restor'd the day, 
aeneas call'd the trojan [[troops]] around, 
and thus bespoke them from a rising ground: 
"offspring of heav'n, [[divine]] dardanian race! 
the sun, revolving thro' th' ethereal space, 
the shining circle of the year has fill'd, 
since first this isle my father's ashes held: 
and now the rising day renews the year; 
a day for ever [[sad]], for ever dear. 
this would i celebrate with annual games, 
with gifts on altars pil'd, and holy flames, 
tho' banish'd to gaetulia's barren sands, 
caught on the grecian seas, or hostile lands [[land]]: 
but since this [[happy]] storm our fleet has driv'n 
(not, as i deem, without the will of heav'n) 
upon these friendly shores and flow'ry plains, 
which hide anchises and his blest remains, 
let us with joy perform his honors due, 
and [[pray]] for prosp'rous winds, our [[voyage]] to renew; 
pray, that in towns and temples of our own, 
the name of [[great]] anchises may be known, 
and yearly games may spread the gods' renown. 
our sports [[sport]] acestes, of the trojan [[race]], 
with [[royal]] gifts ordain'd, is pleas'd to grace: 
two steers on ev'ry ship the [[king]] bestows; 
his gods and ours shall share your [[equal]] vows. 
besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn 
shall with unclouded [[light]] the skies [[sky]] adorn, 
that day with solemn sports [[sport]] i mean to grace: 
light galleys on the seas shall run a wat'ry [[race]]; 
some shall in swiftness for the goal contend, 
and others try the twanging bow to bend; 
the [[strong]], with iron gauntlets arm'd, shall stand 
oppos'd in combat on the yellow sand. 
let all be [[present]] at the games prepar'd, 
and joyful victors wait the just [[reward]]. 
but now assist the rites, with garlands crown'd." 
he said, and first his brows with myrtle bound. 
then helymus, by his [[example]] [[led]], 
and old acestes, each adorn'd his head; 
thus [[young]] ascanius, with a sprightly grace, 
his temples tied, and all the trojan [[race]]. 
aeneas then advanc'd amidst the train, 
by thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain, 
to [[great]] anchises' tomb; which when he found, 
he pour'd to bacchus, on the hallow'd ground, 
two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more, 
and two (from offer'd bulls) of purple gore, 
with roses then the sepulcher he strow'd 
and thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud: 
"hail, o ye holy manes! hail again, 
paternal ashes, now review'd in vain! 
the gods permitted not, that you, with me, 
should reach the promis'd shores of [[italy]], 
or tiber's flood, what flood soe'er it be." 
scarce had he finish'd, when, with speckled [[pride]], 
a serpent from the tomb began to glide; 
his hugy bulk on sev'n high volumes roll'd; 
blue was his breadth of back, but streak'd with scaly gold:

thus riding on his curls, he seem'd to pass 
a rolling [[fire]] along, and singe the grass. 
more various colors thro' his [[body]] run, 
than iris when her bow imbibes the sun. 
betwixt the rising altars, and around, 
the [[sacred]] monster shot along the ground; 
with harmless play amidst the bowls he pass'd, 
and with his lolling tongue assay'd the taste: 
thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest 
within the hollow tomb retir'd to rest. 
the pious [[prince]], surpris'd at what he view'd, 
the fun'ral honors with more zeal renew'd, 
doubtful if this place's genius were, 
or guardian of his father's sepulcher. 
five sheep, according to the rites, he slew; 
as many swine, and steers of sable hue; 
new gen'rous wine he from the goblets pour'd. 
and call'd his father's ghost, from hell restor'd. 
the glad attendants in long order come, 
off'ring their gifts at [[great]] anchises' tomb: 
some add more oxen: some divide the spoil; 
some place the chargers on the grassy soil; 
some blow the fires [[fire]], and off entrails broil. 
now came the day desir'd. the skies [[sky]] were bright 
with rosy luster of the rising [[light]]: 
the bord'ring [[people]], rous'd by sounding fame 
of trojan feasts and [[great]] acestes' name, 
the crowded shore with acclamations fill, 
part to behold, and part to prove their [[skill]]. 
and first the gifts in [[public]] view they place, 
green laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors' grace: 
within the circle, arms and tripods [[lie]], 
ingots of gold and silver, heap'd on high, 
and vests embroider'd, of the tyrian dye. 
the trumpet's clangor then the feast proclaims, 
and all prepare for their appointed games. 
four galleys first, which [[equal]] rowers bear, 
advancing, in the wat'ry lists appear. 
the speedy dolphin, that outstrips the wind, 
bore mnestheus, author of the memmian [[kind]]: 
gyas the vast chimaera's bulk commands, 
which rising, like a tow'ring [[city]] stands; 
three trojans tug at ev'ry lab'ring oar; 
three banks in three degrees [[degree]] the sailors bore; 
beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar. 
sergesthus, who began the sergian [[race]], 
in the [[great]] centaur took the leading place; 
cloanthus on the sea-green scylla stood, 
from whom cluentius draws his trojan [[blood]]. 
far in the sea, against the foaming shore, 
there stands a rock: the raging billows roar 
above his head in storms; but, when 't is clear, 
uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear. 
in [[peace]] below the gentle waters run; 
the cormorants above [[lie]] basking in the sun. 
on this the hero fix'd an oak in sight, 
the mark to guide the mariners aright. 
to bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars; 
then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores.

the lots decide their place. above the rest, 
each leader shining in his tyrian vest; 
the [[common]] crew with wreaths of poplar boughs 
their temples [[crown]], and shade their sweaty brows: 
besmear'd with [[oil]], their naked shoulders shine. 
all take their seats, and wait the sounding sign: 
they gripe their oars; and ev'ry panting breast 
is rais'd by turns with [[hope]], by turns with [[fear]] depress'd.

the clangor of the trumpet gives the sign; 
at once they start, advancing in a line: 
with shouts the sailors rend the starry skies [[sky]]; 
lash'd with their oars, the smoky billows rise; 
sparkles the briny main, and the vex'd ocean fries. 
exact in [[time]], with [[equal]] strokes they row: 
at once the brushing oars and brazen prow 
dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below. 
not fiery coursers, in a chariot [[race]], 
invade the field with half so swift a pace; 
not the fierce driver with more fury lends 
the sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends, 
low to the wheels his pliant [[body]] bends. 
the partial crowd their hopes [[hope]] and fears [[fear]] divide, 
and aid with eager shouts the favor'd side. 
cries, murmurs, clamors, with a mixing sound, 
from woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound. 
amidst the loud applauses of the shore, 
gyas outstripp'd the rest, and sprung before: 
cloanthus, [[better]] mann'd, pursued him fast, 
but his o'er-masted galley check'd his haste. 
the centaur and the dolphin brush the brine 
with [[equal]] oars, advancing in a line; 
and now the mighty centaur seems to lead, 
and now the speedy dolphin gets ahead; 
now board to board the rival vessels row, 
the billows lave the skies [[sky]], and ocean groans below. 
they reach'd the mark. proud gyas and his train 
in triumph rode, the victors of the main; 
but, steering round, he charg'd his pilot stand 
more close to shore, and skim along the sand- 
"let others bear to sea!" menoetes heard; 
but secret shelves too cautiously he fear'd, 
and, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer'd.

with louder cries the captain call'd again: 
"bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main." 
he spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw 
the bold cloanthus near the shelvings draw. 
betwixt the mark and him the scylla stood, 
and in a closer compass plow'd the flood. 
he pass'd the mark; and, wheeling, got before: 
gyas blasphem'd the gods, devoutly swore, 
cried out for anger, and his hair he tore. 
mindless of others' lives [[life]] (so high was grown 
his rising rage) and careless of his own, 
the trembling dotard to the deck he drew; 
then hoisted up, and overboard he threw: 
this done, he seiz'd the helm; his fellows cheer'd, 
turn'd short upon the shelfs, and madly steer'd. 
hardly his head the plunging pilot rears, 
clogg'd with his clothes, and cumber'd with his years: 
now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with [[pain]]. 
the crowd, that saw him fall and float again, 
shout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh'd, 
to see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught. 
the following centaur, and the dolphin's crew, 
their vanish'd hopes [[hope]] of [[victory]] renew; 
while gyas lags, they kindle in the [[race]], 
to reach the mark. sergesthus takes the place; 
mnestheus pursues; and while around they wind, 
comes up, not half his galley's length behind; 
then, on the deck, amidst his mates appear'd, 
and thus their drooping [[courage]] he cheer'd: 
"my [[friends]], and hector's followers heretofore, 
exert your vigor; tug the lab'ring oar; 
stretch to your strokes, my still unconquer'd crew, 
whom from the flaming walls of troy i drew. 
in this, our [[common]] int'rest, let me find 
that [[strength]] of hand, that [[courage]] of the [[mind]], 
as when you stemm'd the [[strong]] malean flood, 
and o'er the syrtes' broken billows row'd. 
i seek not now the foremost palm to gain; 
tho' yet- but, ah! that haughty [[wish]] is vain! 
let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain. 
but to be [[last]], the lags of all the race!- 
redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace." 
now, one and all, they tug amain; they row 
at the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow. 
the sea beneath 'em sinks; their lab'ring sides 
are swell'd, and sweat runs gutt'ring down in tides. 
chance aids their daring with unhop'd [[success]]; 
sergesthus, eager with his beak to press 
betwixt the rival galley and the rock, 
shuts up th' unwieldly centaur in the lock. 
the vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock, 
her oars she shiver'd, and her head she broke. 
the trembling rowers from their banks arise, 
and, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize. 
with iron poles they heave her off the shores, 
and gather from the sea their floating oars. 
the crew of mnestheus, with elated minds [[mind]], 
urge their [[success]], and call the willing winds; 
then ply their oars, and cut their liquid way 
in larger compass on the roomy sea. 
as, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes, 
rous'd in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes; 
the cavern rings with clatt'ring; out she flies, 
and leaves her callow [[care]], and cleaves the skies [[sky]]: 
at first she flutters; but at length she springs 
to smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings: 
so mnestheus in the dolphin cuts the sea; 
and, flying with a [[force]], that [[force]] assists his way. 
sergesthus in the centaur soon he pass'd, 
wedg'd in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast. 
in [[vain]] the victor he with cries implores, 
and practices to row with shatter'd oars. 
then mnestheus bears with gyas, and outflies: 
the ship, without a pilot, yields the prize. 
unvanquish'd scylla now alone remains; 
her he pursues, and all his vigor strains. 
shouts from the fav'ring multitude arise; 
applauding echo to the shouts replies; 
shouts, wishes [[wish]], and applause run rattling thro' the skies [[sky]].

these clamors with disdain the scylla heard, 
much grudg'd the [[praise]], but more the robb'd [[reward]]: 
resolv'd to hold their own, they mend their pace, 
all obstinate to [[die]], or gain the [[race]]. 
rais'd with [[success]], the dolphin swiftly ran; 
for they can conquer, who [[believe]] they can. 
both urge their oars, and [[fortune]] both supplies, 
and both perhaps had shar'd an [[equal]] prize; 
when to the seas cloanthus holds his hands, 
and succor from the wat'ry pow'rs demands: 
"gods of the liquid realms, on which i row! 
if, giv'n by you, the laurel bind my brow, 
assist to make me guilty of my vow! 
a snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain; 
his offer'd entrails cast into the main, 
and ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown, 
your grateful gift and my return shall own." 
the choir of nymphs [[nymph]], and phorcus, from below, 
with virgin panopea, heard his vow; 
and old portunus, with his breadth of hand, 
push'd on, and sped the galley to the [[land]]. 
swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies, 
and, darting to the port, obtains the prize. 
the herald summons all, and then proclaims 
cloanthus conqu'ror of the naval games. 
the [[prince]] with laurel crowns [[crown]] the victor's head, 
and three fat steers are to his vessel [[led]], 
the ship's [[reward]]; with gen'rous wine beside, 
and sums of silver, which the crew divide. 
the leaders are distinguish'd from the rest; 
the victor honor'd with a nobler vest, 
where gold and purple strive in [[equal]] rows, 
and needlework its [[happy]] cost bestows. 
there ganymede is wrought with living art [[arts]], 
chasing thro' ida's groves the trembling hart: 
breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue; 
when from aloft descends, in open view, 
the bird of jove, and, sousing on his prey, 
with crooked talons bears the boy away. 
in [[vain]], with lifted hands and gazing [[eyes]], 
his guards behold him soaring thro' the skies [[sky]], 
and dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries. 
mnestheus the second victor was declar'd; 
and, summon'd there, the second prize he shard. 
a coat of mail, brave demoleus bore, 
more brave [[aeneas]] from his shoulders tore, 
in [[single]] combat on the trojan shore: 
this was ordain'd for mnestheus to possess; 
in [[war]] for his defense, for ornament in [[peace]]. 
rich was the gift, and glorious to behold, 
but yet so pond'rous with its plates of gold, 
that scarce two servants could the weight sustain; 
yet, loaded thus, demoleus o'er the plain 
pursued and lightly seiz'd the trojan train. 
the third, succeeding to the [[last]] [[reward]], 
two goodly bowls of massy silver shar'd, 
with figures prominent, and richly wrought, 
and two brass caldrons from dodona brought. 
thus all, rewarded by the hero's hands, 
their conqu'ring temples bound with purple bands; 
and now sergesthus, clearing from the rock, 
brought back his galley shatter'd with the shock. 
forlorn she look'd, without an aiding oar, 
and, houted by the vulgar, made to shore. 
as when a snake, surpris'd upon the road, 
is crush'd athwart her [[body]] by the load 
of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound 
her belly bruis'd, and trodden to the ground: 
in [[vain]], with loosen'd curls, she crawls along; 
yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue; 
glares with her [[eyes]], and bristles with her scales; 
but, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails:

so slowly to the port the centaur tends, 
but, what she wants in oars, with sails amends. 
yet, for his galley sav'd, the grateful [[prince]] 
is pleas'd th' unhappy [[chief]] to recompense. 
pholoe, the cretan [[slave]], rewards [[reward]] his [[care]], 
beauteous herself, with lovely twins as [[fair]]. 
from thence his way the trojan hero bent 
into the neighb'ring plain, with mountains pent, 
whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood. 
full in the midst of this [[fair]] valley stood 
a native theater, which, rising slow 
by just degrees [[degree]], o'erlook'd the ground below. 
high on a sylvan [[throne]] the leader sate; 
a num'rous train attend in solemn [[state]]. 
here those that in the rapid course delight, 
desire of [[honor]] and the prize invite. 
the rival runners without order stand; 
the trojans mix'd with the sicilian band. 
first nisus, with euryalus, appears; 
euryalus a boy of blooming years, 
with sprightly grace and [[equal]] [[beauty]] crown'd; 
nisus, for [[friendship]] to the [[youth]] renown'd. 
diores next, of priam's [[royal]] [[race]], 
then salius joined with patron, took their place; 
(but patron in arcadia had his birth, 
and salius his from arcananian [[earth]];) 
then two sicilian youths- the names of these, 
swift helymus, and lovely panopes: 
both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred, 
and owning old acestes for their head; 
with sev'ral others of ignobler name, 
whom [[time]] has not deliver'd o'er to fame. 
to these the hero thus his thoughts [[thought]] explain'd, 
in words which gen'ral approbation gain'd: 
"one [[common]] largess is for all design'd, 
(the vanquish'd and the victor shall be join'd,) 
two darts of polish'd steel and gnosian wood, 
a silver-studded ax, alike bestow'd. 
the foremost three have olive wreaths decreed: 
the first of these obtains a stately steed, 
adorn'd with trappings; and the next in fame, 
the quiver of an amazonian dame, 
with feather'd thracian arrows well supplied: 
a golden belt shall gird his manly side, 
which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied. 
the third this grecian helmet shall content." 
he said. to their appointed base they went; 
with beating hearts [[heart]] th' expected sign receive, 
and, starting all at once, the barrier leave. 
spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew, 
and seiz'd the distant goal with greedy view. 
shot from the crowd, swift nisus all o'erpass'd; 
nor storms, nor thunder, [[equal]] half his haste. 
the next, but tho' the next, yet far disjoin'd, 
came salius, and euryalus behind; 
then helymus, whom [[young]] diores plied, 
step after step, and almost side by side, 
his shoulders pressing; and, in longer space, 
had won, or left at least a dubious [[race]]. 
now, spent, the goal they almost reach at [[last]], 
when eager nisus, hapless in his haste, 
slipp'd first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain, 
soak'd with the [[blood]] of oxen newly slain. 
the careless victor had not mark'd his way; 
but, treading where the treach'rous puddle lay, 
his heels flew up; and on the grassy floor 
he fell, besmear'd with filth and holy gore. 
not mindless then, euryalus, of thee, 
nor of the [[sacred]] bonds of amity, 
he strove th' immediate rival's [[hope]] to cross, 
and caught the foot of salius as he rose. 
so salius lay extended on the plain; 
euryalus springs out, the prize to gain, 
and leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend 
the victor to the goal, who vanquish'd by his friend. 
next helymus; and then diores came, 
by two misfortunes made the third in fame. 
but salius enters, and, exclaiming loud 
for [[justice]], deafens and disturbs the crowd; 
urges his cause may in the court be heard; 
and pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr'd. 
but favor for euryalus appears; 
his blooming [[beauty]], with his tender tears, 
had brib'd the judges [[judge]] for the promis'd prize. 
besides, diores fills the court with cries, 
who vainly reaches at the [[last]] [[reward]], 
if the first palm on salius be conferr'd. 
then thus the [[prince]]: "let no disputes arise: 
where [[fortune]] plac'd it, i award the prize. 
but fortune's errors give me leave to mend, 
at least to [[pity]] my deserving friend." 
he said, and, from among the spoils, he draws 
(pond'rous with shaggy mane and golden paws) 
a lion's hide: to salius this he gives. 
nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves. 
"if such rewards [[reward]] to vanquish'd [[men]] are due." 
he said, "and falling is to rise by you, 
what prize may nisus from your bounty claim, 
who merited the first rewards [[reward]] and fame? 
in falling, both an [[equal]] [[fortune]] tried; 
would [[fortune]] for my fall so well provide!" 
with this he pointed to his face, and show'd 
his hand and all his habit smear'd with [[blood]]. 
th' indulgent [[father]] of the [[people]] smil'd, 
and caus'd to be produc'd an ample shield, 
of wondrous art [[arts]], by didymaon wrought, 
long since from neptune's bars in triumph brought. 
this giv'n to nisus, he divides the rest, 
and [[equal]] [[justice]] in his gifts express'd. 
the [[race]] thus ended, and rewards [[reward]] bestow'd, 
once more the princes [[prince]] bespeaks th' attentive crowd: 
"if there he here whose dauntless [[courage]] dare 
in gauntlet-fight, with limbs and [[body]] bare, 
his opposite sustain in open view, 
stand forth the champion, and the games renew. 
two prizes i propose, and thus divide: 
a bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied, 
shall be the portion of the conqu'ring [[chief]]; 
a [[sword]] and helm shall cheer the loser's [[grief]]." 
then haughty dares in the lists appears; 
stalking he strides, his head erected bears: 
his nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield, 
and loud applauses echo thro' the field. 
dares alone in combat us'd to stand 
the match of mighty [[paris]], hand to hand; 
the same, at hector's fun'rals, undertook 
gigantic butes, of th' amycian stock, 
and, by the stroke of his resistless hand, 
stretch'd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand. 
such dares was; and such he strode along, 
and drew the wonder of the gazing throng. 
his brawny back and ample breast he shows, 
his lifted arms around his head he throws, 
and deals in whistling air his empty blows. 
his match is sought; but, thro' the trembling band, 
not one dares [[answer]] to the proud demand. 
presuming of his [[force]], with sparkling [[eyes]] 
already he devours the promis'd prize. 
he claims the bull with awless insolence, 
and having seiz'd his horns, accosts the [[prince]]: 
"if none my matchless valor dares oppose, 
how long shall dares wait his dastard foes? 
permit me, [[chief]], permit without delay, 
to lead this uncontended gift away." 
the crowd assents, and with redoubled cries 
for the proud challenger demands the prize. 
acestes, fir'd with just disdain, to see 
the palm usurp'd without a [[victory]], 
reproach'd entellus thus, who sate beside, 
and heard and saw, unmov'd, the trojan's [[pride]]: 
"once, but in [[vain]], a champion of renown, 
so tamely can you bear the ravish'd [[crown]], 
a prize in triumph borne before your sight, 
and shun, for [[fear]], the danger of the [[fight]]? 
where is our eryx now, the boasted name, 
the [[god]] who taught your thund'ring arm the game? 
where now your baffled [[honor]]? where the spoil 
that fill'd your house, and fame that fill'd our isle?" 
entellus, thus: "my [[soul]] is still the same, 
unmov'd with [[fear]], and mov'd with martial fame; 
but my chill [[blood]] is curdled in my veins, 
and scarce the shadow of a [[man]] remains. 
o could i turn to that [[fair]] prime again, 
that prime of which this boaster is so [[vain]], 
the brave, who this decrepid [[age]] defies, 
should [[feel]] my [[force]], without the promis'd prize." 
he said; and, rising at the word, he threw 
two pond'rous gauntlets down in open view; 
gauntlets which eryx wont in [[fight]] to wield, 
and sheathe his hands with in the listed field. 
with [[fear]] and wonder seiz'd, the crowd beholds 
the gloves of [[death]], with sev'n distinguish'd folds 
of tough bull hides; the space within is spread 
with iron, or with loads of heavy lead: 
dares himself was daunted at the sight, 
renounc'd his challenge, and refus'd to [[fight]]. 
astonish'd at their weight, the hero stands, 
and pois'd the pond'rous engines in his hands. 
"what had your wonder," said entellus, "been, 
had you the gauntlets of alcides seen, 
or view'd the stern debate on this unhappy green! 
these which i bear your [[brother]] eryx bore, 
still mark'd with batter'd brains and mingled gore. 
with these he long sustain'd th' herculean arm; 
and these i wielded while my [[blood]] was warm, 
this languish'd frame while [[better]] spirits fed, 
ere [[age]] unstrung my nerves, or [[time]] o'ersnow'd my head. 
but if the challenger these arms refuse, 
and cannot wield their weight, or dare not use; 
if [[great]] [[aeneas]] and acestes join 
in his request, these gauntlets i resign; 
let us with [[equal]] arms perform the [[fight]], 
and let him leave to [[fear]], since i resign my [[right]]." 
this said, entellus for the strife prepares; 
stripp'd of his quilted coat, his [[body]] bares; 
compos'd of mighty bones and brawn he stands, 
a goodly tow'ring object on the sands. 
then just [[aeneas]] [[equal]] arms supplied, 
which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied. 
both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent, 
their arms aloft, their bodies [[body]] inly bent; 
their heads from aiming blows they bear afar; 
with clashing gauntlets then provoke the [[war]]. 
one on his [[youth]] and pliant limbs relies; 
one on his sinews and his giant size. 
the [[last]] is stiff with [[age]], his motion slow; 
he heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro, 
and clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow. 
yet [[equal]] in [[success]], they ward, they strike; 
their ways are diff'rent, but their art [[arts]] alike. 
before, behind, the blows are dealt; around 
their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound. 
a storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies, 
and errs about their temples, ears, and [[eyes]]. 
nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws 
a sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws. 
heavy with [[age]], entellus stands his ground, 
but with his warping [[body]] wards the wound. 
his hand and watchful eye keep even pace; 
while dares traverses and shifts his place, 
and, like a captain who beleaguers round 
some strong-built castle on a rising ground, 
views all th' approaches with observing [[eyes]]: 
this and that other part in [[vain]] he tries, 
and more on industry than [[force]] relies. 
with hands on high, entellus threats the foe; 
but dares watch'd the motion from below, 
and slipp'd aside, and shunn'd the long descending blow.

entellus wastes his forces [[force]] on the wind, 
and, thus deluded of the stroke design'd, 
headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast 
and weighty limbs his ancient [[mother]] press'd. 
so falls a hollow pine, that long had stood 
on ida's height, or erymanthus' wood, 
torn from the roots. the diff'ring nations rise, 
and shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies [[sky]], 
acestus runs with eager haste, to raise 
the fall'n companion of his youthful days. 
dauntless he rose, and to the [[fight]] return'd; 
with shame his glowing cheeks, his [[eyes]] with fury burn'd.

disdain and conscious [[virtue]] fir'd his breast, 
and with redoubled [[force]] his foe he press'd. 
he lays on load with either hand, amain, 
and headlong drives the trojan o'er the plain; 
nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows; 
but storms of strokes descend about his brows, 
a rattling tempest, and a hail of blows. 
but now the [[prince]], who saw the wild increase 
of wounds, commands the combatants to cease, 
and bounds entellus' wrath, and bids the [[peace]]. 
first to the trojan, spent with toil, he came, 
and sooth'd his [[sorrow]] for the suffer'd shame. 
"what fury seiz'd my friend? the gods," said he, 
"to him propitious, and averse to thee, 
have giv'n his arm superior [[force]] to thine. 
't is madness to contend with [[strength]] [[divine]]." 
the gauntlet [[fight]] thus ended, from the shore 
his faithful [[friends]] unhappy dares bore: 
his mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood, 
and pounded teeth came rushing with his [[blood]]. 
faintly he stagger'd thro' the hissing throng, 
and hung his head, and trail'd his legs along. 
the [[sword]] and casque are carried by his train; 
but with his foe the palm and ox remain. 
the champion, then, before [[aeneas]] came, 
proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame: 
"o goddess-born, and you, dardanian host, 
mark with attention, and [[forgive]] my boast; 
learn what i was, by what remains; and [[know]] 
from what impending [[fate]] you sav'd my foe." 
sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull; 
and, on his ample forehead aiming full, 
the deadly stroke, descending, pierc'd the skull. 
down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound, 
but sprawls in pangs of [[death]], and spurns the ground. 
then, thus: "in dares' stead i offer this. 
eryx, accept a nobler [[sacrifice]]; 
take the [[last]] gift my wither'd arms can yield: 
thy gauntlets i resign, and here renounce the field." 
this done, [[aeneas]] orders, for the close, 
the strife of archers with contending bows. 
the mast sergesthus' shatter'd galley bore 
with his own hands he raises on the shore. 
a flutt'ring dove upon the top they tie, 
the living mark at which their arrows fly. 
the rival archers in a line advance, 
their turn of shooting to receive from [[chance]]. 
a helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn: 
on the first scroll was [[read]] hippocoon. 
the [[people]] shout. upon the next was found 
young mnestheus, late with naval honors crown'd. 
the third contain'd eurytion's [[noble]] name, 
thy [[brother]], pandarus, and next in fame, 
whom pallas urg'd the treaty to confound, 
and send among the greeks [[greek]] a feather'd wound. 
acestes in the bottom [[last]] remain'd, 
whom not his [[age]] from youthful sports [[sport]] restrain'd. 
soon all with vigor bend their trusty bows, 
and from the quiver each his arrow chose. 
hippocoon's was the first: with forceful sway 
it flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way. 
fix'd in the mast the feather'd weapon stands: 
the fearful pigeon flutters in her bands, 
and the tree trembled, and the shouting cries 
of the pleas'd [[people]] rend the vaulted skies [[sky]]. 
then mnestheus to the head his arrow drove, 
with lifted [[eyes]], and took his aim above, 
but made a glancing shot, and missed the dove; 
yet miss'd so narrow, that he cut the cord 
which fasten'd by the foot the flitting bird. 
the captive thus releas'd, away she flies, 
and beats with clapping wings the yielding skies [[sky]]. 
his bow already bent, eurytion stood; 
and, having first invok'd his [[brother]] [[god]], 
his winged shaft with eager haste he sped. 
the fatal message reach'd her as she fled: 
she leaves her [[life]] aloft; she strikes the ground, 
and renders back the weapon in the wound. 
acestes, grudging at his lot, remains, 
without a prize to gratify his pains [[pain]]. 
yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show 
an archer's art [[arts]], and boast his twanging bow. 
the feather'd arrow gave a dire portent, 
and latter augurs [[judge]] from this event. 
chaf'd by the speed, it fir'd; and, as it flew, 
a trail of following flames ascending drew: 
kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way; 
across the skies [[sky]] as falling meteors play, 
and vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay. 
the trojans and sicilians wildly stare, 
and, trembling, turn their wonder into pray'r. 
the dardan [[prince]] put on a smiling face, 
and strain'd acestes with a close embrace; 
then, hon'ring him with gifts above the rest, 
turn'd the [[bad]] omen, nor his fears [[fear]] confess'd. 
"the gods," said he, "this miracle have wrought, 
and order'd you the prize without the lot. 
accept this goblet, rough with figur'd gold, 
which thracian cisseus gave my sire of old: 
this pledge of ancient amity receive, 
which to my second sire i justly give." 
he said, and, with the trumpets' cheerful sound, 
proclaim'd him victor, and with laurel-crown'd. 
nor [[good]] eurytion envied him the prize, 
tho' he transfix'd the pigeon in the skies [[sky]]. 
who cut the line, with second gifts was grac'd; 
the third was his whose arrow pierc'd the mast. 
the [[chief]], before the games were wholly done, 
call'd periphantes, tutor to his [[son]], 
and whisper'd thus: "with speed ascanius find; 
and, if his childish troop be ready join'd, 
on horseback let him grace his grandsire's day, 
and lead his equals [[equal]] arm'd in just array." 
he said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears. 
the crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears. 
and now the [[noble]] youths [[youth]], of form [[divine]], 
advance before their fathers [[father]], in a line; 
the riders grace the steeds; the steeds with [[glory]] shine.

thus marching on in [[military]] [[pride]], 
shouts of applause resound from side to side. 
their casques adorn'd with laurel wreaths they wear, 
each brandishing aloft a cornel spear. 
some at their backs their gilded quivers bore; 
their chains of burnish'd gold hung down before. 
three graceful [[troops]] they form'd upon the green; 
three graceful leaders at their head were seen; 
twelve follow'd ev'ry [[chief]], and left a space between. 
the first [[young]] priam [[led]]; a lovely boy, 
whose grandsire was th' unhappy [[king]] of troy; 
his [[race]] in after times [[time]] was known to fame, 
new honors adding to the latian name; 
and well the [[royal]] boy his thracian steed became. 
white were the fetlocks of his feet before, 
and on his front a snowy star he bore. 
then beauteous atys, with iulus bred, 
of [[equal]] [[age]], the second squadron [[led]]. 
the [[last]] in order, but the first in place, 
first in the lovely features of his face, 
rode [[fair]] ascanius on a fiery steed, 
queen dido's gift, and of the tyrian breed. 
sure coursers for the rest the [[king]] ordains, 
with golden bits adorn'd, and purple reins. 
the pleas'd spectators peals of shouts renew, 
and all the parents in the [[children]] view; 
their make, their motions, and their sprightly grace, 
and hopes [[hope]] and fears [[fear]] alternate in their face. 
th' unfledg'd commanders and their martial train 
first make the circuit of the sandy plain 
around their sires, and, at th' appointed sign, 
drawn up in beauteous order, form a line. 
the second signal sounds, the troop divides 
in three distinguish'd parts, with three distinguish'd guides

again they close, and once again disjoin; 
in troop to troop oppos'd, and line to line. 
they meet; they wheel; they throw their darts afar 
with harmless rage and well-dissembled [[war]]. 
then in a round the mingled bodies [[body]] run: 
flying they [[follow]], and pursuing shun; 
broken, they break; and, rallying, they renew 
in other forms the [[military]] shew. 
at [[last]], in order, undiscern'd they join, 
and march together in a friendly line. 
and, as the cretan labyrinth of old, 
with wand'ring ways and many a winding fold, 
involv'd the weary feet, without redress, 
in a round error, which denied recess; 
so fought the trojan boys in warlike play, 
turn'd and return'd, and still a diff'rent way. 
thus dolphins in the deep each other chase 
in circles, when they swim around the wat'ry [[race]]. 
this game, these carousels, ascanius taught; 
and, building alba, to the latins brought; 
shew'd what he learn'd: the latin sires impart 
to their succeeding sons [[son]] the graceful art [[arts]]; 
from these imperial [[rome]] receiv'd the game, 
which troy, the youths [[youth]] the trojan troop, they name. 
thus far the [[sacred]] sports [[sport]] they celebrate: 
but [[fortune]] soon resum'd her ancient hate; 
for, while they [[pay]] the [[dead]] his annual dues, 
those envied rites saturnian juno views; 
and sends the [[goddess]] of the various bow, 
to try new methods of [[revenge]] below; 
supplies the winds to wing her airy way, 
where in the port secure the navy lay. 
swiftly [[fair]] iris down her arch descends, 
and, undiscern'd, her fatal [[voyage]] ends. 
she saw the gath'ring crowd; and, gliding thence, 
the desart shore, and fleet without defense. 
the trojan matrons, on the sands alone, 
with sighs and tears anchises' [[death]] bemoan; 
then, turning to the sea their weeping [[eyes]], 
their [[pity]] to themselves renews their cries. 
"alas!" said one, "what oceans yet remain 
for us to sail! what labors to sustain!" 
all take the word, and, with a gen'ral groan, 
implore the gods for [[peace]], and places of their own. 
the [[goddess]], [[great]] in mischief, views their pains [[pain]], 
and in a woman's form her heav'nly limbs restrains. 
in face and shape old beroe she became, 
doryclus' [[wife]], a venerable dame, 
once blest with riches [[rich]], and a mother's name. 
thus chang'd, amidst the crying crowd she ran, 
mix'd with the matrons, and these words began: 
"o wretched we, whom not the grecian pow'r, 
nor flames, destroy'd, in troy's unhappy hour! 
o wretched we, reserv'd by cruel [[fate]], 
beyond the ruins of the sinking state! 
now sev'n revolving years are wholly run, 
since this improsp'rous [[voyage]] we begun; 
since, toss'd from shores to shores, from lands [[land]] to lands [[land]],

inhospitable rocks and barren sands, 
wand'ring in [[exile]] thro' the stormy sea, 
we search in [[vain]] for flying [[italy]]. 
now cast by [[fortune]] on this kindred [[land]], 
what should our rest and rising walls withstand, 
or hinder here to fix our banish'd band? 
o [[country]] lost, and gods redeem'd in [[vain]], 
if still in endless [[exile]] we remain! 
shall we no more the trojan walls renew, 
or streams of some dissembled simois view! 
haste, join with me, th' unhappy fleet consume! 
cassandra bids; and i declare her doom. 
in sleep i saw her; she supplied my hands 
(for this i more than dreamt) with flaming brands: 
'with these,' said she, 'these wand'ring ships [[destroy]]: 
these are your fatal seats, and this your troy.' 
time calls you now; the precious hour employ: 
slack not the [[good]] presage, while heav'n inspires 
our minds [[mind]] to dare, and gives the ready fires [[fire]]. 
see! neptune's altars minister their brands: 
the [[god]] is pleas'd; the [[god]] supplies our hands." 
then from the pile a flaming [[fire]] she drew, 
and, toss'd in air, amidst the galleys threw. 
wrapp'd in amaze, the matrons wildly stare: 
then pyrgo, reverenc'd for her hoary hair, 
pyrgo, the nurse of priam's num'rous [[race]]: 
"no beroe this, tho' she belies her face! 
what terrors from her frowning front arise! 
behold a [[goddess]] in her ardent eyes! 
what rays around her heav'nly face are seen! 
mark her majestic voice, and more than mortal mien! 
beroe but now i left, whom, pin'd with [[pain]], 
her [[age]] and anguish from these rites detain," 
she said. the matrons, seiz'd with new amaze, 
roll their malignant [[eyes]], and on the navy gaze. 
they [[fear]], and [[hope]], and neither part obey: 
they [[hope]] the fated [[land]], but [[fear]] the fatal way. 
the [[goddess]], having done her task below, 
mounts up on [[equal]] wings, and bends her painted bow. 
struck with the sight, and seiz'd with rage [[divine]], 
the matrons prosecute their mad design: 
they shriek aloud; they snatch, with impious hands, 
the food of altars; fires [[fire]] and flaming brands. 
green boughs and saplings, mingled in their haste, 
and smoking torches, on the ships they cast. 
the flame, unstopp'd at first, more fury gains, 
and vulcan rides at large with loosen'd reins: 
triumphant to the painted sterns he soars, 
and seizes, in this way, the banks and crackling oars. 
eumelus was the first the news to bear, 
while yet they crowd the rural theater. 
then, what they hear, is witness'd by their [[eyes]]: 
a storm of sparkles and of flames arise. 
ascanius took th' alarm, while yet he [[led]] 
his early warriors on his prancing steed, 
and, spurring on, his equals [[equal]] soon o'erpass'd; 
nor could his frighted [[friends]] reclaim his haste. 
soon as the [[royal]] [[youth]] appear'd in view, 
he sent his voice before him as he flew: 
"what madness moves you, matrons, to [[destroy]] 
the [[last]] remainders of unhappy troy! 
not hostile fleets, but your own hopes [[hope]], you burn, 
and on your [[friends]] your fatal fury turn. 
behold your own ascanius!" while he said, 
he drew his glitt'ring helmet from his head, 
in which the youths [[youth]] to sportful arms he [[led]]. 
by this, [[aeneas]] and his train appear; 
and now the [[women]], seiz'd with shame and [[fear]], 
dispers'd, to woods and caverns take their flight, 
abhor their actions, and avoid the [[light]]; 
their [[friends]] acknowledge, and their error find, 
and shake the [[goddess]] from their alter'd [[mind]]. 
not so the raging fires [[fire]] their fury cease, 
but, lurking in the seams, with seeming [[peace]], 
work on their way amid the smold'ring tow, 
sure in destruction, but in motion slow. 
the silent plague thro' the green timber eats, 
and vomits out a tardy flame by fits. 
down to the keels, and upward to the sails, 
the [[fire]] descends, or mounts, but still prevails; 
nor buckets pour'd, nor [[strength]] of [[human]] hand, 
can the victorious element withstand. 
the pious hero rends his robe, and throws 
to heav'n his hands, and with his hands his vows. 
"o jove," he cried, "if pray'rs can yet have place; 
if thou abhorr'st not all the dardan [[race]]; 
if any spark of [[pity]] still remain; 
if gods are gods, and not invok'd in [[vain]]; 
yet spare the relics of the trojan train! 
yet from the flames our burning vessels [[free]], 
or let thy fury fall alone on me! 
at this devoted head thy thunder throw, 
and send the willing [[sacrifice]] below!" 
scarce had he said, when southern storms arise: 
from pole to pole the forky lightning flies; 
loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain; 
heav'n bellies downward, and descends in rain. 
whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent, 
which, hissing thro' the planks, the flames prevent, 
and stop the fiery pest. four ships alone 
burn to the waist, and for the fleet atone. 
but doubtful thoughts [[thought]] the hero's [[heart]] divide; 
if he should still in sicily reside, 
forgetful of his fates [[fate]], or tempt the main, 
in [[hope]] the promis'd [[italy]] to gain. 
then nautes, old and [[wise]], to whom alone 
the will of heav'n by pallas was foreshown; 
vers'd in portents, experienc'd, and inspir'd 
to tell events, and what the fates [[fate]] requir'd; 
thus while he stood, to neither part inclin'd, 
with cheerful words reliev'd his lab'ring [[mind]]: 
"o goddess-born, resign'd in ev'ry [[state]], 
with patience bear, with prudence push your [[fate]]. 
by suff'ring well, our [[fortune]] we subdue; 
fly when she frowns, and, when she calls, pursue. 
your friend acestes is of trojan [[kind]]; 
to him disclose the secrets of your [[mind]]: 
trust in his hands your old and useless train; 
too num'rous for the ships which yet remain: 
the feeble, old, indulgent of their ease, 
the dames who dread the dangers of the seas, 
with all the dastard crew, who dare not stand 
the shock of [[battle]] with your foes by [[land]]. 
here you may build a [[common]] town for all, 
and, from acestes' name, acesta call." 
the reasons [[reason]], with his friend's [[experience]] join'd, 
encourag'd much, but more disturb'd his [[mind]]. 
't was [[dead]] of night; when to his slumb'ring [[eyes]] 
his father's shade descended from the skies [[sky]], 
and thus he spoke: "o more than vital breath, 
lov'd while i liv'd, and dear ev'n after [[death]]; 
o [[son]], in various toils and troubles toss'd, 
the [[king]] of heav'n employs my careful ghost 
on his commands: the [[god]], who sav'd from [[fire]] 
your flaming fleet, and heard your just [[desire]]. 
the wholesome counsel of your friend receive, 
and here the [[coward]] train and woman leave: 
the chosen [[youth]], and those who nobly dare, 
transport, to tempt the dangers of the [[war]]. 
the stern italians will their [[courage]] try; 
rough are their manners, and their minds [[mind]] are high. 
but first to pluto's palace you shall go, 
and seek my shade among the blest below: 
for not with impious ghosts my [[soul]] remains, 
nor suffers with the damn'd perpetual pains [[pain]], 
but breathes the living air of soft elysian plains. 
the chaste sibylla shall your steps convey, 
and [[blood]] of offer'd victims [[free]] the way. 
there shall you [[know]] what realms the gods assign, 
and learn the fates [[fate]] and fortunes [[fortune]] of your line. 
but now, farewell! i vanish with the night, 
and [[feel]] the blast of heav'n's approaching [[light]]." 
he said, and mix'd with shades, and took his airy flight.

"whither so fast?" the filial [[duty]] cried; 
"and why, ah why, the wish'd embrace denied?" 
he said, and rose; as holy zeal inspires, 
he rakes hot embers, and renews the fires [[fire]]; 
his [[country]] gods and vesta then adores 
with cakes and incense, and their aid implores. 
next, for his [[friends]] and [[royal]] host he sent, 
reveal'd his vision, and the gods' intent, 
with his own [[purpose]]. all, without delay, 
the will of jove, and his desires [[desire]] obey. 
they list with [[women]] each degenerate name, 
who dares not hazard [[life]] for future fame. 
these they cashier: the brave remaining few, 
oars, banks, and cables, half consum'd, renew. 
the [[prince]] designs a [[city]] with the plow; 
the lots their sev'ral tenements allow. 
this part is nam'd from ilium, that from troy, 
and the new [[king]] ascends the [[throne]] with joy; 
a chosen senate from the [[people]] draws; 
appoints the judges [[judge]], and ordains the laws [[law]]. 
then, on the top of eryx, they begin 
a rising temple to the paphian queen. 
anchises, [[last]], is honor'd as a [[god]]; 
a [[priest]] is added, annual gifts bestow'd, 
and groves are planted round his blest abode. 
nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown'd; 
and fumes of incense in the fanes abound. 
then from the south arose a gentle breeze 
that curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas; 
the rising winds a ruffling gale afford, 
and call the merry mariners aboard. 
now loud laments along the shores resound, 
of parting [[friends]] in close embraces bound. 
the trembling [[women]], the degenerate train, 
who shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main, 
ev'n those [[desire]] to sail, and take their share 
of the rough passage and the promis'd [[war]]: 
whom [[good]] [[aeneas]] cheers, and recommends 
to their new master's [[care]] his fearful [[friends]]. 
on eryx's altars three fat calves he lays; 
a lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas; 
then slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs. 
high on the deck the godlike hero stands, 
with olive crown'd, a charger in his hands; 
then cast the reeking entrails in the brine, 
and pour'd the [[sacrifice]] of purple wine. 
fresh gales arise; with [[equal]] strokes they vie, 
and brush the buxom seas, and o'er the billows fly. 
meantime the [[mother]] [[goddess]], full of fears [[fear]], 
to [[neptune]] thus address'd, with tender tears: 
"the [[pride]] of jove's imperious queen, the rage, 
the malice which no suff'rings can assuage, 
compel me to these pray'rs; since neither [[fate]], 
nor [[time]], nor [[pity]], can remove her hate: 
ev'n jove is thwarted by his haughty [[wife]]; 
still vanquish'd, yet she still renews the strife. 
as if 't were little to consume the town 
which aw'd the [[world]], and wore th' imperial [[crown]], 
she prosecutes the ghost of troy with pains [[pain]], 
and gnaws, ev'n to the bones, the [[last]] remains. 
let her the causes of her [[hatred]] tell; 
but you can witness its effects too well. 
you saw the storm she rais'd on libyan floods, 
that mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds; 
when, bribing aeolus, she shook the main, 
and mov'd rebellion in your wat'ry reign. 
with fury she possess'd the dardan dames, 
to burn their fleet with execrable flames, 
and forc'd [[aeneas]], when his ships were lost, 
to leave his foll'wers on a [[foreign]] coast. 
for what remains, your godhead i implore, 
and trust my [[son]] to your protecting pow'r. 
if neither jove's nor fate's decree withstand, 
secure his passage to the latian [[land]]." 
then thus the mighty ruler of the main: 
"what may not [[venus]] [[hope]] from neptune's reign? 
my [[kingdom]] claims your birth; my late defense 
of your indanger'd fleet may claim your confidence. 
nor less by [[land]] than sea my deeds declare 
how much your lov'd [[aeneas]] is my [[care]]. 
thee, xanthus, and thee, simois, i attest. 
your trojan [[troops]] when proud achilles press'd, 
and drove before him headlong on the plain, 
and dash'd against the walls the trembling train; 
when floods were fill'd with bodies [[body]] of the slain; 
when crimson xanthus, doubtful of his way, 
stood up on ridges to behold the sea; 
(new heaps came tumbling in, and chok'd his way;) 
when your [[aeneas]] fought, but fought with odds 
of [[force]] unequal, and unequal gods; 
i spread a cloud before the victor's sight, 
sustain'd the vanquish'd, and secur'd his flight; 
ev'n then secur'd him, when i sought with joy 
the vow'd destruction of ungrateful troy. 
my will's the same: [[fair]] [[goddess]], [[fear]] no more, 
your fleet shall safely gain the latian shore; 
their lives [[life]] are giv'n; one destin'd head alone 
shall perish, and for multitudes atone." 
thus having arm'd with hopes [[hope]] her anxious [[mind]], 
his finny team saturnian [[neptune]] join'd, 
then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws, 
and to the loosen'd reins permits the laws [[law]]. 
high on the waves his azure car he guides; 
its axles thunder, and the sea subsides, 
and the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides. 
the tempests fly before their father's face, 
trains of inferior gods his triumph grace, 
and monster whales before their master play, 
and choirs of tritons crowd the wat'ry way. 
the marshal'd pow'rs in [[equal]] [[troops]] divide 
to [[right]] and left; the gods his [[better]] side 
inclose, and on the worse the nymphs [[nymph]] and nereids ride. 
now smiling [[hope]], with sweet vicissitude, 
within the hero's [[mind]] his joys renew'd. 
he calls to raise the masts, the sheets display; 
the cheerful crew with diligence obey; 
they scud before the wind, and sail in open sea. 
ahead of all the master pilot steers; 
and, as he leads, the following navy veers. 
the steeds of night had travel'd half the [[sky]], 
the drowsy rowers on their benches [[lie]], 
when the soft [[god]] of sleep, with easy flight, 
descends, and draws behind a trail of [[light]]. 
thou, palinurus, art [[arts]] his destin'd prey; 
to thee alone he takes his fatal way. 
dire dreams [[dream]] to thee, and iron sleep, he bears; 
and, lighting on thy prow, the form of phorbas wears. 
then thus the traitor [[god]] began his tale: 
"the winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale; 
the ships, without thy [[care]], securely sail. 
now steal an hour of sweet repose; and i 
will take the rudder and thy room supply." 
to whom the yawning pilot, half asleep: 
"me dost thou bid to trust the treach'rous deep, 
the harlot smiles of her dissembling face, 
and to her [[faith]] commit the trojan [[race]]? 
shall i [[believe]] the siren south again, 
and, oft betray'd, not [[know]] the monster main?" 
he said: his fasten'd hands the rudder keep, 
and, fix'd on heav'n, his [[eyes]] repel invading sleep. 
the [[god]] was wroth, and at his temples threw 
a branch in lethe dipp'd, and drunk with stygian dew: 
the pilot, vanquish'd by the pow'r [[divine]], 
soon clos'd his swimming [[eyes]], and lay supine. 
scarce were his limbs extended at their length, 
the [[god]], insulting with superior [[strength]], 
fell heavy on him, plung'd him in the sea, 
and, with the stern, the rudder tore away. 
headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main, 
cried out for helping hands, but cried in [[vain]]. 
the victor daemon mounts obscure in air, 
while the ship sails without the pilot's [[care]]. 
on neptune's [[faith]] the floating fleet relies; 
but what the [[man]] forsook, the [[god]] supplies, 
and o'er the dang'rous deep secure the navy flies; 
glides by the sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast, 
long infamous for ships and sailors lost, 
and [[white]] with bones. th' impetuous ocean roars, 
and rocks rebellow from the sounding shores. 
the watchful hero [[felt]] the knocks, and found 
the tossing vessel sail'd on shoaly ground. 
sure of his pilot's loss, he takes himself 
the helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf. 
inly he griev'd, and, groaning from the breast, 
deplor'd his [[death]]; and thus his [[pain]] express'd: 
"for [[faith]] repos'd on seas, and on the flatt'ring [[sky]], 
thy naked corpse is doom'd on shores unknown to [[lie]]." 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book vi

he said, and wept; then spread his sails before 
the winds, and reach'd at length the cumaean shore: 
their anchors dropp'd, his crew the vessels moor. 
they turn their heads to sea, their sterns to [[land]], 
and greet with greedy joy th' italian strand. 
some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed; 
some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed, 
or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods, 
or trace thro' valleys the discover'd floods. 
thus, while their sev'ral charges they fulfil, 
the pious [[prince]] ascends the [[sacred]] hill 
where phoebus is ador'd; and seeks the shade 
which hides from sight his venerable maid. 
deep in a cave the sibyl makes abode; 
thence full of [[fate]] returns, and of the [[god]]. 
thro' trivia's grove they walk; and now behold, 
and enter now, the temple roof'd with gold. 
when daedalus, to fly the cretan shore, 
his heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore, 
(the first who sail'd in air,) 't is sung by fame, 
to the cumaean coast at length he came, 
and here alighting, built this costly frame. 
inscrib'd to phoebus, here he hung on high 
the steerage of his wings, that cut the [[sky]]: 
then o'er the lofty gate his art [[arts]] emboss'd 
androgeos' [[death]], and off'rings to his ghost; 
sev'n youths [[youth]] from [[athens]] yearly sent, to meet 
the [[fate]] appointed by revengeful crete. 
and next to those the dreadful urn was plac'd, 
in which the destin'd names by lots were cast: 
the mournful parents stand around in tears, 
and rising crete against their shore appears. 
there too, in living sculpture, might be seen 
the mad affection of the cretan queen; 
then how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye; 
the rushing leap, the doubtful progeny, 
the lower part a beast, a [[man]] above, 
the monument of their polluted [[love]]. 
not far from thence he grav'd the wondrous maze, 
a thousand doors, a thousand winding ways: 
here dwells the monster, hid from [[human]] view, 
not to be found, but by the faithful clew; 
till the [[kind]] artist, mov'd with pious [[grief]], 
lent to the loving maid this [[last]] relief, 
and all those erring paths describ'd so well 
that theseus conquer'd and the monster fell. 
here hapless icarus had found his part, 
had not the father's [[grief]] restrain'd his art [[arts]]. 
he twice assay'd to cast his [[son]] in gold; 
twice from his hands he dropp'd the forming mold. 
all this with wond'ring [[eyes]] [[aeneas]] view'd; 
each varying object his delight renew'd: 
eager to [[read]] the rest- achates came, 
and by his side the mad divining dame, 
the priestess of the [[god]], deiphobe her name. 
"time suffers not," she said, "to feed your [[eyes]] 
with empty pleasures [[pleasure]]; haste the [[sacrifice]]. 
sev'n bullocks, yet unyok'd, for phoebus choose, 
and for diana sev'n unspotted ewes." 
this said, the servants urge the [[sacred]] rites, 
while to the temple she the [[prince]] invites. 
a spacious cave, within its farmost part, 
was hew'd and fashion'd by laborious art [[arts]] 
thro' the hill's hollow sides: before the place, 
a hundred doors a hundred entries grace; 
as many voices issue, and the sound 
of sybil's words as many times [[time]] rebound. 
now to the mouth they come. aloud she cries: 
"this is the [[time]]; enquire your destinies. 
he comes; behold the god!" thus while she said, 
(and shiv'ring at the [[sacred]] entry stay'd,) 
her color chang'd; her face was not the same, 
and hollow groans from her deep spirit came. 
her hair stood up; convulsive rage possess'd 
her trembling limbs, and heav'd her lab'ring breast. 
greater than humankind she seem'd to look, 
and with an accent more than mortal spoke. 
her staring [[eyes]] with sparkling fury roll; 
when all the [[god]] came rushing on her [[soul]]. 
swiftly she turn'd, and, foaming as she spoke: 
"why this delay?" she cried- "the pow'rs invoke! 
thy pray'rs alone can open this abode; 
else [[vain]] are my demands, and dumb the [[god]]." 
she said no more. the trembling trojans hear, 
o'erspread with a damp sweat and holy [[fear]]. 
the [[prince]] himself, with awful dread possess'd, 
his vows to [[great]] [[apollo]] thus address'd: 
"indulgent [[god]], propitious pow'r to troy, 
swift to relieve, unwilling to [[destroy]], 
directed by whose hand the dardan dart 
pierc'd the proud grecian's only mortal part: 
thus far, by fate's decrees and thy commands, 
thro' ambient seas and thro' devouring sands, 
our exil'd crew has sought th' ausonian ground; 
and now, at length, the flying coast is found. 
thus far the [[fate]] of troy, from place to place, 
with fury has pursued her wand'ring [[race]]. 
here cease, ye pow'rs, and let your vengeance end: 
troy is no more, and can no more offend. 
and thou, o [[sacred]] maid, inspir'd to see 
th' event of things in dark futurity; 
give me what heav'n has promis'd to my [[fate]], 
to conquer and command the latian [[state]]; 
to fix my wand'ring gods, and find a place 
for the long exiles of the trojan [[race]]. 
then shall my grateful hands a temple rear 
to the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray'r; 
and annual rites, and festivals, and games, 
shall be perform'd to their auspicious names. 
nor shalt thou want thy honors in my [[land]]; 
for there thy faithful oracles shall stand, 
preserv'd in shrines; and ev'ry [[sacred]] lay, 
which, by thy mouth, [[apollo]] shall convey: 
all shall be treasur'd by a chosen train 
of holy priests [[priest]], and ever shall remain. 
but o! commit not thy prophetic [[mind]] 
to flitting leaves, the [[sport]] of ev'ry wind, 
lest they disperse in air our empty [[fate]]; 
write not, but, what the pow'rs ordain, relate." 
struggling in [[vain]], impatient of her load, 
and lab'ring underneath the pond'rous [[god]], 
the more she strove to shake him from her breast, 
with more and far superior [[force]] he press'd; 
commands his entrance, and, without control, 
usurps her organs and inspires her [[soul]]. 
now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors 
ope of themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars 
within the cave, and sibyl's voice restores: 
"escap'd the dangers of the wat'ry reign, 
yet more and greater ills by [[land]] remain. 
the coast, so long desir'd (nor [[doubt]] th' event), 
thy [[troops]] shall reach, but, having reach'd, repent. 
wars, horrid wars [[war]], i view- a field of [[blood]], 
and tiber rolling with a purple flood. 
simois nor xanthus shall be wanting there: 
a new achilles shall in arms appear, 
and he, too, goddess-born. fierce juno's hate, 
added to hostile [[force]], shall urge thy [[fate]]. 
to what [[strange]] nations shalt not thou resort, 
driv'n to solicit aid at ev'ry court! 
the cause the same which ilium once oppress'd; 
a [[foreign]] mistress, and a [[foreign]] guest. 
but thou, secure of [[soul]], unbent with woes, 
the more thy [[fortune]] frowns, the more oppose. 
the dawnings of thy safety shall be shown 
from whence thou least shalt [[hope]], a grecian town." 
thus, from the dark recess, the sibyl spoke, 
and the resisting air the thunder broke; 
the cave rebellow'd, and the temple shook. 
th' ambiguous [[god]], who rul'd her lab'ring breast, 
in these mysterious words his [[mind]] express'd; 
some truths [[truth]] reveal'd, in terms involv'd the rest. 
at length her fury fell, her foaming ceas'd, 
and, ebbing in her [[soul]], the [[god]] decreas'd. 
then thus the [[chief]]: "no terror to my view, 
no frightful face of danger can be new. 
inur'd to suffer, and resolv'd to dare, 
the fates [[fate]], without my pow'r, shall be without my [[care]]. 
this let me crave, since near your grove the road 
to hell lies [[lie]] open, and the dark abode 
which acheron surrounds, th' innavigable flood; 
conduct me thro' the regions void of [[light]], 
and lead me longing to my father's sight. 
for him, a thousand dangers i have sought, 
and, rushing where the thickest grecians fought, 
safe on my back the [[sacred]] burthen brought. 
he, for my sake, the raging ocean tried, 
and wrath of heav'n, my still auspicious guide, 
and bore beyond the [[strength]] decrepid [[age]] supplied. 
oft, since he breath'd his [[last]], in [[dead]] of night 
his reverend image stood before my sight; 
enjoin'd to seek, below, his holy shade; 
conducted there by your unerring aid. 
but you, if pious minds [[mind]] by pray'rs are won, 
oblige the [[father]], and [[protect]] the [[son]]. 
yours is the pow'r; nor proserpine in [[vain]] 
has made you priestess of her nightly reign. 
if orpheus, arm'd with his enchanting lyre, 
the ruthless [[king]] with [[pity]] could inspire, 
and from the shades below redeem his [[wife]]; 
if pollux, off'ring his alternate [[life]], 
could [[free]] his [[brother]], and can daily go 
by turns aloft, by turns descend below- 
why name i theseus, or his greater friend, 
who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend? 
not less than theirs from jove my lineage came; 
my [[mother]] greater, my descent the same." 
so pray'd the trojan [[prince]], and, while he pray'd, 
his hand upon the holy altar laid. 
then thus replied the prophetess [[divine]]: 
"o goddess-born of [[great]] anchises' line, 
the gates of hell are open night and day; 
smooth the descent, and easy is the way: 
but to return, and view the cheerful skies [[sky]], 
in this the task and mighty labor lies [[lie]]. 
to few [[great]] [[jupiter]] imparts this grace, 
and those of shining worth and heav'nly [[race]]. 
betwixt those regions and our upper [[light]], 
deep forests and impenetrable night 
possess the middle space: th' infernal bounds 
cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds. 
but if so dire a [[love]] your [[soul]] invades, 
as twice below to view the trembling shades; 
if you so hard a toil will undertake, 
as twice to pass th' innavigable lake; 
receive my counsel. in the neighb'ring grove 
there stands a tree; the queen of stygian jove 
claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night 
conceal the [[happy]] plant from [[human]] sight. 
one bough it bears; but (wondrous to behold!) 
the ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold: 
this from the vulgar branches must be torn, 
and to [[fair]] proserpine the [[present]] borne, 
ere leave be giv'n to tempt the nether skies [[sky]]. 
the first thus rent a second will arise, 
and the same metal the same room supplies. 
look round the wood, with lifted [[eyes]], to see 
the lurking gold upon the fatal tree: 
then rend it off, as holy rites command; 
the willing metal will obey thy hand, 
following with ease, if favor'd by thy [[fate]], 
thou art [[arts]] foredoom'd to view the stygian [[state]]: 
if not, no labor can the tree constrain; 
and [[strength]] of stubborn arms and steel are [[vain]]. 
besides, you [[know]] not, while you here attend, 
th' unworthy [[fate]] of your unhappy friend: 
breathless he lies [[lie]]; and his unburied ghost, 
depriv'd of fun'ral rites, pollutes your host. 
pay first his pious dues; and, for the [[dead]], 
two sable sheep around his hearse be [[led]]; 
then, living turfs upon his [[body]] lay: 
this done, securely take the destin'd way, 
to find the regions destitute of day." 
she said, and held her [[peace]]. [[aeneas]] went 
sad from the cave, and full of discontent, 
unknowing whom the [[sacred]] sibyl meant. 
achates, the companion of his breast, 
goes grieving by his side, with [[equal]] cares [[care]] oppress'd. 
walking, they talk'd, and fruitlessly divin'd 
what friend the priestess by those words design'd. 
but soon they found an object to deplore: 
misenus lay extended the shore; 
son of the [[god]] of winds: none so renown'd 
the warrior trumpet in the field to sound; 
with breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms, 
and rouse to dare their [[fate]] in honorable arms. 
he serv'd [[great]] [[hector]], and was ever near, 
not with his trumpet only, but his spear. 
but by pelides' arms when [[hector]] fell, 
he chose [[aeneas]]; and he chose as well. 
swoln with applause, and aiming still at more, 
he now provokes the sea gods from the shore; 
with envy triton heard the martial sound, 
and the bold champion, for his challenge, drown'd; 
then cast his mangled carcass on the strand: 
the gazing crowd around the [[body]] stand. 
all weep; but most [[aeneas]] mourns his [[fate]], 
and hastens to perform the [[funeral]] [[state]]. 
in altar-wise, a stately pile they rear; 
the basis broad below, and top advanc'd in air. 
an ancient wood, fit for the [[work]] design'd, 
(the shady covert of the salvage [[kind]],) 
the trojans found: the sounding ax is plied; 
firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow'ring [[pride]] 
of forest ashes, [[feel]] the fatal stroke, 
and piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak. 
huge trunks of trees, fell'd from the steepy [[crown]] 
of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down. 
arm'd like the rest the trojan [[prince]] appears, 
and by his pious labor urges theirs. 
thus while he wrought, revolving in his [[mind]] 
the ways to compass what his [[wish]] design'd, 
he cast his [[eyes]] upon the gloomy grove, 
and then with vows implor'd the queen of [[love]]: 
"o may thy pow'r, propitious still to me, 
conduct my steps to find the fatal tree, 
in this deep forest; since the sibyl's breath 
foretold, alas! too true, misenus' [[death]]." 
scarce had he said, when, full before his sight, 
two doves, descending from their airy flight, 
secure upon the grassy plain alight. 
he knew his mother's birds; and thus he pray'd: 
"be you my guides, with your auspicious aid, 
and lead my footsteps, till the branch be found, 
whose glitt'ring shadow gilds the [[sacred]] ground. 
and thou, [[great]] parent, with celestial [[care]], 
in this distress be [[present]] to my pray'r!" 
thus having said, he stopp'd with watchful sight, 
observing still the motions of their flight, 
what course they took, what [[happy]] signs they shew. 
they fed, and, flutt'ring, by degrees [[degree]] withdrew 
still farther from the place, but still in view: 
hopping and flying, thus they [[led]] him on 
to the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun 
they wing'd their flight aloft; then, stooping low, 
perch'd on the double tree that bears the golden bough. 
thro' the green leafs the glitt'ring shadows glow; 
as, on the [[sacred]] oak, the wintry mistletoe, 
where the proud [[mother]] views her precious brood, 
and happier branches, which she never sow'd. 
such was the glitt'ring; such the ruddy rind, 
and dancing leaves, that wanton'd in the wind. 
he seiz'd the shining bough with griping hold, 
and rent away, with ease, the ling'ring gold; 
then to the sibyl's palace bore the prize. 
meantime the trojan [[troops]], with weeping [[eyes]], 
to [[dead]] misenus [[pay]] his obsequies. 
first, from the ground a lofty pile they rear, 
of pitch trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir: 
the fabric's front with cypress twigs they strew, 
and stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew. 
the topmost part his glitt'ring arms adorn; 
warm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne, 
are pour'd to wash his [[body]], joint by joint, 
and fragrant oils the stiffen'd limbs anoint. 
with groans and cries misenus they deplore: 
then on a bier, with purple cover'd o'er, 
the breathless [[body]], thus bewail'd, they lay, 
and [[fire]] the pile, their faces turn'd away- 
such reverend rites their fathers [[father]] us'd to [[pay]]. 
pure [[oil]] and incense on the [[fire]] they throw, 
and fat of victims, which his [[friends]] bestow. 
these gifts the greedy flames to dust devour; 
then on the living coals red wine they pour; 
and, [[last]], the relics by themselves dispose, 
which in a brazen urn the priests [[priest]] inclose. 
old corynaeus compass'd thrice the crew, 
and dipp'd an olive branch in holy dew; 
which thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud 
invok'd the [[dead]], and then dismissed the crowd. 
but [[good]] [[aeneas]] order'd on the shore 
a stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore, 
a soldier's fauchion, and a seaman's oar. 
thus was his friend interr'd; and deathless fame 
still to the lofty cape consigns his name. 
these rites perform'd, the [[prince]], without delay, 
hastes to the nether [[world]] his destin'd way. 
deep was the cave; and, downward as it went 
from the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent; 
and here th' access a gloomy grove defends, 
and there th' unnavigable lake extends, 
o'er whose unhappy waters, void of [[light]], 
no bird presumes to steer his airy flight; 
such deadly stenches from the depths arise, 
and steaming sulphur, that infects the skies [[sky]]. 
from hence the grecian bards their legends make, 
and give the name avernus to the lake. 
four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught, 
for [[sacrifice]] the pious hero brought. 
the priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns; 
then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns, 
invoking hecate hither to repair: 
a pow'rful name in hell and upper air. 
the [[sacred]] priests [[priest]] with ready knives bereave 
the beasts of [[life]], and in full bowls receive 
the streaming [[blood]]: a lamb to hell and night 
(the sable wool without a streak of white) 
aeneas offers; and, by fate's decree, 
a barren heifer, proserpine, to thee, 
with holocausts he pluto's altar fills; 
sev'n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills; 
then on the broiling entrails [[oil]] he pours; 
which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours. 
late the nocturnal [[sacrifice]] begun, 
nor ended till the next returning sun. 
then [[earth]] began to bellow, trees to dance, 
and howling dogs in glimm'ring [[light]] advance, 
ere hecate came. "far hence be souls [[soul]] profane!" 
the sibyl cried, "and from the grove abstain! 
now, trojan, take the way thy fates [[fate]] afford; 
assume thy [[courage]], and unsheathe thy [[sword]]." 
she said, and pass'd along the gloomy space; 
the [[prince]] pursued her steps with [[equal]] pace. 
ye realms, yet unreveal'd to [[human]] sight, 
ye gods who [[rule]] the regions of the night, 
ye gliding ghosts, permit me to relate 
the mystic wonders of your silent state! 
obscure they went thro' dreary shades, that [[led]] 
along the waste dominions of the [[dead]]. 
thus wander travelers in woods by night, 
by the moon's doubtful and malignant [[light]], 
when jove in dusky clouds involves the skies [[sky]], 
and the faint crescent shoots by fits before their [[eyes]].

just in the gate and in the jaws of hell, 
revengeful cares [[care]] and sullen sorrows [[sorrow]] dwell, 
and pale diseases, and repining [[age]], 
want, [[fear]], and famine's unresisted rage; 
here toils, and [[death]], and death's half-brother, sleep, 
forms terrible to view, their sentry keep; 
with anxious pleasures [[pleasure]] of a guilty [[mind]], 
deep frauds before, and open [[force]] behind; 
the furies' iron beds; and strife, that shakes 
her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes. 
full in the midst of this infernal road, 
an elm displays her dusky arms abroad: 
the [[god]] of sleep there hides his heavy head, 
and empty dreams [[dream]] on ev'ry leaf are spread. 
of various forms unnumber'd specters more, 
centaurs, and double shapes, besiege the door. 
before the passage, horrid hydra stands, 
and briareus with all his hundred hands; 
gorgons, geryon with his triple frame; 
and [[vain]] chimaera vomits empty flame. 
the [[chief]] unsheath'd his shining steel, prepar'd, 
tho' seiz'd with sudden [[fear]], to [[force]] the guard, 
off'ring his brandish'd weapon at their face; 
had not the sibyl stopp'd his eager pace, 
and told him what those empty phantoms were: 
forms without bodies [[body]], and impassive air. 
hence to deep acheron they take their way, 
whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay, 
are whirl'd aloft, and in cocytus lost. 
there charon stands, who rules [[rule]] the dreary coast- 
a sordid [[god]]: down from his hoary chin 
a length of beard descends, uncomb'd, unclean; 
his [[eyes]], like hollow furnaces on [[fire]]; 
a girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire. 
he spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers; 
the freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears.

he look'd in years; yet in his years were seen 
a youthful vigor and autumnal green. 
an airy crowd came rushing where he stood, 
which fill'd the margin of the fatal flood: 
husbands and wives [[wife]], boys and unmarried maids, 
and mighty heroes' more majestic shades, 
and youths [[youth]], intomb'd before their fathers' [[eyes]], 
with hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries. 
thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods, 
or fowls, by winter forc'd, forsake the floods, 
and wing their hasty flight to happier lands [[land]]; 
such, and so thick, the shiv'ring [[army]] stands, 
and press for passage with extended hands. 
now these, now those, the surly boatman bore: 
the rest he drove to distance from the shore. 
the hero, who beheld with wond'ring [[eyes]] 
the tumult mix'd with shrieks, laments, and cries, 
ask'd of his guide, what the rude concourse meant; 
why to the shore the thronging [[people]] bent; 
what forms of [[law]] among the ghosts were us'd; 
why some were ferried o'er, and some refus'd. 
"son of anchises, offspring of the gods," 
the sibyl said, "you see the stygian floods, 
the [[sacred]] stream which heav'n's imperial [[state]] 
attests in oaths, and fears [[fear]] to violate. 
the ghosts rejected are th' unhappy crew 
depriv'd of sepulchers and fun'ral due: 
the boatman, charon; those, the buried host, 
he ferries over to the farther coast; 
nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves 
with such whose bones are not compos'd in graves. 
a hundred years they wander on the shore; 
at length, their penance done, are wafted o'er." 
the trojan [[chief]] his forward pace repress'd, 
revolving anxious thoughts [[thought]] within his breast, 
he saw his [[friends]], who, whelm'd beneath the waves, 
their fun'ral honors claim'd, and ask'd their quiet graves.

the lost leucaspis in the crowd he knew, 
and the brave leader of the lycian crew, 
whom, on the tyrrhene seas, the tempests met; 
the sailors master'd, and the ship o'erset. 
amidst the spirits, palinurus press'd, 
yet fresh from [[life]], a new-admitted guest, 
who, while he steering view'd the stars, and bore 
his course from afric to the latian shore, 
fell headlong down. the trojan fix'd his view, 
and scarcely thro' the gloom the sullen shadow knew. 
then thus the [[prince]]: "what envious pow'r, o friend, 
brought your lov'd [[life]] to this disastrous end? 
for phoebus, ever true in all he said, 
has in your [[fate]] alone my [[faith]] betray'd. 
the [[god]] foretold you should not [[die]], before 
you reach'd, secure from seas, th' italian shore. 
is this th' unerring pow'r?" the ghost replied; 
"nor phoebus flatter'd, nor his answers [[answer]] lied; 
nor envious gods have sent me to the deep: 
but, while the stars and course of heav'n i keep, 
my wearied [[eyes]] were seiz'd with fatal sleep. 
i fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrain'd 
was drawn along, which yet my gripe retain'd. 
now by the winds and raging waves i swear, 
your safety, more than mine, was then my [[care]]; 
lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost, 
your ship should run against the rocky coast. 
three blust'ring nights, borne by the southern blast, 
i floated, and discover'd [[land]] at [[last]]: 
high on a mounting wave my head i bore, 
forcing my [[strength]], and gath'ring to the shore. 
panting, but [[past]] the danger, now i seiz'd 
the craggy cliffs, and my tir'd members eas'd. 
while, cumber'd with my dropping clothes, i lay, 
the cruel nation, covetous of prey, 
stain'd with my [[blood]] th' unhospitable coast; 
and now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are toss'd:

which o avert, by yon ethereal [[light]], 
which i have lost for this eternal night! 
or, if by dearer ties you may be won, 
by your [[dead]] sire, and by your living [[son]], 
redeem from this reproach my wand'ring ghost; 
or with your navy seek the velin coast, 
and in a peaceful grave my corpse compose; 
or, if a nearer way your [[mother]] shows, 
without whose aid you durst not undertake 
this frightful passage o'er the stygian lake, 
lend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o'er 
to the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore." 
scarce had he said, the prophetess began: 
"what hopes [[hope]] delude thee, miserable [[man]]? 
think'st thou, thus unintomb'd, to cross the floods, 
to view the furies and infernal gods, 
and visit, without leave, the dark abodes? 
attend the term of long revolving years; 
fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears. 
this comfort of thy dire misfortune take: 
the wrath of heav'n, inflicted for thy sake, 
with vengeance shall pursue th' inhuman coast, 
till they propitiate thy offended ghost, 
and raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray'r; 
and palinurus' name the place shall bear." 
this calm'd his cares [[care]]; sooth'd with his future fame, 
and pleas'd to hear his propagated name. 
now nearer to the stygian lake they draw: 
whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw; 
observ'd their passage thro' the shady wood, 
and mark'd their near approaches to the flood. 
then thus he call'd aloud, inflam'd with wrath: 
"mortal, whate'er, who this forbidden path 
in arms presum'st to tread, i charge thee, stand, 
and tell thy name, and bus'ness in the [[land]]. 
know this, the realm of night- the stygian shore: 
my boat conveys no living bodies [[body]] o'er; 
nor was i pleas'd [[great]] theseus once to bear, 
who forc'd a passage with his pointed spear, 
nor [[strong]] alcides- [[men]] of mighty fame, 
and from th' [[immortal]] gods their lineage came. 
in fetters one the barking porter tied, 
and took him trembling from his sov'reign's side: 
two sought by [[force]] to seize his beauteous bride." 
to whom the sibyl thus: "compose thy [[mind]]; 
nor frauds are here contriv'd, nor [[force]] design'd. 
still may the dog the wand'ring [[troops]] constrain 
of airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train, 
and with her grisly [[lord]] his lovely queen remain. 
the trojan [[chief]], whose lineage is from jove, 
much fam'd for arms, and more for filial [[love]], 
is sent to seek his sire in your elysian grove. 
if neither piety, nor heav'n's command, 
can gain his passage to the stygian strand, 
this fatal [[present]] shall prevail at least." 
then shew'd the shining bough, conceal'd within her vest.

no more was needful: for the gloomy [[god]] 
stood mute with awe, to see the golden rod; 
admir'd the destin'd off'ring to his queen- 
a venerable gift, so rarely seen. 
his fury thus appeas'd, he puts to [[land]]; 
the ghosts forsake their seats at his command: 
he clears the deck, receives the mighty freight; 
the leaky vessel groans beneath the weight. 
slowly she sails, and scarcely stems the tides; 
the pressing water pours within her sides. 
his passengers at length are wafted o'er, 
expos'd, in muddy weeds, upon the miry shore. 
no sooner landed, in his den they found 
the triple porter of the stygian sound, 
grim cerberus, who soon began to rear 
his crested snakes, and arm'd his bristling hair. 
the prudent sibyl had before prepar'd 
a sop, in honey steep'd, to charm the guard; 
which, mix'd with pow'rful drugs, she cast before 
his greedy grinning jaws, just op'd to roar. 
with three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight, 
with [[hunger]] press'd, devours the pleasing bait. 
long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave; 
he reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave. 
the keeper charm'd, the [[chief]] without delay 
pass'd on, and took th' irremeable way. 
before the gates, the cries of babes new born, 
whom [[fate]] had from their tender mothers [[mother]] torn, 
assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws [[law]] 
condemn'd to [[die]], when traitors judg'd their cause. 
nor want they lots, nor judges [[judge]] to review 
the wrongful sentence, and award a new. 
minos, the strict inquisitor, appears; 
and lives [[life]] and crimes, with his assessors, hears. 
round in his urn the blended balls he rolls, 
absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls [[soul]]. 
the next, in place and [[punishment]], are they 
who prodigally throw their souls [[soul]] away; 
fools, who, repining at their wretched [[state]], 
and loathing anxious [[life]], suborn'd their [[fate]]. 
with late repentance now they would retrieve 
the bodies [[body]] they forsook, and [[wish]] to [[live]]; 
their pains [[pain]] and [[poverty]] [[desire]] to bear, 
to view the [[light]] of heav'n, and breathe the vital air: 
but [[fate]] forbids; the stygian floods oppose, 
and with circling streams the captive souls [[soul]] inclose. 
not far from thence, the mournful fields appear 
so call'd from lovers that inhabit there. 
the souls [[soul]] whom that unhappy flame invades, 
in secret solitude and myrtle shades 
make endless moans, and, pining with [[desire]], 
lament too late their unextinguish'd [[fire]]. 
here procris, eriphyle here he found, 
baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound 
made by her [[son]]. he saw pasiphae there, 
with phaedra's ghost, a foul incestuous pair. 
there laodamia, with evadne, moves, 
unhappy both, but [[loyal]] in their loves [[love]]: 
caeneus, a woman once, and once a [[man]], 
but ending in the [[sex]] she first began. 
not far from these phoenician dido stood, 
fresh from her wound, her bosom bath'd in [[blood]]; 
whom when the trojan hero hardly knew, 
obscure in shades, and with a doubtful view, 
(doubtful as he who sees, thro' dusky night, 
or thinks [[think]] he sees, the moon's uncertain [[light]],) 
with tears he first approach'd the sullen shade; 
and, as his [[love]] inspir'd him, thus he said: 
"unhappy queen! then is the [[common]] breath 
of rumor true, in your reported [[death]], 
and i, alas! the cause? by heav'n, i vow, 
and all the pow'rs that [[rule]] the realms below, 
unwilling i forsook your friendly [[state]], 
commanded by the gods, and forc'd by fate- 
those gods, that [[fate]], whose unresisted might 
have sent me to these regions void of [[light]], 
thro' the vast [[empire]] of eternal night. 
nor dar'd i to presume, that, press'd with [[grief]], 
my flight should urge you to this dire relief. 
stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows: 
't is the [[last]] interview that [[fate]] allows!" 
in [[vain]] he thus attempts her [[mind]] to move 
with tears, and pray'rs, and late-repenting [[love]]. 
disdainfully she look'd; then turning round, 
but fix'd her [[eyes]] unmov'd upon the ground, 
and what he says and swears, regards no more 
than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar; 
but whirl'd away, to shun his hateful sight, 
hid in the forest and the shades of night; 
then sought sichaeus thro' the shady grove, 
who answer'd all her cares [[care]], and equal'd all her [[love]]. 
some pious tears the pitying hero paid, 
and follow'd with his [[eyes]] the flitting shade, 
then took the forward way, by [[fate]] ordain'd, 
and, with his guide, the farther fields attain'd, 
where, sever'd from the rest, the warrior souls [[soul]] remain'd.

tydeus he met, with meleager's [[race]], 
the [[pride]] of armies [[army]], and the soldiers' grace; 
and pale adrastus with his ghastly face. 
of trojan chiefs [[chief]] he view'd a num'rous train, 
all much lamented, all in [[battle]] slain; 
glaucus and medon, high above the rest, 
antenor's sons [[son]], and ceres' [[sacred]] [[priest]]. 
and proud idaeus, priam's charioteer, 
who shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear. 
the gladsome ghosts, in circling [[troops]], attend 
and with unwearied [[eyes]] behold their friend; 
delight to hover near, and long to [[know]] 
what bus'ness brought him to the realms below. 
but argive chiefs [[chief]], and agamemnon's train, 
when his refulgent arms flash'd thro' the shady plain, 
fled from his well-known face, with wonted [[fear]], 
as when his thund'ring [[sword]] and pointed spear 
drove headlong to their ships, and glean'd the routed rear.

they rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes; 
but the [[weak]] voice deceiv'd their gasping throats. 
here priam's [[son]], deiphobus, he found, 
whose face and limbs were one continued wound: 
dishonest, with lopp'd arms, the [[youth]] appears, 
spoil'd of his nose, and shorten'd of his ears. 
he scarcely knew him, striving to disown 
his blotted form, and blushing to be known; 
and therefore first began: "o tsucer's [[race]], 
who durst thy faultless figure thus deface? 
what [[heart]] could [[wish]], what hand inflict, this dire disgrace?

'twas fam'd, that in our [[last]] and fatal night 
your [[single]] prowess long sustain'd the [[fight]], 
till tir'd, not forc'd, a glorious [[fate]] you chose, 
and fell upon a heap of slaughter'd foes. 
but, in remembrance of so brave a deed, 
a tomb and fun'ral honors i decreed; 
thrice call'd your manes on the trojan plains: 
the place your armor and your name retains. 
your [[body]] too i sought, and, had i found, 
design'd for burial in your native ground." 
the ghost replied: "your piety has paid 
all needful rites, to rest my wand'ring shade; 
but cruel [[fate]], and my more cruel [[wife]], 
to grecian swords [[sword]] betray'd my sleeping [[life]]. 
these are the monuments of helen's [[love]]: 
the shame i bear below, the marks i bore above. 
you [[know]] in what deluding joys we pass'd 
the night that was by heav'n decreed our [[last]]: 
for, when the fatal horse, descending down, 
pregnant with arms, o'erwhelm'd th' unhappy town 
she feign'd nocturnal orgies; left my bed, 
and, mix'd with trojan dames, the dances [[led]] 
then, waving high her torch, the signal made, 
which rous'd the grecians from their ambuscade. 
with watching overworn, with cares [[care]] oppress'd, 
unhappy i had laid me down to rest, 
and heavy sleep my weary limbs possess'd. 
meantime my worthy [[wife]] our arms mislaid, 
and from beneath my head my [[sword]] convey'd; 
the door unlatch'd, and, with repeated calls, 
invites her former [[lord]] within my walls. 
thus in her crime her confidence she plac'd, 
and with new treasons would redeem the [[past]]. 
what need i more? into the room they ran, 
and meanly murther'd a defenseless [[man]]. 
ulysses, basely born, first [[led]] the way. 
avenging pow'rs! with [[justice]] if i [[pray]], 
that [[fortune]] be their own another day! 
but [[answer]] you; and in your turn relate, 
what brought you, living, to the stygian [[state]]: 
driv'n by the winds and errors of the sea, 
or did you heav'n's superior doom obey? 
or tell what other [[chance]] conducts your way, 
to view with mortal [[eyes]] our dark retreats, 
tumults and torments of th' infernal seats." 
while thus in talk the flying hours they pass, 
the sun had finish'd more than half his [[race]]: 
and they, perhaps, in words and tears had spent 
the little [[time]] of stay which heav'n had lent; 
but thus the sibyl chides their long delay: 
"night rushes down, and headlong drives the day: 
't is here, in different paths, the way divides; 
the [[right]] to pluto's golden palace guides; 
the left to that unhappy region tends, 
which to the depth of tartarus descends; 
the seat of night profound, and punish'd fiends." 
then thus deiphobus: "o [[sacred]] maid, 
forbear to chide, and be your will obey'd! 
lo! to the secret shadows i retire, 
to [[pay]] my penance till my years expire. 
proceed, auspicious [[prince]], with [[glory]] crown'd, 
and born to [[better]] fates [[fate]] than i have found." 
he said; and, while he said, his steps he turn'd 
to secret shadows, and in [[silence]] mourn'd. 
the hero, looking on the left, espied 
a lofty tow'r, and [[strong]] on ev'ry side 
with treble walls, which phlegethon surrounds, 
whose fiery flood the burning [[empire]] bounds; 
and, press'd betwixt the rocks, the bellowing noise resounds

wide is the fronting gate, and, rais'd on high 
with adamantine columns, threats the [[sky]]. 
vain is the [[force]] of [[man]], and heav'n's as [[vain]], 
to crush the pillars which the pile sustain. 
sublime on these a tow'r of steel is rear'd; 
and dire tisiphone there keeps the ward, 
girt in her sanguine gown, by night and day, 
observant of the souls [[soul]] that pass the downward way. 
from hence are heard the groans of ghosts, the pains [[pain]] 
of sounding lashes and of dragging chains. 
the trojan stood astonish'd at their cries, 
and ask'd his guide from whence those yells arise; 
and what the crimes, and what the tortures were, 
and loud laments that rent the liquid air. 
she thus replied: "the chaste and holy [[race]] 
are all forbidden this polluted place. 
but hecate, when she gave to [[rule]] the woods, 
then [[led]] me trembling thro' these dire abodes, 
and taught the tortures of th' avenging gods. 
these are the realms of unrelenting [[fate]]; 
and awful rhadamanthus rules [[rule]] the [[state]]. 
he hears and judges [[judge]] each committed crime; 
enquires into the manner, place, and [[time]]. 
the conscious wretch must all his acts reveal, 
(loth to confess, unable to conceal), 
from the first moment of his vital breath, 
to his [[last]] hour of unrepenting [[death]]. 
straight, o'er the guilty ghost, the fury shakes 
the sounding whip and brandishes her snakes, 
and the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes. 
then, of itself, unfolds th' eternal door; 
with dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar. 
you see, before the gate, what stalking ghost 
commands the guard, what sentries keep the post. 
more formidable hydra stands within, 
whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin. 
the gaping gulf low to the center lies [[lie]], 
and twice as deep as [[earth]] is distant from the skies [[sky]]. 
the rivals of the gods, the titan [[race]], 
here, sing'd with lightning, roll within th' unfathom'd space.

here [[lie]] th' alaean twins, (i saw them both,) 
enormous bodies [[body]], of gigantic [[growth]], 
who dar'd in [[fight]] the thund'rer to defy, 
affect his heav'n, and [[force]] him from the [[sky]]. 
salmoneus, suff'ring cruel pains [[pain]], i found, 
for emulating jove; the rattling sound 
of mimic thunder, and the glitt'ring blaze 
of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays. 
thro' elis and the grecian towns he flew; 
th' audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew: 
he wav'd a torch aloft, and, madly [[vain]], 
sought godlike [[worship]] from a servile train. 
ambitious fool! with horny hoofs to pass 
o'er hollow arches of resounding brass, 
to rival thunder in its rapid course, 
and imitate inimitable force! 
but he, the [[king]] of heav'n, obscure on high, 
bar'd his red arm, and, launching from the [[sky]] 
his writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke, 
down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook. 
there tityus was to see, who took his birth 
from heav'n, his nursing from the foodful [[earth]]. 
here his gigantic limbs, with large embrace, 
infold nine acres of infernal space. 
a rav'nous vulture, in his open'd side, 
her crooked beak and cruel talons tried; 
still for the growing liver digg'd his breast; 
the growing liver still supplied the feast; 
still are his entrails fruitful to their pains [[pain]]: 
th' [[immortal]] [[hunger]] lasts, th' [[immortal]] food remains. 
ixion and perithous i could name, 
and more thessalian chiefs [[chief]] of mighty fame. 
high o'er their heads a mold'ring rock is plac'd, 
that promises a fall, and shakes at ev'ry blast. 
they [[lie]] below, on golden beds display'd; 
and genial feasts with regal pomp are made. 
the queen of furies by their sides is set, 
and snatches from their mouths th' untasted meat, 
which if they touch, her hissing snakes she rears, 
tossing her torch, and thund'ring in their ears. 
then they, who brothers' [[better]] claim disown, 
expel their parents, and usurp the [[throne]]; 
defraud their clients, and, to lucre sold, 
sit brooding on unprofitable gold; 
who dare not give, and ev'n refuse to lend 
to their [[poor]] kindred, or a wanting friend. 
vast is the throng of these; nor less the train 
of lustful youths [[youth]], for foul adult'ry slain: 
hosts of deserters, who their [[honor]] sold, 
and basely broke their [[faith]] for bribes of gold. 
all these within the dungeon's depth remain, 
despairing pardon, and expecting [[pain]]. 
ask not what pains [[pain]]; nor farther seek to [[know]] 
their process, or the forms of [[law]] below. 
some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along, 
and bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung

unhappy theseus, doom'd for ever there, 
is fix'd by [[fate]] on his eternal chair; 
and wretched phlegyas warns the [[world]] with cries 
(could warning make the [[world]] more just or wise): 
'learn [[righteousness]], and dread th' avenging deities.' 
to tyrants [[tyrant]] others have their [[country]] sold, 
imposing [[foreign]] lords [[lord]], for [[foreign]] gold; 
some have old laws [[law]] repeal'd, new statutes made, 
not as the [[people]] pleas'd, but as they paid; 
with incest some their daughters' bed profan'd: 
all dar'd the worst of ills, and, what they dar'd, attain'd.

had i a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues, 
and throats of brass, inspir'd with iron lungs, 
i could not half those horrid crimes repeat, 
nor half the punishments [[punishment]] those crimes have met. 
but let us haste our [[voyage]] to pursue: 
the walls of pluto's palace are in view; 
the gate, and iron arch above it, stands 
on anvils labor'd by the cyclops' hands. 
before our farther way the fates [[fate]] allow, 
here must we fix on high the golden bough." 
she said: and thro' the gloomy shades they pass'd, 
and chose the middle path. arriv'd at [[last]], 
the [[prince]] with living water sprinkled o'er 
his limbs and [[body]]; then approach'd the door, 
possess'd the porch, and on the front above 
he fix'd the fatal bough requir'd by pluto's [[love]]. 
these holy rites perform'd, they took their way 
where long extended plains of [[pleasure]] lay: 
the verdant fields with those of heav'n may vie, 
with ether vested, and a purple [[sky]]; 
the blissful seats of [[happy]] souls [[soul]] below. 
stars of their own, and their own suns, they [[know]]; 
their airy limbs in sports [[sport]] they exercise, 
and on the green contend the wrestler's prize. 
some in heroic verse divinely sing; 
others in artful measures [[led]] the ring. 
the thracian bard, surrounded by the rest, 
there stands conspicuous in his flowing vest; 
his flying fingers, and harmonious quill, 
strikes sev'n distinguish'd notes, and sev'n at once they fill.

here found they tsucer's old heroic [[race]], 
born [[better]] times [[time]] and happier years to grace. 
assaracus and ilus here enjoy 
perpetual fame, with him who founded troy. 
the [[chief]] beheld their chariots from afar, 
their shining arms, and coursers train'd to [[war]]: 
their lances fix'd in [[earth]], their steeds around, 
free from their harness, graze the flow'ry ground. 
the [[love]] of horses which they had, alive, 
and [[care]] of chariots, after [[death]] survive. 
some cheerful souls [[soul]] were feasting on the plain; 
some did the [[song]], and some the choir maintain, 
beneath a laurel shade, where mighty po 
mounts up to woods above, and hides his head below. 
here patriots [[live]], who, for their country's [[good]], 
in fighting fields, were prodigal of [[blood]]: 
priests of unblemish'd lives [[life]] here make abode, 
and poets worthy their inspiring [[god]]; 
and searching wits, of more mechanic parts, 
who grac'd their [[age]] with new-invented [[arts]]: 
those who to worth their bounty did extend, 
and those who knew that bounty to commend. 
the heads of these with holy fillets bound, 
and all their temples were with garlands crown'd. 
to these the sibyl thus her [[speech]] address'd, 
and first to him surrounded by the rest 
(tow'ring his height, and ample was his breast): 
"say, [[happy]] souls [[soul]], [[divine]] musaeus, say, 
where lives [[life]] anchises, and where lies [[lie]] our way 
to find the hero, for whose only sake 
we sought the dark abodes, and cross'd the bitter lake?"

to this the [[sacred]] poet thus replied: 
"in no fix'd place the [[happy]] souls [[soul]] reside. 
in groves we [[live]], and [[lie]] on mossy beds, 
by crystal streams, that murmur thro' the meads: 
but pass yon easy hill, and thence descend; 
the path conducts you to your journey's end." 
this said, he [[led]] them up the mountain's brow, 
and shews them all the shining fields below. 
they wind the hill, and thro' the blissful meadows go. 
but old anchises, in a flow'ry vale, 
review'd his muster'd [[race]], and took the tale: 
those [[happy]] spirits, which, ordain'd by [[fate]], 
for future beings and new bodies [[body]] wait- 
with studious [[thought]] observ'd th' illustrious throng, 
in nature's order as they pass'd along: 
their names, their fates [[fate]], their conduct, and their [[care]],

in peaceful senates and successful [[war]]. 
he, when [[aeneas]] on the plain appears, 
meets him with open arms, and falling tears. 
"welcome," he said, "the gods' undoubted race! 
o long expected to my dear embrace! 
once more 't is giv'n me to behold your face! 
the [[love]] and pious [[duty]] which you [[pay]] 
have pass'd the perils of so hard a way. 
't is true, computing times [[time]], i now believ'd 
the [[happy]] day approach'd; nor are my hopes [[hope]] deceiv'd. 
what length of lands [[land]], what oceans have you pass'd; 
what storms sustain'd, and on what shores been cast? 
how have i fear'd your fate! but fear'd it most, 
when [[love]] assail'd you, on the libyan coast." 
to this, the filial [[duty]] thus replies: 
"your [[sacred]] ghost before my sleeping [[eyes]] 
appear'd, and often urg'd this painful enterprise. 
after long tossing on the tyrrhene sea, 
my navy rides at anchor in the bay. 
but reach your hand, o parent shade, nor shun 
the dear embraces of your longing son!" 
he said; and falling tears his face bedew: 
then thrice around his neck his arms he threw; 
and thrice the flitting shadow slipp'd away, 
like winds, or empty dreams [[dream]] that fly the day. 
now, in a secret vale, the trojan sees 
a sep'rate grove, thro' which a gentle breeze 
plays with a passing breath, and whispers thro' the trees;

and, just before the confines of the wood, 
the gliding lethe leads her silent flood. 
about the boughs an airy nation flew, 
thick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden dew; 
in summer's heat on tops of lilies feed, 
and creep within their bells, to suck the balmy seed: 
the winged [[army]] roams the fields around; 
the rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound. 
aeneas wond'ring stood, then ask'd the cause 
which to the stream the crowding [[people]] draws. 
then thus the sire: "the souls [[soul]] that throng the flood 
are those to whom, by [[fate]], are other bodies [[body]] ow'd: 
in lethe's lake they long oblivion taste, 
of future [[life]] secure, forgetful of the [[past]]. 
long has my [[soul]] desir'd this [[time]] and place, 
to set before your sight your glorious [[race]], 
that this presaging joy may [[fire]] your [[mind]] 
to seek the shores by [[destiny]] design'd."- 
"o [[father]], can it be, that souls [[soul]] sublime 
return to visit our terrestrial clime, 
and that the gen'rous [[mind]], releas'd by [[death]], 
can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath?" 
anchises then, in order, thus begun 
to clear those wonders to his godlike [[son]]: 
"know, first, that heav'n, and earth's compacted frame, 
and flowing waters, and the starry flame, 
and both the radiant lights [[light]], one [[common]] [[soul]] 
inspires and feeds, and animates the whole. 
this active [[mind]], infus'd thro' all the space, 
unites and mingles with the mighty mass. 
hence [[men]] and beasts the breath of [[life]] obtain, 
and birds of air, and monsters of the main. 
th' ethereal vigor is in all the same, 
and every [[soul]] is fill'd with [[equal]] flame; 
as much as earthy limbs, and gross allay 
of mortal members, [[subject]] to decay, 
blunt not the beams of heav'n and edge of day. 
from this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts, 
desire and [[fear]] by turns possess their hearts [[heart]], 
and [[grief]], and joy; nor can the groveling [[mind]], 
in the dark dungeon of the limbs confin'd, 
assert the native skies [[sky]], or own its heav'nly [[kind]]: 
nor [[death]] itself can wholly wash their stains; 
but long-contracted filth ev'n in the [[soul]] remains. 
the relics of inveterate [[vice]] they wear, 
and spots of [[sin]] obscene in ev'ry face appear. 
for this are various penances enjoin'd; 
and some are hung to bleach upon the wind, 
some plung'd in waters, others purg'd in fires [[fire]], 
till all the dregs are drain'd, and all the rust expires.

all have their manes, and those manes bear: 
the few, so cleans'd, to these abodes repair, 
and breathe, in ample fields, the soft elysian air. 
then are they [[happy]], when by length of [[time]] 
the scurf is worn away of each committed crime; 
no speck is left of their habitual stains, 
but the pure ether of the [[soul]] remains. 
but, when a thousand rolling years are [[past]], 
(so long their punishments [[punishment]] and penance [[last]],) 
whole droves of minds [[mind]] are, by the driving [[god]], 
compell'd to drink the deep lethaean flood, 
in large forgetful draughts to steep the cares [[care]] 
of their [[past]] labors, and their irksome years, 
that, unrememb'ring of its former [[pain]], 
the [[soul]] may suffer mortal flesh again." 
thus having said, the [[father]] spirit leads 
the priestess and his [[son]] thro' swarms of shades, 
and takes a rising ground, from thence to see 
the long procession of his progeny. 
"survey," pursued the sire, "this airy throng, 
as, offer'd to thy view, they pass along. 
these are th' italian names, which [[fate]] will join 
with ours, and graff upon the trojan line. 
observe the [[youth]] who first appears in sight, 
and holds the nearest station to the [[light]], 
already seems to snuff the vital air, 
and leans just forward, on a shining spear: 
silvius is he, thy last-begotten [[race]], 
but first in order sent, to fill thy place; 
an alban name, but mix'd with dardan [[blood]], 
born in the covert of a shady wood: 
him [[fair]] lavinia, thy surviving [[wife]], 
shall breed in groves, to lead a solitary [[life]]. 
in alba he shall fix his [[royal]] seat, 
and, born a [[king]], a [[race]] of kings [[king]] beget. 
then procas, [[honor]] of the trojan name, 
capys, and numitor, of endless fame. 
a second silvius after these appears; 
silvius [[aeneas]], for thy name he bears; 
for arms and [[justice]] equally renown'd, 
who, late restor'd, in alba shall be crown'd. 
how [[great]] they look! how vig'rously they wield 
their weighty lances, and sustain the shield! 
but they, who crown'd with oaken wreaths appear, 
shall gabian walls and [[strong]] fidena rear; 
nomentum, bola, with pometia, found; 
and raise collatian tow'rs on rocky ground. 
all these shall then be towns of mighty fame, 
tho' now they [[lie]] obscure, and lands [[land]] without a name. 
see romulus the [[great]], born to restore 
the [[crown]] that once his injur'd grandsire wore. 
this [[prince]] a priestess of your [[blood]] shall bear, 
and like his sire in arms he shall appear. 
two rising crests, his [[royal]] head adorn; 
born from a [[god]], himself to godhead born: 
his sire already signs him for the skies [[sky]], 
and marks the seat amidst the deities. 
auspicious chief! thy [[race]], in times [[time]] to come, 
shall spread the conquests of imperial rome- 
rome, whose ascending tow'rs shall heav'n invade, 
involving [[earth]] and ocean in her shade; 
high as the [[mother]] of the gods in place, 
and proud, like her, of an [[immortal]] [[race]]. 
then, when in pomp she makes the phrygian round, 
with golden turrets on her temples crown'd; 
a hundred gods her sweeping train supply; 
her offspring all, and all command the [[sky]]. 
"now fix your sight, and stand intent, to see 
your roman [[race]], and julian progeny. 
the mighty caesar waits his vital hour, 
impatient for the [[world]], and grasps his promis'd pow'r. 
but next behold the [[youth]] of form [[divine]], 
ceasar himself, exalted in his line; 
augustus, promis'd oft, and long foretold, 
sent to the realm that saturn rul'd of old; 
born to restore a [[better]] [[age]] of gold. 
afric and [[india]] shall his pow'r obey; 
he shall extend his propagated sway 
beyond the solar year, without the starry way, 
where atlas turns the rolling heav'ns around, 
and his broad shoulders with their lights [[light]] are crown'd. 
at his foreseen approach, already quake 
the caspian kingdoms [[kingdom]] and maeotian lake: 
their seers behold the tempest from afar, 
and threat'ning oracles denounce the [[war]]. 
nile hears him knocking at his sev'nfold gates, 
and seeks his hidden spring, and fears [[fear]] his nephew's fates [[fate]].

nor hercules more lands [[land]] or labors knew, 
not tho' the brazen-footed hind he slew, 
freed erymanthus from the foaming boar, 
and dipp'd his arrows in lernaean gore; 
nor bacchus, turning from his [[indian]] [[war]], 
by tigers drawn triumphant in his car, 
from nisus' top descending on the plains, 
with curling vines around his purple reins. 
and [[doubt]] we yet thro' dangers to pursue 
the paths of [[honor]], and a [[crown]] in view? 
but what's the [[man]], who from afar appears? 
his head with olive crown'd, his hand a censer bears, 
his hoary beard and holy vestments bring 
his lost [[idea]] back: i [[know]] the roman [[king]]. 
he shall to peaceful [[rome]] new laws [[law]] ordain, 
call'd from his mean abode a scepter to sustain. 
him tullus next in [[dignity]] succeeds, 
an active [[prince]], and prone to martial deeds. 
he shall his [[troops]] for fighting fields prepare, 
disus'd to toils, and triumphs of the [[war]]. 
by dint of [[sword]] his [[crown]] he shall increase, 
and scour his armor from the rust of [[peace]]. 
whom ancus follows, with a fawning air, 
but [[vain]] within, and proudly popular. 
next view the tarquin kings [[king]], th' avenging [[sword]] 
of brutus, justly drawn, and [[rome]] restor'd. 
he first renews the rods and ax severe, 
and gives the consuls [[royal]] robes to wear. 
his sons [[son]], who seek the [[tyrant]] to sustain, 
and long for arbitrary lords [[lord]] again, 
with ignominy scourg'd, in open sight, 
he dooms to [[death]] deserv'd, asserting [[public]] [[right]]. 
unhappy [[man]], to break the pious laws [[law]] 
of [[nature]], pleading in his children's cause! 
howeer the doubtful [[fact]] is understood, 
't is [[love]] of [[honor]], and his country's [[good]]: 
the consul, not the [[father]], sheds the [[blood]]. 
behold torquatus the same track pursue; 
and, next, the two devoted decii view: 
the drusian line, camillus loaded [[home]] 
with standards well redeem'd, and [[foreign]] foes o'ercome 
the pair you see in [[equal]] armor shine, 
now, [[friends]] below, in close embraces join; 
but, when they leave the shady realms of night, 
and, cloth'd in bodies [[body]], breathe your upper [[light]], 
with mortal hate each other shall pursue: 
what wars [[war]], what wounds, what slaughter shall ensue! 
from alpine heights the [[father]] first descends; 
his daughter's husband in the plain attends: 
his daughter's husband arms his eastern [[friends]]. 
embrace again, my sons [[son]], be foes no more; 
nor stain your [[country]] with her children's gore! 
and thou, the first, lay down thy lawless claim, 
thou, of my [[blood]], who bearist the julian name! 
another comes, who shall in triumph ride, 
and to the capitol his chariot guide, 
from conquer'd corinth, [[rich]] with grecian spoils. 
and yet another, fam'd for warlike toils, 
on argos shall impose the roman laws [[law]], 
and on the greeks [[greek]] [[revenge]] the trojan cause; 
shall drag in chains their achillean [[race]]; 
shall vindicate his ancestors' disgrace, 
and pallas, for her violated place. 
great cato there, for gravity renown'd, 
and conqu'ring cossus goes with laurels crown'd. 
who can omit the gracchi? who declare 
the scipios' worth, those thunderbolts of [[war]], 
the double bane of [[carthage]]? who can see 
without esteem for [[virtuous]] [[poverty]], 
severe fabricius, or can cease t' [[admire]] 
the plowman consul in his coarse attire? 
tir'd as i am, my [[praise]] the fabii claim; 
and thou, [[great]] hero, [[greatest]] of thy name, 
ordain'd in [[war]] to save the sinking [[state]], 
and, by delays, to put a stop to fate! 
let others [[better]] mold the running mass 
of metals, and inform the breathing brass, 
and soften into flesh a marble face; 
plead [[better]] at the bar; describe the skies [[sky]], 
and when the stars descend, and when they rise. 
but, [[rome]], 't is thine alone, with awful sway, 
to [[rule]] [[mankind]], and make the [[world]] obey, 
disposing [[peace]] and [[war]] by thy own majestic way; 
to tame the proud, the fetter'd [[slave]] to [[free]]: 
these are imperial [[arts]], and worthy thee." 
he paus'd; and, while with wond'ring [[eyes]] they view'd 
the passing spirits, thus his [[speech]] renew'd: 
"see [[great]] marcellus! how, untir'd in toils, 
he moves with manly grace, how [[rich]] with regal spoils! 
he, when his [[country]], threaten'd with alarms, 
requires his [[courage]] and his conqu'ring arms, 
shall more than once the punic bands affright; 
shall kill the gaulish [[king]] in [[single]] [[fight]]; 
then to the capitol in triumph move, 
and the third spoils shall grace feretrian jove." 
aeneas here beheld, of form [[divine]], 
a godlike [[youth]] in glitt'ring armor shine, 
with [[great]] marcellus keeping [[equal]] pace; 
but gloomy were his [[eyes]], dejected was his face. 
he saw, and, wond'ring, ask'd his airy guide, 
what and of whence was he, who press'd the hero's side: 
"his [[son]], or one of his illustrious name? 
how like the former, and almost the same! 
observe the crowds that compass him around; 
all gaze, and all [[admire]], and raise a shouting sound: 
but hov'ring mists around his brows are spread, 
and night, with sable shades, involves his head." 
"seek not to [[know]]," the ghost replied with tears, 
"the sorrows [[sorrow]] of thy sons [[son]] in future years. 
this [[youth]] (the blissful vision of a day) 
shall just be shown on [[earth]], and snatch'd away. 
the gods too high had rais'd the roman [[state]], 
were but their gifts as permanent as [[great]]. 
what groans of [[men]] shall fill the martian field! 
how fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield! 
what fun'ral pomp shall floating tiber see, 
when, rising from his bed, he views the [[sad]] solemnity! 
no [[youth]] shall [[equal]] hopes [[hope]] of [[glory]] give, 
no [[youth]] afford so [[great]] a cause to grieve; 
the trojan [[honor]], and the roman boast, 
admir'd when living, and ador'd when lost! 
mirror of ancient [[faith]] in early youth! 
undaunted worth, inviolable truth! 
no foe, unpunish'd, in the fighting field 
shall dare thee, foot to foot, with [[sword]] and shield; 
much less in arms oppose thy matchless [[force]], 
when thy sharp spurs shall urge thy foaming horse. 
ah! couldst thou break thro' fate's severe decree, 
a new marcellus shall arise in thee! 
full canisters of fragrant lilies bring, 
mix'd with the purple roses of the spring; 
let me with fun'ral flow'rs his [[body]] strow; 
this gift which parents to their [[children]] owe, 
this unavailing gift, at least, i may bestow!" 
thus having said, he [[led]] the hero round 
the confines of the blest elysian ground; 
which when anchises to his [[son]] had shown, 
and fir'd his [[mind]] to mount the promis'd [[throne]], 
he tells the future wars [[war]], ordain'd by [[fate]]; 
the [[strength]] and customs of the latian [[state]]; 
the [[prince]], and [[people]]; and forearms his [[care]] 
with rules [[rule]], to push his [[fortune]], or to bear. 
two gates the silent house of sleep adorn; 
of polish'd ivory this, that of transparent horn: 
true visions thro' transparent horn arise; 
thro' polish'd ivory pass deluding lies [[lie]]. 
of various things discoursing as he pass'd, 
anchises hither bends his steps at [[last]]. 
then, thro' the gate of iv'ry, he dismiss'd 
his valiant offspring and divining guest. 
straight to the ships [[aeneas]] his way, 
embark'd his [[men]], and skimm'd along the sea, 
still coasting, till he gain'd cajeta's bay. 
at length on oozy ground his galleys moor; 
their heads are turn'd to sea, their sterns to shore. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book vii

and thou, o matron of [[immortal]] fame, 
here dying, to the shore hast left thy name; 
cajeta still the place is call'd from thee, 
the nurse of [[great]] aeneas' infancy. 
here rest thy bones in [[rich]] hesperia's plains; 
thy name ('t is all a ghost can have) remains. 
now, when the [[prince]] her fun'ral rites had paid, 
he plow'd the tyrrhene seas with sails display'd. 
from [[land]] a gentle breeze arose by night, 
serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright, 
and the sea trembled with her silver [[light]]. 
now near the shelves of circe's shores they run, 
(circe the [[rich]], the [[daughter]] of the sun,) 
a dang'rous coast: the [[goddess]] wastes her days 
in joyous songs [[song]]; the rocks resound her lays: 
in spinning, or the loom, she spends the night, 
and cedar brands supply her father's [[light]]. 
from hence were heard, rebellowing to the main, 
the roars of lions that refuse the chain, 
the grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears, 
and herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears.

these from their caverns, at the close of night, 
fill the [[sad]] isle with [[horror]] and affright. 
darkling they mourn their [[fate]], whom circe's pow'r, 
(that watch'd the moon and planetary hour,) 
with words and wicked herbs from humankind 
had alter'd, and in brutal shapes confin'd. 
which monsters lest the trojans' pious host 
should bear, or touch upon th' inchanted coast, 
propitious [[neptune]] steer'd their course by night 
with rising gales that sped their [[happy]] flight. 
supplied with these, they skim the sounding shore, 
and hear the swelling surges vainly roar. 
now, when the rosy morn began to rise, 
and wav'd her saffron streamer thro' the skies [[sky]]; 
when thetis blush'd in purple not her own, 
and from her face the breathing winds were blown, 
a sudden [[silence]] sate upon the sea, 
and sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their way. 
the trojan, from the main, beheld a wood, 
which thick with shades and a brown [[horror]] stood: 
betwixt the trees the tiber took his course, 
with whirlpools dimpled; and with downward [[force]], 
that drove the sand along, he took his way, 
and roll'd his yellow billows to the sea. 
about him, and above, and round the wood, 
the birds that haunt the borders of his flood, 
that bath'd within, or basked upon his side, 
to tuneful songs [[song]] their narrow throats applied. 
the captain gives command; the joyful train 
glide thro' the gloomy shade, and leave the main. 
now, erato, thy poet's [[mind]] inspire, 
and fill his [[soul]] with thy celestial fire! 
relate what latium was; her ancient kings [[king]]; 
declare the [[past]] and [[state]] of things, 
when first the trojan fleet ausonia sought, 
and how the rivals lov'd, and how they fought. 
these are my theme, and how the [[war]] began, 
and how concluded by the godlike [[man]]: 
for i shall sing of battles [[battle]], [[blood]], and rage, 
which princes [[prince]] and their [[people]] did engage; 
and haughty souls [[soul]], that, mov'd with mutual hate, 
in fighting fields pursued and found their [[fate]]; 
that rous'd the tyrrhene realm with loud alarms, 
and peaceful [[italy]] involv'd in arms. 
a larger scene of action is display'd; 
and, rising hence, a greater [[work]] is weigh'd. 
latinus, old and mild, had long possess'd 
the latin scepter, and his [[people]] blest: 
his [[father]] faunus; a laurentian dame 
his [[mother]]; [[fair]] marica was her name. 
but faunus came from picus: picus drew 
his birth from saturn, if records be true. 
thus [[king]] latinus, in the third [[degree]], 
had saturn author of his [[family]]. 
but this old peaceful [[prince]], as heav'n decreed, 
was blest with no male issue to succeed: 
his sons [[son]] in blooming [[youth]] were snatch'd by [[fate]]; 
one only [[daughter]] heir'd the [[royal]] [[state]]. 
fir'd with her [[love]], and with [[ambition]] [[led]], 
the neighb'ring princes [[prince]] court her nuptial bed. 
among the crowd, but far above the rest, 
young turnus to the beauteous maid address'd. 
turnus, for high descent and graceful mien, 
was first, and favor'd by the latian queen; 
with him she strove to join lavinia's hand, 
but dire portents the purpos'd match withstand. 
deep in the palace, of long [[growth]], there stood 
a laurel's trunk, a venerable wood; 
where rites [[divine]] were paid; whose holy hair 
was kept and cut with [[superstitious]] [[care]]. 
this plant latinus, when his town he wall'd, 
then found, and from the tree laurentum call'd; 
and [[last]], in [[honor]] of his new abode, 
he vow'd the laurel to the laurel's [[god]]. 
it happen'd once (a boding prodigy!) 
a swarm of bees, that cut the liquid [[sky]], 
(unknown from whence they took their airy flight,) 
upon the topmost branch in clouds alight; 
there with their clasping feet together clung, 
and a long cluster from the laurel hung. 
an ancient augur prophesied from hence: 
"behold on latian shores a [[foreign]] prince! 
from the same parts of heav'n his navy stands, 
to the same parts on [[earth]]; his [[army]] lands [[land]]; 
the town he conquers, and the tow'r commands." 
yet more, when [[fair]] lavinia fed the [[fire]] 
before the gods, and stood beside her sire, 
(strange to relate!) the flames, involv'd in smoke 
of incense, from the [[sacred]] altar broke, 
caught her dishevel'd hair and [[rich]] attire; 
her [[crown]] and jewels crackled in the [[fire]]: 
from thence the fuming trail began to spread 
and lambent glories danc'd about her head. 
this new portent the seer with wonder views, 
then pausing, thus his prophecy renews: 
"the [[nymph]], who scatters flaming fires [[fire]] around, 
shall shine with [[honor]], shall herself be crown'd; 
but, caus'd by her irrevocable [[fate]], 
war shall the [[country]] waste, and [[change]] the [[state]]." 
latinus, frighted with this dire ostent, 
for counsel to his [[father]] faunus went, 
and sought the shades renown'd for prophecy 
which near albunea's sulph'rous fountain [[lie]]. 
to these the latian and the sabine [[land]] 
fly, when distress'd, and thence relief demand. 
the [[priest]] on skins of off'rings takes his ease, 
and nightly visions in his slumber sees; 
a swarm of thin aerial shapes appears, 
and, flutt'ring round his temples, deafs his ears: 
these he consults, the future fates [[fate]] to [[know]], 
from pow'rs above, and from the fiends below. 
here, for the gods' [[advice]], latinus flies, 
off'ring a hundred sheep for [[sacrifice]]: 
their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir'd, 
he laid beneath him, and to rest retir'd. 
no sooner were his [[eyes]] in slumber bound, 
when, from above, a more than mortal sound 
invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke: 
"seek not, my seed, in latian bands to yoke 
our [[fair]] lavinia, nor the gods provoke. 
a [[foreign]] [[son]] upon thy shore descends, 
whose martial fame from pole to pole extends. 
his [[race]], in arms and [[arts]] of [[peace]] renown'd, 
not latium shall contain, nor [[europe]] bound: 
't is theirs whate'er the sun surveys around." 
these answers [[answer]], in the silent night receiv'd, 
the [[king]] himself divulg'd, the [[land]] believ'd: 
the fame thro' all the neighb'ring nations flew, 
when now the trojan navy was in view. 
beneath a shady tree, the hero spread 
his table on the turf, with cakes of bread; 
and, with his chiefs [[chief]], on forest fruits he fed. 
they sate; and, (not without the god's command,) 
their homely fare dispatch'd, the hungry band 
invade their trenchers next, and soon devour, 
to mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour. 
ascanius this observ'd, and smiling said: 
"see, we devour the plates on which we fed." 
the [[speech]] had omen, that the trojan [[race]] 
should find repose, and this the [[time]] and place. 
aeneas took the word, and thus replies, 
confessing [[fate]] with wonder in his [[eyes]]: 
"all hail, o earth! all hail, my household gods! 
behold the destin'd place of your abodes! 
for thus anchises prophesied of old, 
and this our fatal place of rest foretold: 
'when, on a [[foreign]] shore, instead of meat, 
by famine forc'd, your trenchers you shall [[eat]], 
then ease your weary trojans will attend, 
and the long labors of your [[voyage]] end. 
remember on that [[happy]] coast to build, 
and with a trench inclose the fruitful field.' 
this was that famine, this the fatal place 
which ends the wand'ring of our exil'd [[race]]. 
then, on to-morrow's dawn, your [[care]] employ, 
to search the [[land]], and where the cities [[city]] [[lie]], 
and what the [[men]]; but give this day to joy. 
now pour to jove; and, after jove is blest, 
call [[great]] anchises to the genial feast: 
crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught; 
enjoy the [[present]] hour; adjourn the future [[thought]]." 
thus having said, the hero bound his brows 
with leafy branches, then perform'd his vows; 
adoring first the genius of the place, 
then [[earth]], the [[mother]] of the heav'nly [[race]], 
the nymphs [[nymph]], and native godheads yet unknown, 
and night, and all the stars that gild her sable [[throne]],

and ancient cybel, and idaean jove, 
and [[last]] his sire below, and [[mother]] queen above. 
then heav'n's high monarch thunder'd thrice aloud, 
and thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud. 
soon thro' the joyful camp a rumor flew, 
the [[time]] was come their [[city]] to renew. 
then ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown'd, 
the feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round. 
when next the rosy morn disclos'd the day, 
the scouts to sev'ral parts divide their way, 
to learn the natives' names, their towns explore, 
the coasts and trendings of the crooked shore: 
here tiber flows, and here numicus stands; 
here warlike latins hold the [[happy]] lands [[land]]. 
the pious [[chief]], who sought by peaceful ways 
to found his [[empire]], and his town to raise, 
a hundred youths [[youth]] from all his train selects, 
and to the latian court their course directs, 
(the spacious palace where their [[prince]] resides,) 
and all their heads with wreaths of olive hides. 
they go commission'd to require a [[peace]], 
and carry presents [[present]] to procure access. 
thus while they speed their pace, the [[prince]] designs 
his new-elected seat, and draws the lines. 
the trojans round the place a rampire cast, 
and palisades about the trenches plac'd. 
meantime the train, proceeding on their way, 
from far the town and lofty tow'rs survey; 
at length approach the walls. without the gate, 
they see the boys and latian [[youth]] debate 
the martial prizes on the dusty plain: 
some drive the cars, and some the coursers rein; 
some bend the stubborn bow for [[victory]], 
and some with darts their active sinews try. 
a posting messenger, dispatch'd from hence, 
of this [[fair]] troop advis'd their aged [[prince]], 
that [[foreign]] [[men]] of mighty stature came; 
uncouth their habit, and unknown their name. 
the [[king]] ordains their entrance, and ascends 
his regal seat, surrounded by his [[friends]]. 
the palace built by picus, vast and proud, 
supported by a hundred pillars stood, 
and round incompass'd with a rising wood. 
the pile o'erlook'd the town, and drew the sight; 
surpris'd at once with reverence and delight. 
there kings [[king]] receiv'd the marks of sov'reign pow'r; 
in [[state]] the monarchs march'd; the lictors bore 
their awful axes and the rods before. 
here the tribunal stood, the house of pray'r, 
and here the [[sacred]] senators repair; 
all at large tables, in long order set, 
a ram their off'ring, and a ram their meat. 
above the portal, carv'd in cedar wood, 
plac'd in their ranks, their godlike grandsires stood; 
old saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high; 
and italus, that [[led]] the colony; 
and ancient janus, with his double face, 
and bunch of keys, the porter of the place. 
there [[good]] sabinus, planter of the vines, 
on a short pruning hook his head reclines, 
and studiously surveys his gen'rous wines; 
then warlike kings [[king]], who for their [[country]] fought, 
and honorable wounds from [[battle]] brought. 
around the posts hung helmets, darts, and spears, 
and captive chariots, axes, shields, and bars, 
and broken beaks of ships, the trophies of their wars [[war]]. 
above the rest, as [[chief]] of all the band, 
was picus plac'd, a buckler in his hand; 
his other wav'd a long divining wand. 
girt in his gabin gown the hero sate, 
yet could not with his art [[arts]] avoid his [[fate]]: 
for circe long had lov'd the [[youth]] in [[vain]], 
till [[love]], refus'd, converted to disdain: 
then, mixing pow'rful herbs, with magic art [[arts]], 
she chang'd his form, who could not [[change]] his [[heart]]; 
constrain'd him in a bird, and made him fly, 
with party-color'd plumes, a chatt'ring pie. 
in this high temple, on a chair of [[state]], 
the seat of audience, old latinus sate; 
then gave admission to the trojan train; 
and thus with pleasing accents he began: 
"tell me, ye trojans, for that name you own, 
nor is your course upon our coasts unknown- 
say what you seek, and whither were you bound: 
were you by stress of weather cast aground? 
(such dangers as on seas are often seen, 
and oft befall to miserable [[men]],) 
or come, your shipping in our ports to lay, 
spent and disabled in so long a way? 
say what you want: the latians you shall find 
not forc'd to goodness, but by will inclin'd; 
for, since the [[time]] of saturn's holy reign, 
his hospitable customs we retain. 
i call to [[mind]] (but [[time]] the tale has worn) 
th' arunci told, that dardanus, tho' born 
on latian plains, yet sought the phrygian shore, 
and samothracia, samos call'd before. 
from tuscan coritum he claim'd his birth; 
but after, when exempt from mortal [[earth]], 
from thence ascended to his kindred skies [[sky]], 
a [[god]], and, as a [[god]], augments their [[sacrifice]]," 
he said. ilioneus made this reply: 
"o [[king]], of faunus' [[royal]] family! 
nor wintry winds to latium forc'd our way, 
nor did the stars our wand'ring course betray. 
willing we sought your shores; and, hither bound, 
the port, so long desir'd, at length we found; 
from our sweet homes [[home]] and ancient realms expell'd; 
great as the [[greatest]] that the sun beheld. 
the [[god]] began our line, who rules [[rule]] above; 
and, as our [[race]], our [[king]] descends from jove: 
and hither are we come, by his command, 
to crave admission in your [[happy]] [[land]]. 
how dire a tempest, from mycenae pour'd, 
our plains, our temples, and our town devour'd; 
what was the waste of [[war]], what fierce alarms 
shook asia's [[crown]] with [[european]] arms; 
ev'n such have heard, if any such there be, 
whose [[earth]] is bounded by the frozen sea; 
and such as, born beneath the burning [[sky]] 
and sultry sun, betwixt the tropics [[lie]]. 
from that dire deluge, thro' the wat'ry waste, 
such length of years, such various perils [[past]], 
at [[last]] escap'd, to latium we repair, 
to beg what you without your want may spare: 
the [[common]] water, and the [[common]] air; 
sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes, 
fit to receive and serve our banish'd gods. 
nor our admission shall your realm disgrace, 
nor length of [[time]] our gratitude efface. 
besides, what endless [[honor]] you shall gain, 
to save and shelter troy's unhappy train! 
now, by my sov'reign, and his [[fate]], i swear, 
renown'd for [[faith]] in [[peace]], for [[force]] in [[war]]; 
oft our [[alliance]] other lands [[land]] desir'd, 
and, what we seek of you, of us requir'd. 
despite not then, that in our hands we bear 
these holy boughs, sue with words of pray'r. 
fate and the gods, by their supreme command, 
have doom'd our ships to seek the latian [[land]]. 
to these abodes our fleet [[apollo]] sends; 
here dardanus was born, and hither tends; 
where tuscan tiber rolls with rapid [[force]], 
and where numicus opes his holy source. 
besides, our [[prince]] presents [[present]], with his request, 
some small remains of what his sire possess'd. 
this golden charger, snatch'd from burning troy, 
anchises did in [[sacrifice]] employ; 
this [[royal]] robe and this tiara wore 
old priam, and this golden scepter bore 
in full assemblies, and in solemn games; 
these purple vests were weav'd by dardan dames." 
thus while he spoke, latinus roll'd around 
his [[eyes]], and fix'd a while upon the ground. 
intent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast; 
not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest, 
but pond'ring future things of wondrous weight; 
succession, [[empire]], and his daughter's [[fate]]. 
on these he mus'd within his thoughtful [[mind]], 
and then revolv'd what faunus had divin'd. 
this was the [[foreign]] [[prince]], by [[fate]] decreed 
to share his scepter, and lavinia's bed; 
this was the [[race]] that sure portents foreshew 
to sway the [[world]], and [[land]] and sea subdue. 
at length he rais'd his cheerful head, and spoke: 
"the pow'rs," said he, "the pow'rs we both invoke, 
to you, and yours, and mine, propitious be, 
and firm our [[purpose]] with their augury! 
have what you ask; your presents [[present]] i receive; 
land, where and when you please, with ample leave; 
partake and use my [[kingdom]] as your own; 
all shall be yours, while i command the [[crown]]: 
and, if my wish'd [[alliance]] please your [[king]], 
tell him he should not send the [[peace]], but bring. 
then let him not a friend's embraces [[fear]]; 
the [[peace]] is made when i behold him here. 
besides this [[answer]], tell my [[royal]] guest, 
i add to his commands my own request: 
one only [[daughter]] heirs my [[crown]] and [[state]], 
whom not our oracles, nor heav'n, nor [[fate]], 
nor frequent prodigies, permit to join 
with any native of th' ausonian line. 
a [[foreign]] son-in-law shall come from far 
(such is our doom), a [[chief]] renown'd in [[war]], 
whose [[race]] shall bear aloft the latian name, 
and thro' the conquer'd [[world]] diffuse our fame. 
himself to be the [[man]] the fates [[fate]] require, 
i firmly [[judge]], and, what i [[judge]], [[desire]]." 
he said, and then on each bestow'd a steed. 
three hundred horses, in high stables fed, 
stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress'd: 
of these he chose the fairest and the [[best]], 
to mount the trojan troop. at his command 
the steeds caparison'd with purple stand, 
with golden trappings, glorious to behold, 
and champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold. 
then to his absent guest the [[king]] decreed 
a pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed, 
who from their nostrils breath'd ethereal [[fire]]; 
whom circe stole from her celestial sire, 
by substituting mares produc'd on [[earth]], 
whose wombs conceiv'd a more than mortal birth. 
these draw the chariot which latinus sends, 
and the [[rich]] [[present]] to the [[prince]] commends. 
sublime on stately steeds the trojans borne, 
to their expecting [[lord]] with [[peace]] return. 
but [[jealous]] juno, from pachynus' height, 
as she from argos took her airy flight, 
beheld with envious [[eyes]] this hateful sight. 
she saw the trojan and his joyful train 
descend upon the shore, desert the main, 
design a town, and, with unhop'd [[success]], 
th' embassadors return with promis'd [[peace]]. 
then, pierc'd with [[pain]], she shook her haughty head, 
sigh'd from her inward [[soul]], and thus she said: 
"o hated offspring of my phrygian foes! 
o fates [[fate]] of troy, which juno's fates [[fate]] oppose! 
could they not fall unpitied on the plain, 
but slain revive, and, taken, scape again? 
when execrable troy in ashes lay, 
thro' fires [[fire]] and swords [[sword]] and seas they forc'd their way. 
then vanquish'd juno must in [[vain]] contend, 
her rage disarm'd, her [[empire]] at an end. 
breathless and tir'd, is all my fury spent? 
or does my glutted spleen at length relent? 
as if 't were little from their town to chase, 
i thro' the seas pursued their exil'd [[race]]; 
ingag'd the heav'ns, oppos'd the stormy main; 
but billows roar'd, and tempests rag'd in [[vain]]. 
what have my scyllas and my syrtes done, 
when these they overpass, and those they shun? 
on tiber's shores they [[land]], secure of [[fate]], 
triumphant o'er the storms and juno's hate. 
mars could in mutual [[blood]] the centaurs bathe, 
and jove himself gave way to cynthia's wrath, 
who sent the tusky boar to calydon; 
(what [[great]] offense had either [[people]] done?) 
but i, the consort of the thunderer, 
have wag'd a long and unsuccessful [[war]], 
with various [[arts]] and arms in [[vain]] have toil'd, 
and by a mortal [[man]] at length am foil'd. 
if native pow'r prevail not, shall i [[doubt]] 
to seek for needful succor from without? 
if jove and heav'n my just desires [[desire]] deny, 
hell shall the pow'r of heav'n and jove supply. 
grant that the fates [[fate]] have firm'd, by their decree, 
the trojan [[race]] to reign in [[italy]]; 
at least i can defer the nuptial day, 
and with protracted wars [[war]] the [[peace]] delay: 
with [[blood]] the dear [[alliance]] shall be bought, 
and both the [[people]] near destruction brought; 
so shall the son-in-law and [[father]] join, 
with ruin, [[war]], and waste of either line. 
o fatal maid, thy [[marriage]] is endow'd 
with phrygian, latian, andrutulian blood! 
bellona leads thee to thy lover's hand; 
another queen brings forth another brand, 
to burn with [[foreign]] fires [[fire]] another land! 
a second [[paris]], diff'ring but in name, 
shall [[fire]] his [[country]] with a second flame." 
thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground, 
with furious haste, and shoots the stygian sound, 
to rouse alecto from th' infernal seat 
of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat. 
this fury, fit for her intent, she chose; 
one who delights in wars [[war]] and [[human]] woes. 
ev'n pluto hates his own misshapen [[race]]; 
her sister furies fly her hideous face; 
so frightful are the forms the monster takes, 
so fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes. 
her juno finds, and thus inflames her spite: 
"o virgin [[daughter]] of eternal night, 
give me this once thy labor, to sustain 
my [[right]], and execute my just disdain. 
let not the trojans, with a feign'd pretense 
of proffer'd [[peace]], delude the latian [[prince]]. 
expel from [[italy]] that odious name, 
and let not juno suffer in her fame. 
't is thine to ruin realms, o'erturn a [[state]], 
betwixt the dearest [[friends]] to raise debate, 
and kindle kindred [[blood]] to mutual hate. 
thy hand o'er towns the fun'ral torch displays, 
and forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways. 
now shake, out thy fruitful breast, the seeds 
of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds: 
confound the [[peace]] establish'd, and prepare 
their souls [[soul]] to [[hatred]], and their hands to [[war]]." 
smear'd as she was with black gorgonian [[blood]], 
the fury sprang above the stygian flood; 
and on her wicker wings, sublime thro' night, 
she to the latian palace took her flight: 
there sought the queen's apartment, stood before 
the peaceful threshold, and besieg'd the door. 
restless amata lay, her swelling breast 
fir'd with disdain for turnus dispossess'd, 
and the new nuptials of the trojan guest. 
from her black bloody locks the fury shakes 
her darling plague, the fav'rite of her snakes; 
with her full [[force]] she threw the poisonous dart, 
and fix'd it deep within amata's [[heart]], 
that, thus envenom'd, she might kindle rage, 
and [[sacrifice]] to strife her house husband's [[age]]. 
unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims 
betwixt her linen and her naked limbs; 
his baleful breath inspiring, as he glides, 
now like a chain around her neck he rides, 
now like a fillet to her head repairs, 
and with his circling volumes folds her hairs. 
at first the silent venom slid with ease, 
and seiz'd her cooler senses by degrees [[degree]]; 
then, ere th' infected mass was fir'd too far, 
in plaintive accents she began the [[war]], 
and thus bespoke her husband: "shall," she said, 
"a wand'ring [[prince]] enjoy lavinia's bed? 
if [[nature]] plead not in a parent's [[heart]], 
pity my tears, and [[pity]] her desert. 
i [[know]], my dearest [[lord]], the [[time]] will come, 
you in [[vain]], reverse your cruel doom; 
the faithless pirate soon will set to sea, 
and bear the [[royal]] virgin far away! 
a guest like him, a trojan guest before, 
in shew of [[friendship]] sought the spartan shore, 
and ravish'd helen from her husband bore. 
think on a king's inviolable word; 
and [[think]] on turnus, her once plighted [[lord]]: 
to this false foreigner you give your [[throne]], 
and [[wrong]] a friend, a kinsman, and a [[son]]. 
resume your ancient [[care]]; and, if the [[god]] 
your sire, and you, resolve on [[foreign]] [[blood]], 
know all are [[foreign]], in a larger sense, 
not born your subjects [[subject]], or deriv'd from hence. 
then, if the line of turnus you retrace, 
he springs from inachus of argive [[race]]." 
but when she saw her reasons [[reason]] idly spent, 
and could not move him from his fix'd intent, 
she flew to rage; for now the snake possess'd 
her vital parts, and poison'd all her breast; 
she raves, she runs with a distracted pace, 
and fills with horrid howls the [[public]] place. 
and, as [[young]] striplings whip the top for [[sport]], 
on the smooth pavement of an empty court; 
the wooden engine flies and whirls about, 
admir'd, with clamors, of the beardless rout; 
they lash aloud; each other they provoke, 
and lend their little souls [[soul]] at ev'ry stroke: 
thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows 
amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes. 
nor yet content, she strains her malice more, 
and adds new ills to those contriv'd before: 
she flies the town, and, mixing with a throng 
of madding matrons, bears the bride along, 
wand'ring thro' woods and wilds, and devious ways, 
and with these [[arts]] the trojan match delays. 
she feign'd the rites of bacchus; cried aloud, 
and to the buxom [[god]] the virgin vow'd. 
"evoe! o bacchus!" thus began the [[song]]; 
and "evoe!" answer'd all the female throng. 
"o virgin! worthy thee alone!" she cried; 
"o worthy thee alone!" the crew replied. 
"for thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance, 
and with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance." 
like fury seiz'd the rest; the [[progress]] known, 
all seek the mountains, and forsake the town: 
all, clad in skins of beasts, the jav'lin bear, 
give to the wanton winds their flowing hair, 
and shrieks and shoutings rend the suff'ring air. 
the queen herself, inspir'd with rage [[divine]], 
shook high above her head a flaming pine; 
then roll'd her haggard [[eyes]] around the throng, 
and sung, in turnus' name, the nuptial [[song]]: 
"io, ye latian dames! if any here 
hold your unhappy queen, amata, dear; 
if there be here," she said, who dare maintain 
my [[right]], nor [[think]] the name of [[mother]] [[vain]]; 
unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair, 
and orgies and nocturnal rites prepare." 
amata's breast the fury thus invades, 
and fires [[fire]] with rage, amid the sylvan shades; 
then, when she found her venom spread so far, 
the [[royal]] house embroil'd in civil [[war]], 
rais'd on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies [[sky]], 
and seeks the palace where [[young]] turnus lies [[lie]]. 
his town, as fame reports, was built of old 
by danae, pregnant with almighty gold, 
who fled her father's rage, and, with a train 
of following argives, thro' the stormy main, 
driv'n by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign. 
't was ardua once; now ardea's name it bears; 
once a [[fair]] [[city]], now consum'd with years. 
here, in his lofty palace, turnus lay, 
betwixt the confines of the night and day, 
secure in sleep. the fury laid aside 
her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried 
the foulness of th' infernal form to hide. 
propp'd on a staff, she takes a trembling mien: 
her face is furrow'd, and her front obscene; 
deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws; 
sunk are her [[eyes]], and toothless are her jaws; 
her hoary hair with holy fillets bound, 
her temples with an olive wreath are crown'd. 
old chalybe, who kept the [[sacred]] fane 
of juno, now she seem'd, and thus began, 
appearing in a [[dream]], to rouse the careless [[man]]: 
"shall turnus then such endless toil sustain 
in fighting fields, and conquer towns in [[vain]]? 
win, for a trojan head to wear the prize, 
usurp thy [[crown]], enjoy thy victories [[victory]]? 
the bride and scepter which thy [[blood]] has bought, 
the [[king]] transfers; and [[foreign]] heirs are sought. 
go now, deluded [[man]], and seek again 
new toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain. 
repel the tuscan foes; their [[city]] seize; 
protect the latians in luxurious ease. 
this [[dream]] all-pow'rful juno sends; i bear 
her mighty mandates, and her words you hear. 
haste; arm your ardeans; issue to the plain; 
with [[fate]] to friend, assault the trojan train: 
their thoughtless chiefs [[chief]], their painted ships, that [[lie]] 
in tiber's mouth, with [[fire]] and [[sword]] [[destroy]]. 
the latian [[king]], unless he shall submit, 
own his old promise, and his new forget- 
let him, in arms, the pow'r of turnus prove, 
and learn to [[fear]] whom he disdains to [[love]]. 
for such is heav'n's command." the youthful [[prince]] 
with scorn replied, and made this bold defense: 
"you tell me, [[mother]], what i knew before: 
the phrygian fleet is landed on the shore. 
i neither [[fear]] nor will provoke the [[war]]; 
my [[fate]] is juno's most peculiar [[care]]. 
but [[time]] has made you dote, and vainly tell 
of arms imagin'd in your lonely cell. 
go; be the temple and the gods your [[care]]; 
permit to [[men]] the [[thought]] of [[peace]] and [[war]]." 
these haughty words alecto's rage provoke, 
and frighted turnus trembled as she spoke. 
her [[eyes]] grow stiffen'd, and with sulphur burn; 
her hideous looks and hellish form return; 
her curling snakes with hissings fill the place, 
and open all the furies of her face: 
then, darting [[fire]] from her malignant [[eyes]], 
she cast him backward as he strove to rise, 
and, ling'ring, sought to frame some new replies. 
high on her head she rears two twisted snakes, 
her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes; 
and, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks: 
"behold whom [[time]] has made to dote, and tell 
of arms imagin'd in her lonely cell! 
behold the fates' infernal minister! 
war, [[death]], destruction, in my hand i bear." 
thus having said, her smold'ring torch, impress'd 
with her full [[force]], she plung'd into his breast. 
aghast he wak'd; and, starting from his bed, 
cold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs o'erspread. 
"arms! arms!" he cries: "my [[sword]] and shield prepare!" 
he breathes defiance, [[blood]], and mortal [[war]]. 
so, when with crackling flames a caldron fries, 
the bubbling waters from the bottom rise: 
above the brims they [[force]] their fiery way; 
black vapors climb aloft, and cloud the day. 
the [[peace]] polluted thus, a chosen band 
he first commissions to the latian [[land]], 
in threat'ning embassy; then rais'd the rest, 
to meet in arms th' intruding trojan guest, 
to [[force]] the foes from the lavinian shore, 
and italy's indanger'd [[peace]] restore. 
himself alone an [[equal]] match he boasts, 
to [[fight]] the phrygian and ausonian hosts. 
the gods invok'd, the rutuli prepare 
their arms, and warn each other to the [[war]]. 
his [[beauty]] these, and those his blooming [[age]], 
the rest his house and his own fame ingage. 
while turnus urges thus his enterprise, 
the stygian fury to the trojans flies; 
new frauds invents, and takes a steepy stand, 
which overlooks the vale with wide command; 
where [[fair]] ascanius and his youthful train, 
with horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain, 
and pitch their toils around the shady plain. 
the fury fires [[fire]] the pack; they snuff, they vent, 
and feed their hungry nostrils with the scent. 
'twas of a well-grown stag, whose antlers rise 
high o'er his front; his beams invade the skies [[sky]]. 
from this [[light]] cause th' infernal maid prepares 
the [[country]] churls to mischief, hate, and wars [[war]]. 
the stately beast the two tyrrhidae bred, 
snatch'd from his dams, and the tame youngling fed. 
their [[father]] tyrrheus did his fodder bring, 
tyrrheus, [[chief]] ranger to the latian [[king]]: 
their sister silvia cherish'd with her [[care]] 
the little wanton, and did wreaths prepare 
to hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied 
his tender neck, and comb'd his silken hide, 
and bathed his [[body]]. patient of command 
in [[time]] he grew, and, growing us'd to hand, 
he waited at his master's board for food; 
then sought his salvage kindred in the wood, 
where grazing all the day, at night he came 
to his known lodgings, and his [[country]] dame. 
this household beast, that us'd the woodland grounds, 
was view'd at first by the [[young]] hero's hounds, 
as down the stream he swam, to seek retreat 
in the cool waters, and to quench his heat. 
ascanius [[young]], and eager of his game, 
soon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim; 
but the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides, 
which pierc'd his bowels thro' his panting sides. 
the bleeding creature issues from the floods, 
possess'd with [[fear]], and seeks his known abodes, 
his old familiar hearth and household gods. 
he falls; he fills the house with heavy groans, 
implores their [[pity]], and his [[pain]] bemoans. 
young silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud 
for succor from the clownish neighborhood: 
the churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay 
in the close woody covert, urg'd their way. 
one with a brand yet burning from the flame, 
arm'd with a knotty club another came: 
whate'er they catch or find, without their [[care]], 
their fury makes an instrument of [[war]]. 
tyrrheus, the foster [[father]] of the beast, 
then clench'd a hatchet in his horny fist, 
but held his hand from the descending stroke, 
and left his wedge within the cloven oak, 
to whet their [[courage]] and their rage provoke. 
and now the [[goddess]], exercis'd in ill, 
who watch'd an hour to [[work]] her impious will, 
ascends the roof, and to her crooked horn, 
such as was then by latian shepherds borne, 
adds all her breath: the rocks and woods around, 
and mountains, tremble at th' infernal sound. 
the [[sacred]] lake of trivia from afar, 
the veline fountains, and sulphureous nar, 
shake at the baleful blast, the signal of the [[war]]. 
young mothers [[mother]] wildly stare, with [[fear]] possess'd, 
and strain their helpless infants to their breast. 
the clowns, a boist'rous, rude, ungovern'd crew, 
with furious haste to the loud summons flew. 
the pow'rs of troy, then issuing on the plain, 
with fresh recruits their youthful [[chief]] sustain: 
not theirs a raw and unexperienc'd train, 
but a firm [[body]] of embattled [[men]]. 
at first, while [[fortune]] favor'd neither side, 
the [[fight]] with clubs and burning brands was tried; 
but now, both parties reinforc'd, the fields 
are bright with flaming swords [[sword]] and brazen shields. 
a shining harvest either host displays, 
and shoots against the sun with [[equal]] rays. 
thus, when a black-brow'd gust begins to rise, 
white foam at first on the curl'd ocean fries; 
then roars the main, the billows mount the skies [[sky]]; 
till, by the fury of the storm full blown, 
the muddy bottom o'er the clouds is thrown. 
first almon falls, old tyrrheus' eldest [[care]], 
pierc'd with an arrow from the distant [[war]]: 
fix'd in his throat the flying weapon stood, 
and stopp'd his breath, and drank his vital [[blood]] 
huge heaps of slain around the [[body]] rise: 
among the rest, the [[rich]] galesus lies [[lie]]; 
a [[good]] old [[man]], while [[peace]] he preach'd in [[vain]], 
amidst the madness of th' unruly train: 
five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures fill'd; 
his lands [[land]] a hundred yoke of oxen till'd. 
thus, while in [[equal]] scales their [[fortune]] stood 
the fury bath'd them in each other's [[blood]]; 
then, having fix'd the [[fight]], exulting flies, 
and bears fulfill'd her promise to the skies [[sky]]. 
to juno thus she speaks: "behold! it is done, 
the [[blood]] already drawn, the [[war]] begun; 
the discord is complete; nor can they cease 
the dire debate, nor you command the [[peace]]. 
now, since the latian and the trojan brood 
have tasted vengeance and the sweets of [[blood]]; 
speak, and my pow'r shall add this office more: 
the neighb'ing nations of th' ausonian shore 
shall hear the dreadful rumor, from afar, 
of arm'd [[invasion]], and embrace the [[war]]." 
then juno thus: "the grateful [[work]] is done, 
the seeds of discord sow'd, the [[war]] begun; 
frauds, fears [[fear]], and fury have possess'd the [[state]], 
and fix'd the causes of a lasting hate. 
a bloody hymen shall th' [[alliance]] join 
betwixt the trojan and ausonian line: 
but thou with speed to night and hell repair; 
for not the gods, nor angry jove, will bear 
thy lawless wand'ring walks in upper air. 
leave what remains to me." saturnia said: 
the sullen fiend her sounding wings display'd, 
unwilling left the [[light]], and sought the nether shade. 
in midst of [[italy]], well known to fame, 
there lies [[lie]] a lake (amsanctus is the name) 
below the lofty mounts: on either side 
thick forests the forbidden entrance hide. 
full in the center of the [[sacred]] wood 
an arm arises of the stygian flood, 
which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound, 
whirls the black waves and rattling stones around. 
here pluto pants for breath from out his cell, 
and opens wide the grinning jaws of hell. 
to this infernal lake the fury flies; 
here hides her hated head, and frees the lab'ring skies [[sky]].

saturnian juno now, with double [[care]], 
attends the fatal process of the [[war]]. 
the clowns, return'd, from [[battle]] bear the slain, 
implore the gods, and to their [[king]] [[complain]]. 
the corps of almon and the rest are shown; 
shrieks, clamors, murmurs, fill the frighted town. 
ambitious turnus in the press appears, 
and, aggravating crimes, augments their fears [[fear]]; 
proclaims his private injuries aloud, 
a solemn promise made, and disavow'd; 
a [[foreign]] [[son]] is sought, and a mix'd mungril brood. 
then they, whose mothers [[mother]], frantic with their [[fear]], 
in woods and wilds the flags of bacchus bear, 
and lead his dances with dishevel'd hair, 
increase the clamor, and the [[war]] demand, 
(such was amata's interest in the [[land]],) 
against the [[public]] sanctions of the [[peace]], 
against all omens of their ill [[success]]. 
with fates [[fate]] averse, the rout in arms resort, 
to [[force]] their monarch, and insult the court. 
but, like a rock unmov'd, a rock that braves 
the raging tempest and the rising waves- 
propp'd on himself he stands; his solid sides 
wash off the seaweeds, and the sounding tides- 
so stood the pious [[prince]], unmov'd, and long 
sustain'd the madness of the noisy throng. 
but, when he found that juno's pow'r prevail'd, 
and all the methods of cool counsel fail'd, 
he calls the gods to witness their offense, 
disclaims the [[war]], asserts his innocence. 
"hurried by [[fate]]," he cries, "and borne before 
a furious wind, we have the faithful shore. 
o more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear 
the guilt of [[blood]] and sacrilegious [[war]]: 
thou, turnus, shalt atone it by thy [[fate]], 
and [[pray]] to heav'n for [[peace]], but [[pray]] too late. 
for me, my stormy [[voyage]] at an end, 
i to the port of [[death]] securely tend. 
the fun'ral pomp which to your kings [[king]] you [[pay]], 
is all i want, and all you take away." 
he said no more, but, in his walls confin'd, 
shut out the woes which he too well divin'd 
nor with the rising storm would vainly strive, 
but left the helm, and let the vessel drive. 
a solemn custom was observ'd of old, 
which latium held, and now the romans hold, 
their standard when in fighting fields they rear 
against the fierce hyrcanians, or declare 
the scythian, [[indian]], or arabian [[war]]; 
or from the boasting parthians would regain 
their eagles, lost in carrhae's bloody plain. 
two gates of steel (the name of [[mars]] they bear, 
and still are worship'd with [[religious]] fear) 
before his temple stand: the dire abode, 
and the fear'd issues of the furious [[god]], 
are fenc'd with brazen bolts; without the gates, 
the wary guardian janus doubly waits. 
then, when the [[sacred]] senate votes the wars [[war]], 
the roman consul their decree declares, 
and in his robes the sounding gates unbars. 
the [[youth]] in [[military]] shouts arise, 
and the loud trumpets break the yielding skies [[sky]]. 
these rites, of old by sov'reign princes [[prince]] us'd, 
were the king's office; but the [[king]] refus'd, 
deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar 
of [[sacred]] [[peace]], or loose th' imprison'd [[war]]; 
but hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms, 
abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms. 
then heav'n's imperious queen shot down from high: 
at her approach the brazen hinges fly; 
the gates are forc'd, and ev'ry falling bar; 
and, like a tempest, issues out the [[war]]. 
the peaceful cities [[city]] of th' ausonian shore, 
lull'd in their ease, and undisturb'd before, 
are all on [[fire]]; and some, with studious [[care]], 
their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare; 
some their soft limbs in painful marches try, 
and [[war]] is all their [[wish]], and arms the gen'ral cry. 
part scour the rusty shields with seam; and part 
new grind the blunted ax, and point the dart: 
with joy they view the waving ensigns fly, 
and hear the trumpet's clangor pierce the [[sky]]. 
five cities [[city]] forge their arms: th' atinian pow'rs, 
antemnae, tibur with her lofty tow'rs, 
ardea the proud, the crustumerian town: 
all these of old were places of renown. 
some hammer helmets for the fighting field; 
some twine [[young]] sallows to support the shield; 
the croslet some, and some the cuishes mold, 
with silver plated, and with ductile gold. 
the rustic honors of the scythe and share 
give place to swords [[sword]] and plumes, the [[pride]] of [[war]]. 
old fauchions are new temper'd in the fires [[fire]]; 
the sounding trumpet ev'ry [[soul]] inspires. 
the word is giv'n; with eager speed they lace 
the shining headpiece, and the shield embrace. 
the neighing steeds are to the chariot tied; 
the trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side. 
and now the mighty labor is begun 
ye muses, open all your helicon. 
sing you the chiefs [[chief]] that sway'd th' ausonian [[land]], 
their arms, and armies [[army]] under their command; 
what warriors in our ancient clime were bred; 
what soldiers follow'd, and what heroes [[led]]. 
for well you [[know]], and can record alone, 
what fame to future times [[time]] conveys but darkly down. 
mezentius first appear'd upon the plain: 
scorn sate upon his brows, and sour disdain, 
defying [[earth]] and heav'n. etruria lost, 
he brings to turnus' aid his baffled host. 
the charming lausus, full of youthful [[fire]], 
rode in the rank, and next his sullen sire; 
to turnus only second in the grace 
of manly mien, and features of the face. 
a skilful horseman, and a huntsman bred, 
with fates [[fate]] averse a thousand [[men]] he [[led]]: 
his sire unworthy of so brave a [[son]]; 
himself well worthy of a happier [[throne]]. 
next aventinus drives his chariot round 
the latian plains, with palms and laurels crown'd. 
proud of his steeds, he smokes along the field; 
his father's hydra fills his ample shield: 
a hundred serpents hiss about the brims; 
the [[son]] of hercules he justly seems 
by his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs; 
of heav'nly part, and part of earthly [[blood]], 
a mortal woman mixing with a [[god]]. 
for [[strong]] alcides, after he had slain 
the triple geryon, drove from conquer'd [[spain]] 
his captive herds; and, thence in triumph [[led]], 
on tuscan tiber's flow'ry banks they fed. 
then on mount aventine the [[son]] of jove 
the priestess rhea found, and forc'd to [[love]]. 
for arms, his [[men]] long piles and jav'lins bore; 
and poles with pointed steel their foes in [[battle]] gore. 
like hercules himself his [[son]] appears, 
in salvage pomp; a lion's hide he wears; 
about his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin; 
the teeth and gaping jaws severely grin. 
thus, like the [[god]] his [[father]], homely dress'd, 
he strides into the hall, a horrid guest. 
then two twin brothers [[brother]] from [[fair]] tibur came, 
(which from their [[brother]] tiburs took the name,) 
fierce coras and catillus, void of [[fear]]: 
arm'd argive horse they [[led]], and in the front appear. 
like cloud-born centaurs, from the mountain's height 
with rapid course descending to the [[fight]]; 
they rush along; the rattling woods give way; 
the branches bend before their sweepy sway. 
nor was praeneste's founder wanting there, 
whom fame reports the [[son]] of mulciber: 
found in the [[fire]], and foster'd in the plains, 
a shepherd and a [[king]] at once he reigns, 
and leads to turnus' aid his [[country]] swains. 
his own praeneste sends a chosen band, 
with those who plow saturnia's gabine [[land]]; 
besides the succor which cold anien yields, 
the rocks of hernicus, and dewy fields, 
anagnia fat, and [[father]] amasene- 
a num'rous rout, but all of naked [[men]]: 
nor arms they wear, nor swords [[sword]] and bucklers wield, 
nor drive the chariot thro' the dusty field, 
but whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead, 
and spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head; 
the left foot naked, when they march to [[fight]], 
but in a bull's raw hide they sheathe the [[right]]. 
messapus next, (great [[neptune]] was his sire,) 
secure of steel, and fated from the [[fire]], 
in pomp appears, and with his ardor warms 
a heartless train, unexercis'd in arms: 
the just faliscans he to [[battle]] brings, 
and those who [[live]] where lake ciminia springs; 
and where feronia's grove and temple stands, 
who till fescennian or flavinian lands [[land]]. 
all these in order march, and marching sing 
the warlike actions of their sea-born [[king]]; 
like a long team of snowy swans on high, 
which clap their wings, and cleave the liquid [[sky]], 
when, homeward from their wat'ry pastures borne, 
they sing, and asia's lakes their notes return. 
not one who heard their [[music]] from afar, 
would [[think]] these [[troops]] an [[army]] train'd to [[war]], 
but flocks of fowl, that, when the tempests roar, 
with their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore. 
then clausus came, who [[led]] a num'rous band 
of [[troops]] embodied from the sabine [[land]], 
and, in himself alone, an [[army]] brought. 
't was he, the [[noble]] claudian [[race]] begot, 
the claudian [[race]], ordain'd, in times [[time]] to come, 
to share the greatness of imperial [[rome]]. 
he [[led]] the cures forth, of old renown, 
mutuscans from their olive-bearing town, 
and all th' eretian pow'rs; besides a band 
that follow'd from velinum's dewy [[land]], 
and amiternian [[troops]], of mighty fame, 
and mountaineers, that from severus came, 
and from the craggy cliffs of tetrica, 
and those where yellow tiber takes his way, 
and where himella's wanton waters play. 
casperia sends her arms, with those that [[lie]] 
by fabaris, and fruitful foruli: 
the warlike aids of horta next appear, 
and the cold nursians come to close the rear, 
mix'd with the natives born of latine [[blood]], 
whom allia washes with her fatal flood. 
not thicker billows beat the libyan main, 
when pale orion sets in wintry rain; 
nor thicker harvests on [[rich]] hermus rise, 
or lycian fields, when phoebus burns the skies [[sky]], 
than stand these [[troops]]: their bucklers ring around; 
their trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground.

high in his chariot then halesus came, 
a foe by birth to troy's unhappy name: 
from [[agamemnon]] born- to turnus' aid 
a thousand [[men]] the youthful hero [[led]], 
who till the massic soil, for wine renown'd, 
and fierce auruncans from their hilly ground, 
and those who [[live]] by sidicinian shores, 
and where with shoaly fords vulturnus roars, 
cales' and osca's old inhabitants, 
and rough saticulans, inur'd to wants: 
light demi-lances from afar they throw, 
fasten'd with leathern thongs, to gall the foe. 
short crooked swords [[sword]] in closer [[fight]] they wear; 
and on their warding arm [[light]] bucklers bear. 
nor oebalus, shalt thou be left unsung, 
from [[nymph]] semethis and old telon sprung, 
who then in teleboan capri reign'd; 
but that short isle th' ambitious [[youth]] disdain'd, 
and o'er campania stretch'd his ample sway, 
where swelling sarnus seeks the tyrrhene sea; 
o'er batulum, and where abella sees, 
from her high tow'rs, the harvest of her trees. 
and these (as was the teuton use of old) 
wield brazen swords [[sword]], and brazen bucklers hold; 
sling weighty stones, when from afar they [[fight]]; 
their casques are cork, a covering thick and [[light]]. 
next these in rank, the warlike ufens went, 
and [[led]] the mountain [[troops]] that nursia sent. 
the rude equicolae his [[rule]] obey'd; 
hunting their [[sport]], and plund'ring was their [[trade]]. 
in arms they plow'd, to [[battle]] still prepar'd: 
their soil was barren, and their hearts [[heart]] were hard. 
umbro the [[priest]] the proud marrubians [[led]], 
by [[king]] archippus sent to turnus' aid, 
and peaceful olives crown'd his hoary head. 
his wand and holy words, the viper's rage, 
and venom'd wounds of serpents could assuage. 
he, when he pleas'd with powerful juice to steep 
their temples, shut their [[eyes]] in pleasing sleep. 
but [[vain]] were marsian herbs, and magic art [[arts]], 
to cure the wound giv'n by the dardan dart: 
yet his untimely [[fate]] th' angitian woods 
in sighs remurmur'd to the fucine floods. 
the [[son]] of fam'd hippolytus was there, 
fam'd as his sire, and, as his [[mother]], [[fair]]; 
whom in egerian groves aricia bore, 
and nurs'd his [[youth]] along the marshy shore, 
where [[great]] diana's peaceful altars flame, 
in fruitful fields; and virbius was his name. 
hippolytus, as old records have said, 
was by his stepdam sought to share her bed; 
but, when no female [[arts]] his [[mind]] could move, 
she turn'd to furious hate her impious [[love]]. 
torn by wild horses on the sandy shore, 
another's crimes th' unhappy hunter bore, 
glutting his father's [[eyes]] with guiltless gore. 
but chaste diana, who his [[death]] deplor'd, 
with aesculapian herbs his [[life]] restor'd. 
then jove, who saw from high, with just disdain, 
the [[dead]] inspir'd with vital breath again, 
struck to the center, with his flaming dart, 
th' unhappy founder of the godlike art [[arts]]. 
but trivia kept in secret shades alone 
her [[care]], hippolytus, to [[fate]] unknown; 
and call'd him virbius in th' egerian grove, 
where then he liv'd obscure, but safe from jove. 
for this, from trivia's temple and her wood 
are coursers driv'n, who shed their master's [[blood]], 
affrighted by the monsters of the flood. 
his [[son]], the second virbius, yet retain'd 
his father's art [[arts]], and warrior steeds he rein'd. 
amid the [[troops]], and like the leading [[god]], 
high o'er the rest in arms the graceful turnus rode: 
a triple of plumes his crest adorn'd, 
on which with belching flames chimaera burn'd: 
the more the kindled combat rises high'r, 
the more with fury burns the blazing [[fire]]. 
fair io grac'd his shield; but io now 
with horns exalted stands, and seems to low- 
a [[noble]] charge! her keeper by her side, 
to watch her walks, his hundred [[eyes]] applied; 
and on the brims her sire, the wat'ry [[god]], 
roll'd from a silver urn his crystal flood. 
a cloud of foot succeeds, and fills the fields 
with swords [[sword]], and pointed spears, and clatt'ring shields;

of argives, and of old sicanian bands, 
and those who plow the [[rich]] rutulian lands [[land]]; 
auruncan [[youth]], and those sacrana yields, 
and the proud labicans, with painted shields, 
and those who near numician streams reside, 
and those whom tiber's holy forests hide, 
or circe's hills from the main [[land]] divide; 
where ufens glides along the lowly lands [[land]], 
or the black water of pomptina stands. 
last, from the volscians [[fair]] camilla came, 
and [[led]] her warlike [[troops]], a warrior dame; 
unbred to spinning, in the loom unskill'd, 
she chose the nobler pallas of the field. 
mix'd with the first, the fierce virago fought, 
sustain'd the toils of arms, the danger sought, 
outstripp'd the winds in speed upon the plain, 
flew o'er the fields, nor hurt the bearded grain: 
she swept the seas, and, as she skimm'd along, 
her flying feet unbath'd on billows hung. 
men, boys, and [[women]], stupid with surprise, 
where'er she passes, fix their wond'ring [[eyes]]: 
longing they look, and, gaping at the sight, 
devour her o'er and o'er with vast delight; 
her purple habit sits with such a grace 
on her smooth shoulders, and so suits her face; 
her head with ringlets of her hair is crown'd, 
and in a golden caul the curls are bound. 
she shakes her myrtle jav'lin; and, behind, 
her lycian quiver dances in the wind.

book viii

when turnus had assembled all his pow'rs, 
his standard planted on laurentum's tow'rs; 
when now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, 
had giv'n the signal of approaching [[war]], 
had rous'd the neighing steeds to scour the fields, 
while the fierce riders clatter'd on their shields; 
trembling with rage, the latian [[youth]] prepare 
to join th' allies, and headlong rush to [[war]]. 
fierce ufens, and messapus, [[led]] the crowd, 
with bold mezentius, who blasphem'd aloud. 
these thro' the [[country]] took their wasteful course, 
the fields to forage, and to gather [[force]]. 
then venulus to diomede they send, 
to beg his aid ausonia to defend, 
declare the [[common]] danger, and inform 
the grecian leader of the growing storm: 
aeneas, landed on the latian coast, 
with banish'd gods, and with a baffled host, 
yet now aspir'd to [[conquest]] of the [[state]], 
and claim'd a title from the gods and [[fate]]; 
what num'rous nations in his quarrel came, 
and how they spread his formidable name. 
what he design'd, what mischief might arise, 
if [[fortune]] favor'd his first enterprise, 
was left for him to weigh, whose [[equal]] fears [[fear]], 
and [[common]] interest, was involv'd in theirs. 
while turnus and th' allies thus urge the [[war]], 
the trojan, floating in a flood of [[care]], 
beholds the tempest which his foes prepare. 
this way and that he turns his anxious [[mind]]; 
thinks, and rejects the counsels he design'd; 
explores himself in [[vain]], in ev'ry part, 
and gives no rest to his distracted [[heart]]. 
so, when the sun by day, or moon by night, 
strike on the polish'd brass their trembling [[light]], 
the glitt'ring [[species]] here and there divide, 
and cast their dubious beams from side to side; 
now on the walls, now on the pavement play, 
and to the ceiling flash the glaring day. 
't was night; and weary [[nature]] lull'd asleep 
the birds of air, and fishes of the deep, 
and beasts, and mortal [[men]]. the trojan [[chief]] 
was laid on tiber's banks, oppress'd with [[grief]], 
and found in silent slumber late relief. 
then, thro' the shadows of the poplar wood, 
arose the [[father]] of the roman flood; 
an azure robe was o'er his [[body]] spread, 
a wreath of shady reeds adorn'd his head: 
thus, manifest to sight, the [[god]] appear'd, 
and with these pleasing words his [[sorrow]] cheer'd: 
"undoubted offspring of ethereal [[race]], 
o long expected in this promis'd place! 
who thro' the foes hast borne thy banish'd gods, 
restor'd them to their hearths, and old abodes; 
this is thy [[happy]] [[home]], the clime where [[fate]] 
ordains thee to restore the trojan [[state]]. 
fear not! the [[war]] shall end in lasting [[peace]], 
and all the rage of haughty juno cease. 
and that this nightly vision may not seem 
th' effect of fancy, or an idle [[dream]], 
a sow beneath an oak shall [[lie]] along, 
all [[white]] herself, and [[white]] her thirty [[young]]. 
when thirty rolling years have run their [[race]], 
thy [[son]] ascanius, on this empty space, 
shall build a [[royal]] town, of lasting fame, 
which from this omen shall receive the name. 
time shall approve the [[truth]]. for what remains, 
and how with sure [[success]] to [[crown]] thy pains [[pain]], 
with patience next attend. a banish'd band, 
driv'n with evander from th' arcadian [[land]], 
have planted here, and plac'd on high their walls; 
their town the founder pallanteum calls, 
deriv'd from pallas, his great-grandsire's name: 
but the fierce latians old possession claim, 
with [[war]] infesting the new colony. 
these make thy [[friends]], and on their aid rely. 
to thy [[free]] passage i submit my streams. 
wake, [[son]] of [[venus]], from thy pleasing dreams [[dream]]; 
and, when the setting stars are lost in day, 
to juno's pow'r thy just devotion [[pay]]; 
with [[sacrifice]] the wrathful queen appease: 
her [[pride]] at length shall fall, her fury cease. 
when thou return'st victorious from the [[war]], 
perform thy vows to me with grateful [[care]]. 
the [[god]] am i, whose yellow water flows 
around these fields, and fattens as it goes: 
tiber my name; among the rolling floods 
renown'd on [[earth]], esteem'd among the gods. 
this is my [[certain]] seat. in times [[time]] to come, 
my waves shall wash the walls of mighty [[rome]]." 
he said, and plung'd below. while yet he spoke, 
his [[dream]] [[aeneas]] and his sleep forsook. 
he rose, and looking up, beheld the skies [[sky]] 
with purple blushing, and the day arise. 
then water in his hollow palm he took 
from tiber's flood, and thus the pow'rs bespoke: 
"laurentian nymphs [[nymph]], by whom the streams are fed, 
and [[father]] tiber, in thy [[sacred]] bed 
receive [[aeneas]], and from danger keep. 
whatever fount, whatever holy deep, 
conceals thy wat'ry stores; where'er they rise, 
and, bubbling from below, salute the skies [[sky]]; 
thou, [[king]] of horned floods, whose plenteous urn 
suffices fatness to the fruitful corn, 
for this thy [[kind]] compassion of our woes, 
shalt share my morning [[song]] and ev'ning vows. 
but, o be [[present]] to thy people's aid, 
and firm the gracious promise thou hast made!" 
thus having said, two galleys from his stores, 
with [[care]] he chooses, mans [[man]], and fits with oars. 
now on the shore the fatal swine is found. 
wondrous to tell!- she lay along the ground: 
her well-fed offspring at her udders hung; 
she [[white]] herself, and [[white]] her thirty [[young]]. 
aeneas takes the [[mother]] and her brood, 
and all on juno's altar are bestow'd. 
the foll'wing night, and the succeeding day, 
propitious tiber smooth'd his wat'ry way: 
he roll'd his river back, and pois'd he stood, 
a gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood. 
the trojans mount their ships; they put from shore, 
borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar. 
shouts from the [[land]] give omen to their course, 
and the pitch'd vessels glide with easy [[force]]. 
the woods and waters wonder at the gleam 
of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream. 
one summer's night and one whole day they pass 
betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass. 
the fiery sun had finish'd half his [[race]], 
look'd back, and doubted in the middle space, 
when they from far beheld the rising tow'rs, 
the tops of sheds, and shepherds' lowly bow'rs, 
thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay, 
now rise in marble, from the roman sway. 
these cots (evander's [[kingdom]], mean and poor) 
the trojan saw, and turn'd his ships to shore. 
't was on a solemn day: th' arcadian states, 
the [[king]] and [[prince]], without the [[city]] gates, 
then paid their off'rings in a [[sacred]] grove 
to hercules, the warrior [[son]] of jove. 
thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies [[sky]], 
and fat of entrails on his altar fries. 
but, when they saw the ships that stemm'd the flood, 
and glitter'd thro' the covert of the wood, 
they rose with [[fear]], and left th' unfinish'd feast, 
till dauntless pallas reassur'd the rest 
to [[pay]] the rites. himself without delay 
a jav'lin seiz'd, and singly took his way; 
then gain'd a rising ground, and call'd from far: 
"resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are; 
your bus'ness here; and bring you [[peace]] or [[war]]?" 
high on the stern [[aeneas]] his stand, 
and held a branch of olive in his hand, 
while thus he spoke: "the phrygians' arms you see, 
expell'd from troy, provok'd in [[italy]] 
by latian foes, with [[war]] unjustly made; 
at first affianc'd, and at [[last]] betray'd. 
this message bear: 'the trojans and their [[chief]] 
bring holy [[peace]], and beg the king's relief.' 
struck with so [[great]] a name, and all on [[fire]], 
the [[youth]] replies: "whatever you require, 
your fame exacts. upon our shores descend. 
a welcome guest, and, what you [[wish]], a friend." 
he said, and, downward hasting to the strand, 
embrac'd the stranger [[prince]], and join'd his hand. 
conducted to the grove, [[aeneas]] broke 
the [[silence]] first, and thus the [[king]] bespoke: 
"best of the greeks [[greek]], to whom, by fate's command, 
i bear these peaceful branches in my hand, 
undaunted i approach you, tho' i [[know]] 
your birth is grecian, and your [[land]] my foe; 
from atreus tho' your ancient lineage came, 
and both the [[brother]] kings [[king]] your kindred claim; 
yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown, 
your [[virtue]], thro' the neighb'ring nations blown, 
our fathers' mingled [[blood]], apollo's voice, 
have [[led]] me hither, less by need than [[choice]]. 
our founder dardanus, as fame has sung, 
and greeks [[greek]] acknowledge, from electra sprung: 
electra from the loins of atlas came; 
atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame. 
your sire is mercury, whom long before 
on cold cyllene's top [[fair]] maia bore. 
maia the [[fair]], on fame if we rely, 
was atlas' [[daughter]], who sustains the [[sky]]. 
thus from one [[common]] source our streams divide; 
ours is the trojan, yours th' areadian side. 
rais'd by these hopes [[hope]], i sent no news before, 
nor ask'd your leave, nor did your [[faith]] implore; 
but come, without a pledge, my own ambassador. 
the same rutulians, who with arms pursue 
the trojan [[race]], are [[equal]] foes to you. 
our host expell'd, what farther [[force]] can stay 
the victor [[troops]] from universal sway? 
then will they stretch their pow'r athwart the [[land]], 
and either sea from side to side command. 
receive our offer'd [[faith]], and give us thine; 
ours is a gen'rous and experienc'd line: 
we want not hearts [[heart]] nor bodies [[body]] for the [[war]]; 
in council cautious, and in fields we dare." 
he said; and while spoke, with piercing [[eyes]] 
evander view'd the [[man]] with vast surprise, 
pleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face: 
then answer'd briefly, with a [[royal]] grace: 
"o valiant leader of the trojan line, 
in whom the features of thy [[father]] shine, 
how i recall anchises! how i see 
his motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee! 
long tho' it be, 't is fresh within my [[mind]], 
when priam to his sister's court design'd 
a welcome visit, with a friendly stay, 
and thro' th' arcadian [[kingdom]] took his way. 
then, [[past]] a boy, the callow down began 
to shade my chin, and call me first a [[man]]. 
i saw the shining train with vast delight, 
and priam's goodly [[person]] pleas'd my sight: 
but [[great]] anchises, far above the rest, 
with awful wonder fir'd my youthful breast. 
i long'd to join in friendship's holy bands 
our mutual hearts [[heart]], and plight our mutual hands. 
i first accosted him: i sued, i sought, 
and, with a loving [[force]], to pheneus brought. 
he gave me, when at length constrain'd to go, 
a lycian quiver and a gnossian bow, 
a vest embroider'd, glorious to behold, 
and two [[rich]] bridles, with their bits of gold, 
which my son's coursers in [[obedience]] hold. 
the league you ask, i offer, as your [[right]]; 
and, when to-morrow's sun reveals the [[light]], 
with swift supplies you shall be sent away. 
now celebrate with us this solemn day, 
whose holy rites admit no long delay. 
honor our annual feast; and take your seat, 
with friendly welcome, at a homely treat." 
thus having said, the bowls (remov'd for fear) 
the youths [[youth]] replac'd, and soon restor'd the cheer. 
on sods of turf he set the soldiers round: 
a maple [[throne]], rais'd higher from the ground, 
receiv'd the trojan [[chief]]; and, o'er the bed, 
a lion's shaggy hide for ornament they spread. 
the loaves were serv'd in canisters; the wine 
in bowls; the [[priest]] renew'd the rites [[divine]]: 
broil'd entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine.

but when the rage of [[hunger]] was repress'd, 
thus spoke evander to his [[royal]] guest: 
"these rites, these altars, and this feast, o [[king]], 
from no [[vain]] fears [[fear]] or superstition spring, 
or blind devotion, or from blinder [[chance]], 
or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance; 
but, sav'd from danger, with a grateful sense, 
the labors of a [[god]] we recompense. 
see, from afar, yon rock that mates the [[sky]], 
about whose feet such heaps of rubbish [[lie]]; 
such indigested ruin; bleak and bare, 
how desart now it stands, expos'd in air! 
't was once a robber's den, inclos'd around 
with living stone, and deep beneath the ground. 
the monster cacus, more than half a beast, 
this hold, impervious to the sun, possess'd. 
the pavement ever foul with [[human]] gore; 
heads, and their mangled members, hung the door. 
vulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire, 
black clouds he belch'd, and flakes of livid [[fire]]. 
time, long expected, eas'd us of our load, 
and brought the needful presence of a [[god]]. 
th' avenging [[force]] of hercules, from [[spain]], 
arriv'd in triumph, from geryon slain: 
thrice liv'd the giant, and thrice liv'd in [[vain]]. 
his prize, the lowing herds, alcides drove 
near tiber's bank, to graze the shady grove. 
allur'd with [[hope]] of plunder, and intent 
by [[force]] to rob, by fraud to circumvent, 
the brutal cacus, as by [[chance]] they stray'd, 
four oxen thence, and four [[fair]] kine convey'd; 
and, lest the printed footsteps might be seen, 
he dragg'd 'em backwards to his rocky den. 
the tracks averse a lying notice gave, 
and [[led]] the searcher backward from the cave. 
"meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place, 
to find fresh pasture and untrodden grass. 
the beasts, who miss'd their mates, fill'd all around 
with bellowings, and the rocks restor'd the sound. 
one heifer, who had heard her [[love]] [[complain]], 
roar'd from the cave, and made the project [[vain]]. 
alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook, 
and toss'd about his head his knotted oak. 
swift as the winds, or scythian arrows' flight, 
he clomb, with eager haste, th' aerial height. 
then first we saw the monster mend his pace; 
fear his [[eyes]], and paleness in his face, 
confess'd the god's approach. trembling he springs, 
as terror had increas'd his feet with wings; 
nor stay'd for stairs; but down the depth he threw 
his [[body]], on his back the door he drew 
(the door, a rib of living rock; with pains [[pain]] 
his [[father]] hew'd it out, and bound with iron chains): 
he broke the heavy links, the mountain clos'd, 
and bars and levers to his foe oppos'd. 
the wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast; 
the fierce avenger came with bounding haste; 
survey'd the mouth of the forbidden hold, 
and here and there his raging [[eyes]] he roll'd. 
he gnash'd his teeth; and thrice he compass'd round 
with winged speed the circuit of the ground. 
thrice at the cavern's mouth he pull'd in [[vain]], 
and, panting, thrice desisted from his [[pain]]. 
a pointed flinty rock, all bare and black, 
grew gibbous from behind the mountain's back; 
owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night, 
here built their nests, and hither wing'd their flight. 
the leaning head hung threat'ning o'er the flood, 
and nodded to the left. the hero stood 
adverse, with planted feet, and, from the [[right]], 
tugg'd at the solid stone with all his might. 
thus heav'd, the fix'd foundations of the rock 
gave way; heav'n echo'd at the rattling shock. 
tumbling, it chok'd the flood: on either side 
the banks leap backward, and the streams divide; 
the [[sky]] shrunk upward with unusual dread, 
and trembling tiber div'd beneath his bed. 
the court of cacus stands reveal'd to sight; 
the cavern glares with new-admitted [[light]]. 
so the pent vapors, with a rumbling sound, 
heave from below, and rend the hollow ground; 
a sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high, 
the gods with hate beheld the nether [[sky]]: 
the ghosts repine at violated night, 
and curse th' invading sun, and sicken at the sight. 
the graceless monster, caught in open day, 
inclos'd, and in despair to fly away, 
howls horrible from underneath, and fills 
his hollow palace with unmanly yells. 
the hero stands above, and from afar 
plies him with darts, and stones, and distant [[war]]. 
he, from his nostrils huge mouth, expires 
black clouds of smoke, amidst his father's fires [[fire]], 
gath'ring, with each repeated blast, the night, 
to make uncertain aim, and erring sight. 
the wrathful [[god]] then plunges from above, 
and, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove, 
there lights [[light]]; and wades thro' fumes, and gropes his way,

half sing'd, half stifled, till he grasps his prey. 
the monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found; 
he squeez'd his throat; he writh'd his neck around, 
and in a knot his crippled members bound; 
then from their sockets tore his burning [[eyes]]: 
roll'd on a heap, the breathless robber lies [[lie]]. 
the doors, unbarr'd, receive the rushing day, 
and thoro' lights [[light]] disclose the ravish'd prey. 
the bulls, redeem'd, breathe open air again. 
next, by the feet, they drag him from his den. 
the wond'ring neighborhood, with glad surprise, 
behold his shagged breast, his giant size, 
his mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish'd [[eyes]].

from that auspicious day, with rites [[divine]], 
we [[worship]] at the hero's holy shrine. 
potitius first ordain'd these annual vows: 
as priests [[priest]], were added the pinarian house, 
who rais'd this altar in the [[sacred]] shade, 
where honors, ever due, for ever shall be paid. 
for these deserts, and this high [[virtue]] shown, 
ye warlike youths [[youth]], your heads with garlands [[crown]]: 
fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood, 
and with deep draughts invoke our [[common]] [[god]]." 
this said, a double wreath evander twin'd, 
and poplars black and [[white]] his temples bind. 
then brims his ample bowl. with like design 
the rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine. 
meantime the sun descended from the skies [[sky]], 
and the bright evening star began to rise. 
and now the priests [[priest]], potitius at their head, 
in skins of beasts involv'd, the long procession [[led]]; 
held high the flaming tapers in their hands, 
as custom had prescrib'd their holy bands; 
then with a second course the tables load, 
and with full chargers offer to the [[god]]. 
the salii sing, and cense his altars round 
with saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound- 
one choir of old, another of the [[young]], 
to dance, and bear the burthen of the [[song]]. 
the lay records the labors, and the [[praise]], 
and all th' [[immortal]] acts of hercules: 
first, how the mighty babe, when swath'd in bands, 
the serpents strangled with his infant hands; 
then, as in years and matchless [[force]] he grew, 
th' oechalian walls, and trojan, overthrew. 
besides, a thousand hazards they relate, 
procur'd by juno's and eurystheus' hate: 
"thy hands, unconquer'd hero, could subdue 
the cloud-born centaurs, and the monster crew: 
nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood, 
nor he, the roaring terror of the wood. 
the triple porter of the stygian seat, 
with lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet, 
and, seiz'd with [[fear]], forgot his mangled meat. 
th' infernal waters trembled at thy sight; 
thee, [[god]], no face of danger could affright; 
not huge typhoeus, nor th' unnumber'd snake, 
increas'd with hissing heads, in lerna's lake. 
hail, jove's undoubted son! an added grace 
to heav'n and the [[great]] author of thy race! 
receive the grateful off'rings which we [[pay]], 
and smile propitious on thy solemn day!" 
in numbers thus they sung; above the rest, 
the den and [[death]] of cacus [[crown]] the feast. 
the woods to hollow vales convey the sound, 
the vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound. 
the rites perform'd, the cheerful train retire. 
betwixt [[young]] pallas and his aged sire, 
the trojan pass'd, the [[city]] to survey, 
and pleasing talk beguil'd the tedious way. 
the stranger cast around his [[curious]] [[eyes]], 
new objects viewing still, with new surprise; 
with greedy joy enquires of various things, 
and acts and monuments of ancient kings [[king]]. 
then thus the founder of the roman tow'rs: 
"these woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs, 
of nymphs [[nymph]] and fauns, and salvage [[men]], who took 
their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak. 
nor laws [[law]] they knew, nor manners, nor the [[care]] 
of lab'ring oxen, or the shining share, 
nor [[arts]] of gain, nor what they gain'd to spare. 
their exercise the chase; the running flood 
supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food. 
then saturn came, who fled the pow'r of jove, 
robb'd of his realms, and banish'd from above. 
the [[men]], dispers'd on hills, to towns he brought, 
and laws [[law]] ordain'd, and civil customs taught, 
and latium call'd the [[land]] where safe he lay 
from his unduteous [[son]], and his usurping sway. 
with his mild [[empire]], [[peace]] and plenty came; 
and hence the golden times [[time]] deriv'd their name. 
a more degenerate and discolor'd [[age]] 
succeeded this, with avarice and rage. 
th' ausonians then, and bold sicanians came; 
and saturn's [[empire]] often chang'd the name. 
then kings [[king]], gigantic tybris, and the rest, 
with arbitrary sway the [[land]] oppress'd: 
for tiber's flood was albula before, 
till, from the tyrant's [[fate]], his name it bore. 
i [[last]] arriv'd, driv'n from my native [[home]] 
by fortune's pow'r, and fate's resistless doom. 
long toss'd on seas, i sought this [[happy]] [[land]], 
warn'd by my [[mother]] [[nymph]], and call'd by heav'n's command."

thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew'd the gate, 
since call'd carmental by the roman [[state]]; 
where stood an altar, [[sacred]] to the name 
of old carmenta, the prophetic dame, 
who to her [[son]] foretold th' aenean [[race]], 
sublime in fame, and rome's imperial place: 
then shews the forest, which, in after times [[time]], 
fierce romulus for perpetrated crimes 
a [[sacred]] refuge made; with this, the shrine 
where pan below the rock had rites [[divine]]: 
then tells of argus' [[death]], his murder'd guest, 
whose grave and tomb his innocence attest. 
thence, to the steep tarpeian rock he leads; 
now roof'd with gold, then thatch'd with homely reeds. 
a reverent [[fear]] (such superstition reigns 
among the rude) ev'n then possess'd the swains. 
some [[god]], they knew- what [[god]], they could not tell- 
did there amidst the [[sacred]] [[horror]] dwell. 
th' arcadians [[thought]] him jove; and said they saw 
the mighty thund'rer with majestic awe, 
who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around, 
and scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground. 
then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood 
two stately towns, on either side the flood,) 
saturnia's and janicula's remains; 
and either place the founder's name retains. 
discoursing thus together, they resort 
where [[poor]] evander kept his [[country]] court. 
they view'd the ground of rome's litigious hall; 
(once oxen low'd, where now the lawyers bawl;) 
then, stooping, thro' the narrow gate they press'd, 
when thus the [[king]] bespoke his trojan guest: 
"mean as it is, this palace, and this door, 
receiv'd alcides, then a conqueror. 
dare to be [[poor]]; accept our homely food, 
which feasted him, and emulate a [[god]]." 
then underneath a lowly roof he [[led]] 
the weary [[prince]], and laid him on a bed; 
the stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o'erspread. 
now night had shed her silver dews around, 
and with her sable wings embrac'd the ground, 
when love's [[fair]] [[goddess]], anxious for her [[son]], 
(new tumults rising, and new wars [[war]] begun,) 
couch'd with her husband in his golden bed, 
with these alluring words invokes his aid; 
and, that her pleasing [[speech]] his [[mind]] may move, 
inspires each accent with the charms of [[love]]: 
"while cruel [[fate]] conspir'd with grecian pow'rs, 
to level with the ground the trojan tow'rs, 
i ask'd not aid th' unhappy to restore, 
nor did the succor of thy [[skill]] implore; 
nor urg'd the labors of my [[lord]] in [[vain]], 
a sinking [[empire]] longer to sustain, 
tho'much i ow'd to priam's house, and more 
the dangers of [[aeneas]] did deplore. 
but now, by jove's command, and fate's decree, 
his [[race]] is doom'd to reign in [[italy]]: 
with humble suit i beg thy needful art [[arts]], 
o still propitious pow'r, that rules [[rule]] my heart! 
a [[mother]] kneels a suppliant for her [[son]]. 
by thetis and aurora thou wert won 
to forge impenetrable shields, and grace 
with fated arms a less illustrious [[race]]. 
behold, what haughty nations are combin'd 
against the relics of the phrygian [[kind]], 
with [[fire]] and [[sword]] my [[people]] to [[destroy]], 
and conquer [[venus]] twice, in conqu'ring troy." 
she said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue, 
about her unresolving husband threw. 
her soft embraces soon infuse [[desire]]; 
his bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire; 
and all the godhead feels [[feel]] the wonted [[fire]]. 
not half so swift the rattling thunder flies, 
or forky lightnings flash along the skies [[sky]]. 
the [[goddess]], proud of her successful wiles, 
and conscious of her form, in secret smiles. 
then thus the pow'r, obnoxious to her charms, 
panting, and half dissolving in her arms: 
"why seek you reasons [[reason]] for a cause so just, 
or your own beauties [[beauty]] or my [[love]] distrust? 
long since, had you requir'd my helpful hand, 
th' artificer and art [[arts]] you might command, 
to labor arms for troy: nor jove, nor [[fate]], 
confin'd their [[empire]] to so short a date. 
and, if you now [[desire]] new wars [[war]] to wage, 
my [[skill]] i promise, and my pains [[pain]] engage. 
whatever melting metals can conspire, 
or breathing bellows, or the forming [[fire]], 
is freely yours: your anxious fears [[fear]] remove, 
and [[think]] no task is difficult to [[love]]." 
trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms, 
he snatch'd the willing [[goddess]] to his arms; 
till in her lap infus'd, he lay possess'd 
of full [[desire]], and sunk to pleasing rest. 
now when the night her middle [[race]] had rode, 
and his first slumber had refresh'd the god- 
the [[time]] when early housewives leave the bed; 
when living embers on the hearth they spread, 
supply the lamp, and call the maids to rise- 
with yawning mouths, and with half-open'd [[eyes]], 
they ply the distaff by the winking [[light]], 
and to their daily labor add the night: 
thus frugally they earn their children's bread, 
and uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed- 
not less concern'd, nor at a later hour, 
rose from his downy couch the forging pow'r. 
sacred to vulcan's name, an isle there lay, 
betwixt sicilia's coasts and lipare, 
rais'd high on smoking rocks; and, deep below, 
in hollow caves the fires [[fire]] of aetna glow. 
the cyclops here their heavy hammers deal; 
loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel, 
are heard around; the boiling waters roar, 
and smoky flames thro' fuming tunnels soar. 
hether the [[father]] of the [[fire]], by night, 
thro' the brown air precipitates his flight. 
on their eternal anvils here he found 
the brethren [[brother]] beating, and the blows go round. 
a load of pointless thunder now there lies [[lie]] 
before their hands, to ripen for the skies [[sky]]: 
these darts, for angry jove, they daily cast; 
consum'd on mortals with prodigious waste. 
three rays of writhen rain, of [[fire]] three more, 
of winged southern winds and cloudy store 
as many parts, the dreadful mixture frame; 
and fears [[fear]] are added, and avenging flame. 
inferior ministers, for [[mars]], repair 
his broken axletrees and blunted [[war]], 
and send him forth again with furbish'd arms, 
to wake the lazy [[war]] with trumpets' loud alarms. 
the rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold 
the shield of pallas, and renew their gold. 
full on the crest the gorgon's head they place, 
with [[eyes]] that roll in [[death]], and with distorted face. 
"my sons [[son]]," said vulcan, "set your tasks aside; 
your [[strength]] and master-skill must now be tried. 
arms for a hero forge; arms that require 
your [[force]], your speed, and all your forming [[fire]]." 
he said. they set their former [[work]] aside, 
and their new toils with eager haste divide. 
a flood of molten silver, brass, and gold, 
and deadly steel, in the large furnace roll'd; 
of this, their artful hands a shield prepare, 
alone sufficient to sustain the [[war]]. 
sev'n orbs within a spacious round they close: 
one stirs the [[fire]], and one the bellows blows. 
the hissing steel is in the smithy drown'd; 
the grot with beaten anvils groans around. 
by turns their arms advance, in [[equal]] [[time]]; 
by turns their hands descend, and hammers chime. 
they turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs; 
the fiery [[work]] proceeds, with rustic songs [[song]]. 
while, at the lemnian god's command, they urge 
their labors thus, and ply th' aeolian forge, 
the cheerful morn salutes evander's [[eyes]], 
and songs [[song]] of chirping birds invite to rise. 
he leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet 
above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet: 
he sets his trusty [[sword]] upon his side, 
and o'er his shoulder throws a panther's hide. 
two menial dogs before their master press'd. 
thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest. 
mindful of promis'd aid, he mends his pace, 
but meets [[aeneas]] in the middle space. 
young pallas did his father's steps attend, 
and true achates waited on his friend. 
they join their hands; a secret seat they choose; 
th' arcadian first their former talk renews: 
"undaunted [[prince]], i never can [[believe]] 
the trojan [[empire]] lost, while you survive. 
command th' assistance of a faithful friend; 
but feeble are the succors i can send. 
our narrow [[kingdom]] here the tiber bounds; 
that other side the latian [[state]] surrounds, 
insults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds. 
but mighty nations i prepare, to join 
their arms with yours, and aid your just design. 
you come, as by your [[better]] genius sent, 
and [[fortune]] seems to favor your intent. 
not far from hence there stands a hilly town, 
of ancient building, and of high renown, 
torn from the tuscans by the lydian [[race]], 
who gave the name of caere to the place, 
once agyllina call'd. it flourish'd long, 
in [[pride]] of [[wealth]] and warlike [[people]] [[strong]], 
till curs'd mezentius, in a fatal hour, 
assum'd the [[crown]], with arbitrary pow'r. 
what words can paint those execrable times [[time]], 
the subjects' suff'rings, and the tyrant's crimes! 
that [[blood]], those murthers, o ye gods, replace 
on his own head, and on his impious race! 
the living and the [[dead]] at his command 
were coupled, face to face, and hand to hand, 
till, chok'd with stench, in loath'd embraces tied, 
the ling'ring wretches pin'd away and died. 
thus plung'd in ills, and meditating more- 
the people's patience, tir'd, no longer bore 
the raging monster; but with arms beset 
his house, and vengeance and destruction threat. 
they [[fire]] his palace: while the flame ascends, 
they [[force]] his guards, and execute his [[friends]]. 
he cleaves the crowd, and, favor'd by the night, 
to turnus' friendly court directs his flight. 
by just [[revenge]] the tuscans set on [[fire]], 
with arms, their [[king]] to [[punishment]] require: 
their num'rous [[troops]], now muster'd on the strand, 
my counsel shall submit to your command. 
their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry 
to hoist their anchors, but the gods deny. 
an ancient augur, skill'd in future [[fate]], 
with these foreboding words restrains their hate: 
'ye brave in arms, ye lydian [[blood]], the flow'r 
of tuscan [[youth]], and [[choice]] of all their pow'r, 
whom just [[revenge]] against mezentius arms, 
to seek your tyrant's [[death]] by lawful arms; 
know this: no native of our [[land]] may lead 
this pow'rful [[people]]; seek a [[foreign]] head.' 
aw'd with these words, in camps they still abide, 
and wait with longing looks their promis'd guide. 
tarchon, the tuscan [[chief]], to me has sent 
their [[crown]], and ev'ry regal ornament: 
the [[people]] join their own with his [[desire]]; 
and all my conduct, as their [[king]], require. 
but the chill [[blood]] that creeps within my veins, 
and [[age]], and listless limbs unfit for pains [[pain]], 
and a [[soul]] conscious of its own decay, 
have forc'd me to refuse imperial sway. 
my pallas were more fit to mount the [[throne]], 
and should, but he's a sabine mother's [[son]], 
and half a native; but, in you, combine 
a manly vigor, and a [[foreign]] line. 
where [[fate]] and smiling [[fortune]] shew the way, 
pursue the ready path to sov'reign sway. 
the staff of my declining days, my [[son]], 
shall make your [[good]] or ill [[success]] his own; 
in fighting fields from you shall learn to dare, 
and serve the hard apprenticeship of [[war]]; 
your matchless [[courage]] and your conduct view, 
and early shall begin t' [[admire]] and copy you. 
besides, two hundred horse he shall command; 
tho' few, a warlike and well-chosen band. 
these in my name are listed; and my [[son]] 
as many more has added in his own." 
scarce had he said; achates and his guest, 
with downcast [[eyes]], their silent [[grief]] express'd; 
who, short of succors, and in deep despair, 
shook at the dismal prospect of the [[war]]. 
but his bright [[mother]], from a breaking cloud, 
to cheer her issue, thunder'd thrice aloud; 
thrice forky lightning flash'd along the [[sky]], 
and tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high. 
then, gazing up, repeated peals they hear; 
and, in a heav'n serene, refulgent arms appear: 
redd'ning the skies [[sky]], and glitt'ring all around, 
the temper'd metals clash, and yield a silver sound. 
the rest stood trembling, struck with awe [[divine]]; 
aeneas only, conscious to the sign, 
presag'd th' event, and joyful view'd, above, 
th' accomplish'd promise of the queen of [[love]]. 
then, to th' arcadian [[king]]: "this prodigy 
(dismiss your fear) belongs alone to me. 
heav'n calls me to the [[war]]: th' expected sign 
is giv'n of promis'd aid, and arms [[divine]]. 
my [[goddess]] [[mother]], whose indulgent [[care]] 
foresaw the dangers of the growing [[war]], 
this omen gave, when bright vulcanian arms, 
fated from [[force]] of steel by stygian charms, 
suspended, shone on high: she then foreshow'd 
approaching fights, and fields to float in [[blood]]. 
turnus shall dearly [[pay]] for [[faith]] forsworn; 
and corps, and swords [[sword]], and shields, on tiber borne, 
shall choke his flood: now sound the loud alarms; 
and, latian [[troops]], prepare your perjur'd arms." 
he said, and, rising from his homely [[throne]], 
the solemn rites of hercules begun, 
and on his altars wak'd the sleeping fires [[fire]]; 
then cheerful to his household gods retires; 
there offers chosen sheep. th' arcadian [[king]] 
and trojan [[youth]] the same oblations bring. 
next, of his [[men]] and ships he makes review; 
draws out the [[best]] and ablest of the crew. 
down with the falling stream the refuse run, 
to raise with joyful news his drooping [[son]]. 
steeds are prepar'd to mount the trojan band, 
who wait their leader to the tyrrhene [[land]]. 
a sprightly courser, fairer than the rest, 
the [[king]] himself presents [[present]] his [[royal]] guest: 
a lion's hide his back and limbs infold, 
precious with studded [[work]], and paws of gold. 
fame thro' the little [[city]] spreads aloud 
th' intended march, amid the fearful crowd: 
the matrons beat their breasts, dissolve in tears, 
and double their devotion in their fears [[fear]]. 
the [[war]] at hand appears with more affright, 
and rises ev'ry moment to the sight. 
then old evander, with a close embrace, 
strain'd his departing friend; and tears o'erflow his face.

"would heav'n," said he, "my [[strength]] and [[youth]] recall, 
such as i was beneath praeneste's wall; 
then when i made the foremost foes retire, 
and set whole heaps of conquer'd shields on [[fire]]; 
when herilus in [[single]] [[fight]] i slew, 
whom with three lives [[life]] feronia did endue; 
and thrice i sent him to the stygian shore, 
till the [[last]] ebbing [[soul]] return'd no more- 
such if i stood renew'd, not these alarms, 
nor [[death]], should rend me from my pallas' arms; 
nor proud mezentius, thus unpunish'd, boast 
his rapes and murthers on the tuscan coast. 
ye gods, and mighty jove, in [[pity]] bring 
relief, and hear a [[father]] and a king! 
if [[fate]] and you reserve these [[eyes]], to see 
my [[son]] return with [[peace]] and [[victory]]; 
if the lov'd boy shall bless his father's sight; 
if we shall meet again with more delight; 
then draw my [[life]] in length; let me sustain, 
in hopes [[hope]] of his embrace, the worst of [[pain]]. 
but if your hard decrees- which, o! i dread- 
have doom'd to [[death]] his undeserving head; 
this, o this very moment, let me die! 
while hopes [[hope]] and fears [[fear]] in [[equal]] balance [[lie]]; 
while, yet possess'd of all his youthful charms, 
i strain him close within these aged arms; 
before that fatal news my [[soul]] shall wound!" 
he said, and, swooning, sunk upon the ground. 
his servants bore him off, and softly laid 
his languish'd limbs upon his homely bed. 
the horsemen march; the gates are open'd wide; 
aeneas at their head, achates by his side. 
next these, the trojan leaders rode along; 
last follows in the rear th' arcadian throng. 
young pallas shone conspicuous o'er the rest; 
gilded his arms, embroider'd was his vest. 
so, from the seas, exerts his radiant head 
the star by whom the lights [[light]] of heav'n are [[led]]; 
shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews, 
dispels the darkness, and the day renews. 
the trembling wives [[wife]] the walls and turrets crowd, 
and [[follow]], with their [[eyes]], the dusty cloud, 
which winds disperse by fits, and shew from far 
the blaze of arms, and shields, and shining [[war]]. 
the [[troops]], drawn up in beautiful array, 
o'er heathy plains pursue the ready way. 
repeated peals of shouts are heard around; 
the neighing coursers [[answer]] to the sound, 
and shake with horny hoofs the solid ground. 
a greenwood shade, for long [[religion]] known, 
stands by the streams that wash the tuscan town, 
incompass'd round with gloomy hills above, 
which add a holy [[horror]] to the grove. 
the first inhabitants of grecian [[blood]], 
that [[sacred]] forest to silvanus vow'd, 
the guardian of their flocks and fields; and [[pay]] 
their due devotions on his annual day. 
not far from hence, along the river's side, 
in tents secure, the tuscan [[troops]] abide, 
by tarchon [[led]]. now, from a rising ground, 
aeneas cast his wond'ring [[eyes]] around, 
and all the tyrrhene [[army]] had in sight, 
stretch'd on the spacious plain from left to [[right]]. 
thether his warlike train the trojan [[led]], 
refresh'd his [[men]], and wearied horses fed. 
meantime the [[mother]] [[goddess]], crown'd with charms, 
breaks thro' the clouds, and brings the fated arms. 
within a winding vale she finds her [[son]], 
on the cool river's banks, retir'd alone. 
she shews her heav'nly form without [[disguise]], 
and gives herself to his desiring [[eyes]]. 
"behold," she said, "perform'd in ev'ry part, 
my promise made, and vulcan's labor'd art [[arts]]. 
now seek, secure, the latian [[enemy]], 
and haughty turnus to the field defy." 
she said; and, having first her [[son]] embrac'd, 
the radiant arms beneath an oak she plac'd, 
proud of the gift, he roll'd his greedy sight 
around the [[work]], and gaz'd with vast delight. 
he lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires 
the crested helm, that vomits radiant fires [[fire]]: 
his hands the fatal [[sword]] and corslet hold, 
one keen with temper'd steel, one stiff with gold: 
both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright; 
so shines a cloud, when edg'd with adverse [[light]]. 
he shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try 
the plated cuishes on his manly thigh; 
but most admires the shield's mysterious mold, 
and roman triumphs rising on the gold: 
for these, emboss'd, the heav'nly smith had wrought 
(not in the rolls of future [[fate]] untaught) 
the wars [[war]] in order, and the [[race]] [[divine]] 
of warriors issuing from the julian line. 
the cave of [[mars]] was dress'd with mossy greens: 
there, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins. 
intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung; 
the foster dam loll'd out her fawning tongue: 
they suck'd secure, while, bending back her head, 
she lick'd their tender limbs, and form'd them as they fed.

not far from thence new [[rome]] appears, with games 
projected for the rape of sabine dames. 
the pit resounds with shrieks; a [[war]] succeeds, 
for breach of [[public]] [[faith]], and unexampled deeds. 
here for [[revenge]] the sabine [[troops]] contend; 
the romans there with arms the prey defend. 
wearied with tedious [[war]], at length they cease; 
and both the kings [[king]] and kingdoms [[kingdom]] plight the [[peace]]. 
the friendly chiefs [[chief]] before jove's altar stand, 
both arm'd, with each a charger in his hand: 
a fatted sow for [[sacrifice]] is [[led]], 
with imprecations on the perjur'd head. 
near this, the traitor metius, stretch'd between 
four fiery steeds, is dragg'd along the green, 
by tullus' doom: the brambles drink his [[blood]], 
and his torn limbs are left the vulture's food. 
there, porsena to [[rome]] proud tarquin brings, 
and would by [[force]] restore the banish'd kings [[king]]. 
one [[tyrant]] for his fellow-tyrant fights; 
the roman [[youth]] assert their native rights [[right]]. 
before the town the tuscan [[army]] lies [[lie]], 
to [[win]] by famine, or by fraud surprise. 
their [[king]], half-threat'ning, half-disdaining stood, 
while cocles broke the bridge, and stemm'd the flood. 
the captive maids there tempt the raging tide, 
scap'd from their chains, with cloelia for their guide. 
high on a rock heroic manlius stood, 
to guard the temple, and the temple's [[god]]. 
then [[rome]] was [[poor]]; and there you might behold 
the palace thatch'd with straw, now roof'd with gold. 
the silver goose before the shining gate 
there flew, and, by her cackle, sav'd the [[state]]. 
she told the gauls' approach; th' approaching gauls, 
obscure in night, ascend, and seize the walls. 
the gold dissembled well their yellow hair, 
and golden chains on their [[white]] necks they wear. 
gold are their vests; long alpine spears they wield, 
and their left arm sustains a length of shield. 
hard by, the leaping salian priests [[priest]] advance; 
and naked thro' the streets the mad luperci dance, 
in caps of wool; the targets dropp'd from heav'n. 
here modest matrons, in soft litters driv'n, 
to [[pay]] their vows in solemn pomp appear, 
and odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear. 
far hence remov'd, the stygian seats are seen; 
pains of the damn'd, and punish'd catiline 
hung on a rock- the traitor; and, around, 
the furies hissing from the nether ground. 
apart from these, the [[happy]] souls [[soul]] he draws, 
and cato's holy ghost dispensing laws [[law]]. 
betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea; 
but foaming surges there in silver play. 
the dancing dolphins with their tails divide 
the glitt'ring waves, and cut the precious tide. 
amid the main, two mighty fleets engage 
their brazen beaks, oppos'd with [[equal]] rage. 
actium surveys the well-disputed prize; 
leucate's wat'ry plain with foamy billows fries. 
young caesar, on the stern, in armor bright, 
here leads the romans and their gods to [[fight]]: 
his beamy temples shoot their flames afar, 
and o'er his head is hung the julian star. 
agrippa seconds him, with prosp'rous gales, 
and, with propitious gods, his foes assails: 
a naval [[crown]], that binds his manly brows, 
the [[happy]] [[fortune]] of the [[fight]] foreshows. 
rang'd on the line oppos'd, antonius brings 
barbarian aids, and [[troops]] of eastern kings [[king]]; 
th' arabians near, and bactrians from afar, 
of tongues discordant, and a mingled [[war]]: 
and, [[rich]] in gaudy robes, amidst the strife, 
his ill [[fate]] follows him- th' egyptian [[wife]]. 
moving they [[fight]]; with oars and forky prows 
the froth is gather'd, and the water glows. 
it seems, as if the cyclades again 
were rooted up, and justled in the main; 
or floating mountains floating mountains meet; 
such is the fierce encounter of the fleet. 
fireballs are thrown, and pointed jav'lins fly; 
the fields of [[neptune]] take a purple dye. 
the queen herself, amidst the loud alarms, 
with cymbals toss'd her fainting soldiers warms- 
fool as she was! who had not yet divin'd 
her cruel [[fate]], nor saw the snakes behind. 
her [[country]] gods, the monsters of the [[sky]], 
great [[neptune]], pallas, and love's queen defy: 
the dog anubis barks, but barks in [[vain]], 
nor longer dares oppose th' ethereal train. 
mars in the middle of the shining shield 
is grav'd, and strides along the liquid field. 
the dirae souse from heav'n with swift descent; 
and discord, dyed in [[blood]], with garments rent, 
divides the prease: her steps bellona treads, 
and shakes her iron rod above their heads. 
this seen, [[apollo]], from his actian height, 
pours down his arrows; at whose winged flight 
the trembling indians [[indian]] and [[egyptians]] yield, 
and soft sabaeans quit the wat'ry field. 
the fatal mistress hoists her silken sails, 
and, shrinking from the [[fight]], invokes the gales. 
aghast she looks, and heaves her breast for breath, 
panting, and pale with [[fear]] of future [[death]]. 
the [[god]] had figur'd her as driv'n along 
by winds and waves, and scudding thro' the throng. 
just opposite, [[sad]] nilus opens wide 
his arms and ample bosom to the tide, 
and spreads his mantle o'er the winding coast, 
in which he wraps his queen, and hides the flying host. 
the victor to the gods his thanks express'd, 
and [[rome]], triumphant, with his presence bless'd. 
three hundred temples in the town he plac'd; 
with spoils and altars ev'ry temple grac'd. 
three shining nights, and three succeeding days, 
the fields resound with shouts, the streets with [[praise]],

the domes with songs [[song]], the theaters with plays. 
all altars flame: before each altar lies [[lie]], 
drench'd in his gore, the destin'd [[sacrifice]]. 
great caesar sits sublime upon his [[throne]], 
before apollo's porch of parian stone; 
accepts the presents [[present]] vow'd for [[victory]], 
and hangs the monumental crowns [[crown]] on high. 
vast crowds of vanquish'd nations march along, 
various in arms, in habit, and in tongue. 
here, mulciber assigns the proper place 
for carians, and th' ungirt numidian [[race]]; 
then ranks the thracians in the second row, 
with scythians, expert in the dart and bow. 
and here the tam'd euphrates humbly glides, 
and there the rhine submits her swelling tides, 
and proud araxes, whom no bridge could bind; 
the danes' unconquer'd offspring march behind, 
and morini, the [[last]] of humankind. 
these figures, on the shield divinely wrought, 
by vulcan labor'd, and by [[venus]] brought, 
with joy and wonder fill the hero's [[thought]]. 
unknown the names, he yet admires the grace, 
and bears aloft the fame and [[fortune]] of his [[race]]. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book ix

while these affairs in distant places pass'd, 
the various iris juno sends with haste, 
to find bold turnus, who, with anxious [[thought]], 
the secret shade of his [[great]] grandsire sought. 
retir'd alone she found the daring [[man]], 
and op'd her rosy lips, and thus began: 
"what none of all the gods could grant thy vows, 
that, turnus, this auspicious day bestows. 
aeneas, gone to seek th' arcadian [[prince]], 
has left the trojan camp without defense; 
and, short of succors there, employs his pains [[pain]] 
in parts remote to raise the tuscan swains. 
now snatch an hour that favors thy designs; 
unite thy forces [[force]], and attack their lines." 
this said, on [[equal]] wings she pois'd her weight, 
and form'd a radiant rainbow in her flight. 
the daunian hero lifts his hands [[eyes]], 
and thus invokes the [[goddess]] as she flies: 
"iris, the grace of heav'n, what pow'r [[divine]] 
has sent thee down, thro' dusky clouds to shine? 
see, they divide; [[immortal]] day appears, 
and glitt'ring planets dancing in their spheres! 
with joy, these [[happy]] omens i obey, 
and [[follow]] to the [[war]] the [[god]] that leads the way." 
thus having said, as by the brook he stood, 
he scoop'd the water from the crystal flood; 
then with his hands the drops to heav'n he throws, 
and loads the pow'rs above with offer'd vows. 
now march the bold confed'rates thro' the plain, 
well hors'd, well clad; a [[rich]] and shining train. 
messapus leads the van; and, in the rear, 
the sons [[son]] of tyrrheus in bright arms appear. 
in the main [[battle]], with his flaming crest, 
the mighty turnus tow'rs above the rest. 
silent they move, majestically slow, 
like ebbing nile, or ganges in his flow. 
the trojans view the dusty cloud from far, 
and the dark menace of the distant [[war]]. 
caicus from the rampire saw it rise, 
black'ning the fields, and thick'ning thro' the skies [[sky]]. 
then to his fellows thus aloud he calls: 
"what rolling clouds, my [[friends]], approach the walls? 
arm! arm! and [[man]] the works! prepare your spears 
and pointed darts! the latian host appears." 
thus warn'd, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend 
the bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend: 
for their [[wise]] gen'ral, with foreseeing [[care]], 
had charg'd them not to tempt the doubtful [[war]], 
nor, tho' provok'd, in open fields advance, 
but close within their lines attend their [[chance]]. 
unwilling, yet they keep the strict command, 
and sourly wait in arms the hostile band. 
the fiery turnus flew before the rest: 
a piebald steed of thracian strain he press'd; 
his helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest. 
with twenty horse to second his designs, 
an unexpected foe, he fac'd the lines. 
"is there," he said, "in arms, who bravely dare 
his leader's [[honor]] and his danger share?" 
then spurring on, his brandish'd dart he threw, 
in sign of [[war]]: applauding shouts ensue. 
amaz'd to find a dastard [[race]], that run 
behind the rampires and the [[battle]] shun, 
he rides around the camp, with rolling [[eyes]], 
and stops at ev'ry post, and ev'ry passage tries. 
so roams the nightly wolf about the fold: 
wet with descending show'rs, and stiff with cold, 
he howls for [[hunger]], and he grins for [[pain]], 
(his gnashing teeth are exercis'd in [[vain]],) 
and, impotent of anger, finds no way 
in his distended paws to grasp the prey. 
the mothers [[mother]] listen; but the bleating lambs 
securely swig the dug, beneath the dams. 
thus ranges eager turnus o'er the plain. 
sharp with [[desire]], and furious with disdain; 
surveys each passage with a piercing sight, 
to [[force]] his foes in [[equal]] field to [[fight]]. 
thus while he gazes round, at length he spies, 
where, fenc'd with [[strong]] redoubts, their navy lies [[lie]], 
close underneath the walls; the washing tide 
secures from all approach this weaker side. 
he takes the wish'd [[occasion]], fills his hand 
with ready fires [[fire]], and shakes a flaming brand. 
urg'd by his presence, ev'ry [[soul]] is warm'd, 
and ev'ry hand with kindled firs is arm'd. 
from the fir'd pines the scatt'ring sparkles fly; 
fat vapors, mix'd with flames, involve the [[sky]]. 
what pow'r, o muses, could avert the flame 
which threaten'd, in the fleet, the trojan name? 
tell: for the [[fact]], thro' length of [[time]] obscure, 
is hard to [[faith]]; yet shall the fame endure. 
't is said that, when the [[chief]] prepar'd his flight, 
and fell'd his timber from mount ida's height, 
the grandam [[goddess]] then approach'd her [[son]], 
and with a mother's majesty begun: 
"grant me," she said, "the sole request i bring, 
since conquer'd heav'n has own'd you for its [[king]]. 
on ida's brows, for ages [[age]] [[past]], there stood, 
with firs and maples fill'd, a shady wood; 
and on the summit rose a [[sacred]] grove, 
where i was worship'd with [[religious]] [[love]]. 
those woods, that holy grove, my long delight, 
i gave the trojan [[prince]], to speed his flight. 
now, fill'd with [[fear]], on their behalf i come; 
let neither winds o'erset, nor waves intomb 
the floating forests of the [[sacred]] pine; 
but let it be their safety to be mine." 
then thus replied her awful [[son]], who rolls 
the radiant stars, and heav'n and [[earth]] controls: 
"how dare you, [[mother]], endless date demand 
for vessels molded by a mortal hand? 
what then is [[fate]]? shall bold [[aeneas]] ride, 
of safety [[certain]], on th' uncertain tide? 
yet, what i can, i grant; when, wafted o'er, 
the [[chief]] is landed on the latian shore, 
whatever ships escape the raging storms, 
at my command shall [[change]] their fading forms 
to nymphs [[nymph]] [[divine]], and plow the wat'ry way, 
like dotis and the daughters [[daughter]] of the sea." 
to seal his [[sacred]] vow, by styx he swore, 
the lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore, 
and phlegethon's innavigable flood, 
and the black regions of his [[brother]] [[god]]. 
he said; and shook the skies [[sky]] with his imperial nod. 
and now at length the number'd hours were come, 
prefix'd by fate's irrevocable doom, 
when the [[great]] [[mother]] of the gods was [[free]] 
to save her ships, and finish jove's decree. 
first, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung 
a [[light]] that sign'd the heav'ns, and shot along; 
then from a cloud, fring'd round with golden fires [[fire]], 
were timbrels heard, and berecynthian choirs; 
and, [[last]], a voice, with more than mortal sounds, 
both hosts, in arms oppos'd, with [[equal]] [[horror]] wounds: 
"o trojan [[race]], your needless aid forbear, 
and [[know]], my ships are my peculiar [[care]]. 
with greater ease the bold rutulian may, 
with hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea, 
than singe my [[sacred]] pines. but you, my charge, 
loos'd from your crooked anchors, launch at large, 
exalted each a [[nymph]]: forsake the sand, 
and swim the seas, at cybele's command." 
no sooner had the [[goddess]] ceas'd to speak, 
when, lo! th' [[obedient]] ships their haulsers break; 
and, [[strange]] to tell, like dolphins, in the main 
they plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again: 
as many beauteous maids the billows sweep, 
as rode before tall vessels on the deep. 
the foes, surpris'd with wonder, stood aghast; 
messapus curb'd his fiery courser's haste; 
old tiber roar'd, and, raising up his head, 
call'd back his waters to their oozy bed. 
turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock, 
and with these words his trembling [[troops]] bespoke: 
"these monsters for the trojans' [[fate]] are meant, 
and are by jove for black presages sent. 
he takes the cowards' [[last]] relief away; 
for fly they cannot, and, constrain'd to stay, 
must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey. 
the liquid half of all the globe is lost; 
heav'n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast. 
theirs is no more than that small spot of ground 
which myriads of our martial [[men]] surround. 
their fates [[fate]] i [[fear]] not, or [[vain]] oracles. 
't was giv'n to [[venus]] they should cross the seas, 
and [[land]] secure upon the latian plains: 
their promis'd hour is pass'd, and mine remains. 
't is in the [[fate]] of turnus to [[destroy]], 
with [[sword]] and [[fire]], the faithless [[race]] of troy. 
shall such affronts as these alone inflame 
the grecian brothers [[brother]], and the grecian name? 
my cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife, 
and final ruin, for a ravish'd [[wife]]. 
was 't not enough, that, punish'd for the crime, 
they fell; but will they fall a second [[time]]? 
one would have [[thought]] they paid enough before, 
to curse the costly [[sex]], and durst offend no more. 
can they securely trust their feeble wall, 
a slight partition, a thin interval, 
betwixt their [[fate]] and them; when troy, tho' built 
by hands [[divine]], yet perish'd by their guilt? 
lend me, for once, my [[friends]], your valiant hands, 
to [[force]] from out their lines these dastard bands. 
less than a thousand ships will end this [[war]], 
nor vulcan needs his fated arms prepare. 
let all the tuscans, all th' arcadians, join! 
nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design. 
let them not [[fear]] the treasons of the night, 
the robb'd palladium, the pretended flight: 
our onset shall be made in open [[light]]. 
no wooden engine shall their town betray; 
fires they shall have around, but fires [[fire]] by day. 
no grecian babes before their camp appear, 
whom hector's arms detain'd to the tenth tardy year. 
now, since the sun is rolling to the west, 
give we the silent night to needful rest: 
refresh your bodies [[body]], and your arms prepare; 
the morn shall end the small remains of [[war]]." 
the post of [[honor]] to messapus falls, 
to keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls, 
to pitch the fires [[fire]] at distances around, 
and close the trojans in their scanty ground. 
twice seven rutulian captains ready stand, 
and twice seven hundred horse these chiefs [[chief]] command; 
all clad in shining arms the works [[work]] invest, 
each with a radiant helm and waving crest. 
stretch'd at their length, they press the grassy ground;

they laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,) 
with lights [[light]] and cheerful fires [[fire]] renew the day, 
and pass the wakeful night in feasts and play. 
the trojans, from above, their foes beheld, 
and with arm'd legions all the rampires fill'd. 
seiz'd with affright, their gates they first explore; 
join works [[work]] to works [[work]] with bridges, tow'r to tow'r: 
thus all things needful for defense abound. 
mnestheus and brave seresthus walk the round, 
commission'd by their absent [[prince]] to share 
the [[common]] danger, and divide the [[care]]. 
the soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall, 
by turns relieve each other on the wall. 
nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance, 
to watch the gate was warlike nisus' [[chance]]. 
his [[father]] hyrtacus of [[noble]] [[blood]]; 
his [[mother]] was a huntress of the wood, 
and sent him to the wars [[war]]. well could he bear 
his lance in [[fight]], and dart the flying spear, 
but [[better]] skill'd unerring shafts to send. 
beside him stood euryalus, his friend: 
euryalus, than whom the trojan host 
no fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast- 
scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun. 
one was their [[care]], and their delight was one: 
one [[common]] hazard in the [[war]] they shar'd, 
and now were both by [[choice]] upon the guard. 
then nisus thus: "or do the gods inspire 
this warmth, or make we gods of our [[desire]]? 
a gen'rous ardor boils within my breast, 
eager of action, [[enemy]] to rest: 
this urges me to [[fight]], and fires [[fire]] my [[mind]] 
to leave a memorable name behind. 
thou see'st the foe secure; how faintly shine 
their scatter'd fires! the most, in sleep supine 
along the ground, an easy [[conquest]] [[lie]]: 
the wakeful few the fuming flagon ply; 
all hush'd around. now hear what i revolve- 
a [[thought]] unripe- and scarcely yet resolve. 
our absent [[prince]] both camp and council mourn; 
by message both would hasten his return: 
if they confer what i demand on thee, 
(for fame is recompense enough for me,) 
methinks, beneath yon hill, i have espied 
a way that safely will my passage guide." 
euryalus stood list'ning while he spoke, 
with [[love]] of [[praise]] and [[noble]] envy struck; 
then to his ardent friend expos'd his [[mind]]: 
"all this, alone, and leaving me behind! 
am i unworthy, nisus, to be join'd? 
thinkist thou i can my share of [[glory]] yield, 
or send thee unassisted to the field? 
not so my [[father]] taught my [[childhood]] arms; 
born in a siege, and bred among alarms! 
nor is my [[youth]] unworthy of my friend, 
nor of the heav'n-born hero i attend. 
the thing call'd [[life]], with ease i can disclaim, 
and [[think]] it over-sold to purchase fame." 
then nisus thus: "alas! thy tender years 
would minister new matter to my fears [[fear]]. 
so may the gods, who view this friendly strife, 
restore me to thy lov'd embrace with [[life]], 
condemn'd to [[pay]] my vows, (as sure i trust,) 
this thy request is cruel and [[unjust]]. 
but if some chance- as many chances [[chance]] are, 
and doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war- 
if one should reach my head, there let it fall, 
and spare thy [[life]]; i would not perish all. 
thy bloomy [[youth]] deserves a longer date: 
live thou to mourn thy love's unhappy [[fate]]; 
to bear my mangled [[body]] from the foe, 
or buy it back, and fun'ral rites bestow. 
or, if hard [[fortune]] shall those dues deny, 
thou canst at least an empty tomb supply. 
o let not me the widow's tears renew! 
nor let a mother's curse my name pursue: 
thy pious parent, who, for [[love]] of thee, 
forsook the coasts of friendly sicily, 
her [[age]] committing to the seas and wind, 
when ev'ry weary matron stay'd behind." 
to this, euryalus: "you plead in [[vain]], 
and but protract the cause you cannot gain. 
no more delays, but haste!" with that, he wakes 
the nodding watch; each to his office takes. 
the guard reliev'd, the gen'rous couple went 
to find the council at the [[royal]] tent. 
all creatures else forgot their daily [[care]], 
and sleep, the [[common]] gift of [[nature]], share; 
except the trojan peers, who wakeful sate 
in nightly council for th' indanger'd [[state]]. 
they vote a message to their absent [[chief]], 
shew their distress, and beg a swift relief. 
amid the camp a silent seat they chose, 
remote from clamor, and secure from foes. 
on their left arms their ample shields they bear, 
the [[right]] reclin'd upon the bending spear. 
now nisus and his friend approach the guard, 
and beg admission, eager to be heard: 
th' affair important, not to be deferr'd. 
ascanius bids 'em be conducted in, 
ord'ring the more experienc'd to begin. 
then nisus thus: "ye fathers [[father]], lend your ears; 
nor [[judge]] our bold attempt beyond our years. 
the foe, securely drench'd in sleep and wine, 
neglect their watch; the fires [[fire]] but thinly shine; 
and where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies, 
cov'ring the plain, and curling to the skies [[sky]], 
betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide, 
close by the sea, a passage we have spied, 
which will our way to [[great]] [[aeneas]] guide. 
expect each hour to see him safe again, 
loaded with spoils of foes in [[battle]] slain. 
snatch we the lucky minute while we may; 
nor can we be mistaken in the way; 
for, hunting in the vale, we both have seen 
the rising turrets, and the stream between, 
and [[know]] the winding course, with ev'ry ford." 
he ceas'd; and old alethes took the word: 
"our [[country]] gods, in whom our trust we place, 
will yet from ruin save the trojan [[race]], 
while we behold such dauntless worth appear 
in dawning [[youth]], and souls [[soul]] so void of [[fear]]." 
then into tears of joy the [[father]] broke; 
each in his longing arms by turns he took; 
panted and paus'd; and thus again he spoke: 
"ye brave [[young]] [[men]], what [[equal]] gifts can we, 
in recompense of such desert, decree? 
the [[greatest]], sure, and [[best]] you can receive, 
the gods and your own conscious worth will give. 
the rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow, 
and [[young]] ascanius till his manhood owe." 
"and i, whose welfare in my [[father]] lies [[lie]]," 
ascanius adds, "by the [[great]] deities, 
by my dear [[country]], by my household gods, 
by hoary vesta's rites and dark abodes, 
adjure you both, (on you my [[fortune]] stands; 
that and my [[faith]] i plight into your hands,) 
make me but [[happy]] in his safe return, 
whose wanted presence i can only mourn; 
your [[common]] gift shall two large goblets be 
of silver, wrought with [[curious]] imagery, 
and high emboss'd, which, when old priam reign'd, 
my conqu'ring sire at sack'd arisba gain'd; 
and more, two tripods cast in antic mold, 
with two [[great]] [[talents]] of the finest gold; 
beside a costly bowl, ingrav'd with art [[arts]], 
which dido gave, when first she gave her [[heart]]. 
but, if in conquer'd [[italy]] we reign, 
when spoils by lot the victor shall obtain- 
thou saw'st the courser by proud turnus press'd: 
that, nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest, 
and shield, from [[chance]] exempt, shall be thy share: 
twelve lab'ring slaves [[slave]], twelve handmaids [[young]] and [[fair]] 
all clad in [[rich]] attire, and train'd with [[care]]; 
and, [[last]], a latian field with fruitful plains, 
and a large portion of the king's domains. 
but thou, whose years are more to mine allied- 
no [[fate]] my vow'd affection shall divide 
from thee, heroic youth! be wholly mine; 
take full possession; all my [[soul]] is thine. 
one [[faith]], one fame, one [[fate]], shall both attend; 
my life's companion, and my bosom friend: 
my [[peace]] shall be committed to thy [[care]], 
and to thy conduct my concerns in [[war]]." 
then thus the [[young]] euryalus replied: 
"whatever [[fortune]], [[good]] or [[bad]], betide, 
the same shall be my [[age]], as now my [[youth]]; 
no [[time]] shall find me wanting to my [[truth]]. 
this only from your goodness let me gain 
(and, this ungranted, all rewards [[reward]] are vain) 
of priam's [[royal]] [[race]] my [[mother]] came- 
and sure the [[best]] that ever bore the name- 
whom neither troy nor sicily could hold 
from me departing, but, o'erspent and old, 
my [[fate]] she follow'd. ignorant of this 
(whatever) danger, neither parting kiss, 
nor pious blessing taken, her i leave, 
and in this only act of all my [[life]] [[deceive]]. 
by this [[right]] hand and conscious night i swear, 
my [[soul]] so [[sad]] a farewell could not bear. 
be you her comfort; fill my vacant place 
(permit me to presume so [[great]] a grace) 
support her [[age]], forsaken and distress'd. 
that [[hope]] alone will fortify my breast 
against the worst of fortunes [[fortune]], and of fears [[fear]]." 
he said. the mov'd assistants melt in tears. 
then thus ascanius, wonderstruck to see 
that image of his filial piety: 
"so [[great]] beginnings, in so green an [[age]], 
exact the [[faith]] which i again ingage. 
thy [[mother]] all the dues shall justly claim, 
creusa had, and only want the name. 
whate'er event thy bold attempt shall have, 
't is [[merit]] to have borne a [[son]] so brave. 
now by my head, a [[sacred]] oath, i swear, 
(my [[father]] us'd it,) what, returning here 
crown'd with [[success]], i for thyself prepare, 
that, if thou fail, shall thy lov'd [[mother]] share." 
he said, and weeping, while he spoke the word, 
from his broad belt he drew a shining [[sword]], 
magnificent with gold. lycaon made, 
and in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade. 
this was his gift. [[great]] mnestheus gave his friend 
a lion's hide, his [[body]] to defend; 
and [[good]] alethes furnish'd him, beside, 
with his own trusty helm, of temper tried. 
thus arm'd they went. the [[noble]] trojans wait 
their issuing forth, and [[follow]] to the gate 
with prayers and vows. above the rest appears 
ascanius, manly far beyond his years, 
and messages committed to their [[care]], 
which all in winds were lost, and flitting air. 
the trenches first they pass'd; then took their way 
where their proud foes in pitch'd pavilions lay; 
to many fatal, ere themselves were slain. 
they found the careless host dispers'd upon the plain, 
who, gorg'd, and drunk with wine, supinely snore. 
unharness'd chariots stand along the shore: 
amidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by, 
a medley of debauch and [[war]], they [[lie]]. 
observing nisus shew'd his friend the sight: 
"behold a [[conquest]] gain'd without a [[fight]]. 
occasion offers, and i stand prepar'd; 
there lies [[lie]] our way; be thou upon the guard, 
and look around, while i securely go, 
and hew a passage thro' the sleeping foe." 
softly he spoke; then striding took his way, 
with his drawn [[sword]], where haughty rhamnes lay; 
his head rais'd high on tapestry beneath, 
and heaving from his breast, he drew his breath; 
a [[king]] and [[prophet]], by [[king]] turnus lov'd: 
but [[fate]] by prescience cannot be remov'd. 
him and his sleeping slaves [[slave]] he slew; then spies 
where remus, with his [[rich]] retinue, lies [[lie]]. 
his armor-bearer first, and next he kills 
his charioteer, intrench'd betwixt the wheels 
and his lov'd horses; [[last]] invades their [[lord]]; 
full on his neck he drives the fatal [[sword]]: 
the gasping head flies off; a purple flood 
flows from the trunk, that welters in the [[blood]], 
which, by the spurning heels dispers'd around, 
the bed besprinkles and bedews the ground. 
lamus the bold, and lamyrus the [[strong]], 
he slew, and then serranus [[fair]] and [[young]]. 
from dice and wine the [[youth]] retir'd to rest, 
and puff'd the fumy [[god]] from out his breast: 
ev'n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play- 
more lucky, had it lasted till the day. 
the famish'd lion thus, with [[hunger]] bold, 
o'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold, 
and tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe 
trembling they [[lie]], and pant beneath his paw. 
nor with less rage euryalus employs 
the wrathful [[sword]], or fewer foes destroys; 
but on th' ignoble crowd his fury flew; 
he fadus, hebesus, and rhoetus slew. 
oppress'd with heavy sleep the former fell, 
but rhoetus wakeful, and observing all: 
behind a spacious jar he slink'd for [[fear]]; 
the fatal iron found and reach'd him there; 
for, as he rose, it pierc'd his naked side, 
and, reeking, thence return'd in crimson dyed. 
the wound pours out a stream of wine and [[blood]]; 
the purple [[soul]] comes floating in the flood. 
now, where messapus quarter'd, they arrive. 
the fires [[fire]] were fainting there, and just alive; 
the warrior-horses, tied in order, fed. 
nisus observ'd the discipline, and said: 
"our eager thirst of [[blood]] may both betray; 
and see the scatter'd streaks of dawning day, 
foe to nocturnal thefts. no more, my friend; 
here let our glutted execution end. 
a lane thro' slaughter'd bodies [[body]] we have made." 
the bold euryalus, tho' loth, obey'd. 
of arms, and arras, and of plate, they find 
a precious load; but these they leave behind. 
yet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay 
to make the [[rich]] caparison his prey, 
which on the steed of conquer'd rhamnes lay. 
nor did his [[eyes]] less longingly behold 
the girdle-belt, with nails of burnish'd gold. 
this [[present]] caedicus the [[rich]] bestow'd 
on remulus, when [[friendship]] first they vow'd, 
and, absent, join'd in hospitable ties: 
he, dying, to his heir bequeath'd the prize; 
till, by the conqu'ring ardean [[troops]] oppress'd, 
he fell; and they the glorious gift possess'd. 
these glitt'ring spoils (now made the victor's gain) 
he to his [[body]] suits, but suits in [[vain]]: 
messapus' helm he finds among the rest, 
and laces on, and wears the waving crest. 
proud of their [[conquest]], prouder of their prey, 
they leave the camp, and take the ready way. 
but far they had not pass'd, before they spied 
three hundred horse, with volscens for their guide. 
the queen a legion to [[king]] turnus sent; 
but the swift horse the slower foot prevent, 
and now, advancing, sought the leader's tent. 
they saw the pair; for, thro' the doubtful shade, 
his shining helm euryalus betray'd, 
on which the moon with full reflection play'd. 
"'t is not for naught," cried volscens from the crowd, 
"these [[men]] go there;" then rais'd his voice aloud: 
"stand! stand! why thus in arms? and whither bent? 
from whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?" 
silent they scud away, and haste their flight 
to neighb'ring woods, and trust themselves to night. 
the speedy horse all passages belay, 
and spur their smoking steeds to cross their way, 
and watch each entrance of the winding wood. 
black was the forest: thick with beech it stood, 
horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn; 
few paths of [[human]] feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn.

the darkness of the shades, his heavy prey, 
and [[fear]], misled the younger from his way. 
but nisus hit the turns with happier haste, 
and, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass'd, 
and alban plains, from alba's name so call'd, 
where [[king]] latinus then his oxen stall'd; 
till, turning at the length, he stood his ground, 
and miss'd his friend, and cast his [[eyes]] around: 
"ah wretch!" he cried, "where have i left behind 
th' unhappy [[youth]]? where shall i [[hope]] to find? 
or what way take?" again he ventures back, 
and treads the mazes of his former track. 
he winds the wood, and, list'ning, hears the noise 
of tramping coursers, and the riders' voice. 
the sound approach'd; and suddenly he view'd 
the foes inclosing, and his friend pursued, 
forelaid and taken, while he strove in [[vain]] 
the shelter of the friendly shades to gain. 
what should he next attempt? what arms employ, 
what fruitless [[force]], to [[free]] the captive boy? 
or desperate should he rush and lose his [[life]], 
with odds oppress'd, in such unequal strife? 
resolv'd at length, his pointed spear he shook; 
and, casting on the moon a mournful look: 
"guardian of groves, and [[goddess]] of the night, 
fair queen," he said, "direct my dart aright. 
if e'er my pious [[father]], for my sake, 
did grateful off'rings on thy altars make, 
or i increas'd them with my sylvan toils, 
and hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils, 
give me to scatter these." then from his ear 
he pois'd, and aim'd, and launch'd the trembling spear. 
the deadly weapon, hissing from the grove, 
impetuous on the back of sulmo drove; 
pierc'd his thin armor, drank his vital [[blood]], 
and in his [[body]] left the broken 
he staggers round; his eyeballs roll in [[death]], 
and with short sobs he gasps away his breath. 
all stand amaz'd- a second jav'lin flies 
with [[equal]] [[strength]], and quivers thro' the skies [[sky]]. 
this thro' thy temples, tagus, forc'd the way, 
and in the brainpan warmly buried lay. 
fierce volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round, 
descried not him who gave the fatal wound, 
nor knew to fix [[revenge]]: "but thou," he cries, 
"shalt [[pay]] for both," and at the pris'ner flies 
with his drawn [[sword]]. then, struck with deep despair, 
that cruel sight the lover could not bear; 
but from his covert rush'd in open view, 
and sent his voice before him as he flew: 
"me! me!" he cried- "turn all your swords [[sword]] alone 
on me- the [[fact]] confess'd, the [[fault]] my own. 
he neither could nor durst, the guiltless [[youth]]: 
ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth! 
his only crime (if [[friendship]] can offend) 
is too much [[love]] to his unhappy friend." 
too late he speaks: the [[sword]], which fury guides, 
driv'n with full [[force]], had pierc'd his tender sides. 
down fell the beauteous [[youth]]: the yawning wound 
gush'd out a purple stream, and stain'd the ground. 
his snowy neck reclines upon his breast, 
like a [[fair]] flow'r by the keen share oppress'd; 
like a [[white]] poppy sinking on the plain, 
whose heavy head is overcharg'd with rain. 
despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow'd, 
drove nisus headlong on the hostile crowd. 
volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends: 
borne back and bor'd by his surrounding [[friends]], 
onward he press'd, and kept him still in sight; 
then whirl'd aloft his [[sword]] with all his might: 
th' unerring steel descended while he spoke, 
piered his wide mouth, and thro' his weazon broke. 
dying, he slew; and, stagg'ring on the plain, 
with swimming [[eyes]] he sought his lover slain; 
then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell, 
content, in [[death]], to be reveng'd so well. 
o [[happy]] friends! for, if my verse can give 
immortal [[life]], your fame shall ever [[live]], 
fix'd as the capitol's foundation lies [[lie]], 
and spread, where'er the roman eagle flies! 
the conqu'ring party first divide the prey, 
then their slain leader to the camp convey. 
with wonder, as they went, the [[troops]] were fill'd, 
to see such numbers whom so few had kill'd. 
serranus, rhamnes, and the rest, they found: 
vast crowds the dying and the [[dead]] surround; 
and the yet reeking [[blood]] o'erflows the ground. 
all knew the helmet which messapus lost, 
but mourn'd a purchase that so dear had cost. 
now rose the ruddy morn from tithon's bed, 
and with the dawn of day the skies [[sky]] o'erspread; 
nor long the sun his daily course withheld, 
but added colors to the [[world]] reveal'd: 
when early turnus, wak'ning with the [[light]], 
all clad in armor, calls his [[troops]] to [[fight]]. 
his martial [[men]] with fierce harangue he fir'd, 
and his own ardor in their souls [[soul]] inspir'd. 
this done- to give new terror to his foes, 
the heads of nisus and his friend he shows, 
rais'd high on pointed spears- a ghastly sight: 
loud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous delight. 
meantime the trojans run, where danger calls; 
they line their trenches, and they [[man]] their walls. 
in front extended to the left they stood; 
safe was the [[right]], surrounded by the flood. 
but, casting from their tow'rs a frightful view, 
they saw the faces, which too well they knew, 
tho' then disguis'd in [[death]], and smear'd all o'er 
with filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore. 
soon hasty fame thro' the [[sad]] [[city]] bears 
the mournful message to the mother's ears. 
an icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes; 
her cheeks the [[blood]], her hand the web forsakes. 
she runs the rampires round amidst the [[war]], 
nor fears [[fear]] the flying darts; she rends her hair, 
and fills with loud laments the liquid air. 
"thus, then, my lov'd euryalus appears! 
thus looks the prop my declining years! 
was't on this face my famish'd [[eyes]] i fed? 
ah! how unlike the living is the dead! 
and could'st thou leave me, cruel, thus alone? 
not one [[kind]] kiss from a departing son! 
no look, no [[last]] adieu before he went, 
in an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent! 
cold on the ground, and pressing [[foreign]] clay, 
to latian dogs and fowls he lies [[lie]] a prey! 
nor was i near to close his dying [[eyes]], 
to wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies, 
to call about his corpse his crying [[friends]], 
or spread the mantle (made for other ends) 
on his dear [[body]], which i wove with [[care]], 
nor did my daily pains [[pain]] or nightly labor spare. 
where shall i find his corpse? what [[earth]] sustains 
his trunk dismember'd, and his cold remains? 
for this, alas! i left my needful ease, 
expos'd my [[life]] to winds and winter seas! 
if any [[pity]] touch rutulian hearts [[heart]], 
here empty all your quivers, all your darts; 
or, if they fail, thou, jove, conclude my woe, 
and send me thunderstruck to shades below!" 
her shrieks and clamors pierce the trojans' ears, 
unman their [[courage]], and augment their fears [[fear]]; 
nor [[young]] ascanius could the sight sustain, 
nor old ilioneus his tears restrain, 
but actor and idaeus jointly sent, 
to bear the madding [[mother]] to her tent. 
and now the trumpets terribly, from far, 
with rattling clangor, rouse the sleepy [[war]]. 
the soldiers' shouts succeed the brazen sounds; 
and heav'n, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds. 
the volscians bear their shields upon their head, 
and, rushing forward, form a moving shed. 
these fill the ditch; those pull the bulwarks down: 
some raise the ladders; others scale the town. 
but, where void spaces on the walls appear, 
or thin defense, they pour their forces [[force]] there. 
with poles and missive [[weapons]], from afar, 
the trojans keep aloof the rising [[war]]. 
taught, by their ten years' siege, defensive [[fight]], 
they roll down ribs of rocks, an unresisted weight, 
to break the penthouse with the pond'rous blow, 
which yet the patient volscians undergo: 
but could not bear th' unequal combat long; 
for, where the trojans find the thickest throng, 
the ruin falls: their shatter'd shields give way, 
and their crush'd heads become an easy prey. 
they shrink for [[fear]], abated of their rage, 
nor longer dare in a blind [[fight]] engage; 
contented now to gall them from below 
with darts and slings, and with the distant bow. 
elsewhere mezentius, terrible to view, 
a blazing pine within the trenches threw. 
but brave messapus, neptune's warlike [[son]], 
broke down the palisades, the trenches won, 
and loud for ladders calls, to scale the town. 
calliope, begin! ye [[sacred]] nine, 
inspire your poet in his high design, 
to sing what slaughter manly turnus made, 
what souls [[soul]] he sent below the stygian shade, 
what fame the soldiers with their captain share, 
and the vast circuit of the fatal [[war]]; 
for you in singing martial facts [[fact]] excel; 
you [[best]] [[remember]], and alone can tell. 
there stood a tow'r, amazing to the sight, 
built up of beams, and of stupendous height: 
art, and the [[nature]] of the place, conspir'd 
to furnish all the [[strength]] that [[war]] requir'd. 
to level this, the bold italians join; 
the wary trojans obviate their design; 
with weighty stones o'erwhelm their [[troops]] below, 
shoot thro' the loopholes, and sharp jav'lins throw. 
turnus, the [[chief]], toss'd from his thund'ring hand 
against the wooden walls, a flaming brand: 
it stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high; 
the planks were season'd, and the timber dry. 
contagion caught the posts; it spread along, 
scorch'd, and to distance drove the scatter'd throng. 
the trojans fled; the [[fire]] pursued amain, 
still gath'ring fast upon the trembling train; 
till, crowding to the corners of the wall, 
down the defense and the defenders fall. 
the mighty flaw makes heav'n itself resound: 
the [[dead]] and dying trojans strew the ground. 
the tow'r, that follow'd on the fallen crew, 
whelm'd o'er their heads, and buried whom it slew: 
some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent; 
all the same [[equal]] ruin underwent. 
young lycus and helenor only scape; 
sav'd- how, they [[know]] not- from the steepy leap. 
helenor, elder of the two: by birth, 
on one side [[royal]], one a [[son]] of [[earth]], 
whom to the lydian [[king]] licymnia bare, 
and sent her boasted bastard to the [[war]] 
(a [[privilege]] which none but freemen share). 
slight were his arms, a [[sword]] and silver shield: 
no marks of [[honor]] charg'd its empty field. 
light as he fell, so [[light]] the [[youth]] arose, 
and rising, found himself amidst his foes; 
nor flight was left, nor hopes [[hope]] to [[force]] his way. 
embolden'd by despair, he stood at bay; 
and- like a stag, whom all the troop surrounds 
of eager huntsmen and invading hounds- 
resolv'd on [[death]], he dissipates his fears [[fear]], 
and bounds aloft against the pointed spears: 
so dares the [[youth]], secure of [[death]]; and throws 
his dying [[body]] on his thickest foes. 
but lycus, swifter of his feet by far, 
runs, doubles, winds and turns, amidst the [[war]]; 
springs to the walls, and leaves his foes behind, 
and snatches at the beam he first can find; 
looks up, and leaps aloft at all the stretch, 
in hopes [[hope]] the helping hand of some [[kind]] friend to reach. 
but turnus follow'd hard his hunted prey 
(his spear had almost reach'd him in the way, 
short of his reins, and scarce a span behind) 
"fool!" said the [[chief]], "tho' fleeter than the wind, 
couldst thou presume to scape, when i pursue?" 
he said, and downward by the feet he drew 
the trembling dastard; at the tug he falls; 
vast ruins come along, rent from the smoking walls. 
thus on some silver swan, or tim'rous hare, 
jove's bird comes sousing down from upper air; 
her crooked talons truss the fearful prey: 
then out of sight she soars, and wings her way. 
so seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb, 
in [[vain]] lamented by the bleating dam. 
then rushing onward with a barb'rous cry, 
the [[troops]] of turnus to the combat fly. 
the ditch with fagots fill'd, the daring foe 
toss'd firebrands to the steepy turrets throw. 
ilioneus, as bold lucetius came 
to [[force]] the gate, and feed the kindling flame, 
roll'd down the fragment of a rock so [[right]], 
it crush'd him double underneath the weight. 
two more [[young]] liger and asylas slew: 
to bend the bow [[young]] liger [[better]] knew; 
asylas [[best]] the pointed jav'lin threw. 
brave caeneus laid ortygius on the plain; 
the victor caeneus was by turnus slain. 
by the same hand, clonius and itys fall, 
sagar, and ida, standing on the wall. 
from capys' arms his [[fate]] privernus found: 
hurt by themilla first-but slight the wound- 
his shield thrown by, to mitigate the smart, 
he clapp'd his hand upon the wounded part: 
the second shaft came swift and unespied, 
and pierc'd his hand, and nail'd it to his side, 
transfix'd his breathing lungs and beating [[heart]]: 
the [[soul]] came issuing out, and hiss'd against the dart. 
the [[son]] of arcens shone amid the rest, 
in glitt'ring armor and a purple vest, 
(fair was his face, his [[eyes]] inspiring [[love]],) 
bred by his [[father]] in the martian grove, 
where the fat altars of palicus flame, 
and send in arms to purchase early fame. 
him when he spied from far, the tuscan [[king]] 
laid by the lance, and took him to the sling, 
thrice whirl'd the thong around his head, and threw: 
the heated lead half melted as it flew; 
it pierc'd his hollow temples and his brain; 
the [[youth]] came tumbling down, and spurn'd the plain. 
then [[young]] ascanius, who, before this day, 
was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey, 
first bent in martial strife the twanging bow, 
and exercis'd against a [[human]] foe- 
with this bereft numanus of his [[life]], 
who turnus' younger sister took to [[wife]]. 
proud of his realm, and of his [[royal]] bride, 
vaunting before his [[troops]], and lengthen'd with a stride,

in these insulting terms the trojans he defied: 
"twice-conquer'd cowards, now your shame is shown- 
coop'd up a second [[time]] within your town! 
who dare not issue forth in open field, 
but hold your walls before you for a shield. 
thus threat you [[war]]? thus our [[alliance]] [[force]]? 
what gods, what madness, hether steer'd your course? 
you shall not find the sons [[son]] of atreus here, 
nor need the frauds of sly [[ulysses]] [[fear]]. 
strong from the cradle, of a sturdy brood, 
we bear our newborn infants to the flood; 
there bath'd amid the stream, our boys we hold, 
with winter harden'd, and inur'd to cold. 
they wake before the day to range the wood, 
kill ere they [[eat]], nor taste unconquer'd food. 
no sports [[sport]], but what belong to [[war]], they [[know]]: 
to break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow. 
our [[youth]], of labor patient, earn their bread; 
hardly they [[work]], with frugal diet fed. 
from plows and harrows sent to seek renown, 
they [[fight]] in fields, and storm the shaken town. 
no part of [[life]] from toils of [[war]] is [[free]], 
no [[change]] in [[age]], or diff'rence in [[degree]]. 
we plow and till in arms; our oxen [[feel]], 
instead of goads, the spur and pointed steel; 
th' inverted lance makes furrows in the plain. 
ev'n [[time]], that changes [[change]] all, yet changes [[change]] us in [[vain]]: 
the [[body]], not the [[mind]]; nor can control 
th' [[immortal]] vigor, or abate the [[soul]]. 
our helms defend the [[young]], [[disguise]] the gray: 
we [[live]] by plunder, and delight in prey. 
your vests embroider'd with [[rich]] purple shine; 
in sloth you [[glory]], and in dances join. 
your vests have sweeping sleeves; with female [[pride]] 
your turbants underneath your chins are tied. 
go, phrygians, to your dindymus again! 
go, less than [[women]], in the shapes of men! 
go, mix'd with eunuchs, in the mother's rites, 
where with unequal sound the flute invites; 
sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in ida's shade: 
resign the [[war]] to [[men]], who [[know]] the martial trade!" 
this foul reproach ascanius could not hear 
with patience, or a vow'd [[revenge]] forbear. 
at the full stretch of both his hands he drew, 
and almost join'd the horns of the tough yew. 
but, first, before the [[throne]] of jove he stood, 
and thus with lifted hands invok'd the [[god]]: 
"my first attempt, [[great]] [[jupiter]], succeed! 
an annual off'ring in thy grove shall bleed; 
a snow-white steer, before thy altar [[led]], 
who, like his [[mother]], bears aloft his head, 
butts with his threat'ning brows, and bellowing stands, 
and dares the [[fight]], and spurns the yellow sands." 
jove bow'd the heav'ns, and lent a gracious ear, 
and thunder'd on the left, amidst the clear. 
sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies 
the feather'd [[death]], and hisses thro' the skies [[sky]]. 
the steel thro' both his temples forc'd the way: 
extended on the ground, numanus lay. 
"go now, [[vain]] boaster, and true valor scorn! 
the phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return."

ascanius said no more. the trojans shake 
the heav'ns with shouting, and new vigor take. 
apollo then bestrode a golden cloud, 
to view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd; 
and thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud: 
"advance, illustrious [[youth]], increase in fame, 
and wide from east to west extend thy name; 
offspring of gods thyself; and [[rome]] shall owe 
to thee a [[race]] of demigods below. 
this is the way to heav'n: the pow'rs [[divine]] 
from this beginning date the julian line. 
to thee, to them, and their victorious heirs, 
the conquer'd [[war]] is due, and the vast [[world]] is theirs. 
troy is too narrow for thy name." he said, 
and plunging downward shot his radiant head; 
dispell'd the breathing air, that broke his flight: 
shorn of his beams, a [[man]] to mortal sight. 
old butes' form he took, anchises' squire, 
now left, to [[rule]] ascanius, by his sire: 
his wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs, 
his mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears, 
and thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years: 
"suffice it thee, thy father's worthy [[son]], 
the warlike prize thou hast already won. 
the [[god]] of archers gives thy [[youth]] a part 
of his own [[praise]], nor envies [[equal]] art [[arts]]. 
now tempt the [[war]] no more." he said, and flew 
obscure in air, and vanish'd from their view. 
the trojans, by his arms, their patron [[know]], 
and hear the twanging of his heav'nly bow. 
then duteous [[force]] they use, and phoebus' name, 
to keep from [[fight]] the [[youth]] too fond of fame. 
undaunted, they themselves no danger shun; 
from wall to wall the shouts and clamors run. 
they bend their bows; they whirl their slings around; 
heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground; 
and helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound. 
the combat thickens, like the storm that flies 
from westward, when the show'ry kids arise; 
or patt'ring hail comes pouring on the main, 
when [[jupiter]] descends in harden'd rain, 
or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound, 
and with an armed winter strew the ground. 
pand'rus and bitias, thunderbolts of [[war]], 
whom hiera to bold alcanor bare 
on ida's top, two youths [[youth]] of height and size 
like firs that on their [[mother]] mountain rise, 
presuming on their [[force]], the gates unbar, 
and of their own accord invite the [[war]]. 
with fates [[fate]] averse, against their king's command, 
arm'd, on the [[right]] and on the left they stand, 
and flank the passage: shining steel they wear, 
and waving crests above their heads appear. 
thus two tall oaks, that padus' banks adorn, 
lift up to heav'n their leafy heads unshorn, 
and, overpress'd with nature's heavy load, 
dance to the whistling winds, and at each other nod. 
in flows a tide of latians, when they see 
the gate set open, and the passage [[free]]; 
bold quercens, with rash tmarus, rushing on, 
equicolus, that in bright armor shone, 
and haemon first; but soon repuls'd they fly, 
or in the well-defended pass they [[die]]. 
these with [[success]] are fir'd, and those with rage, 
and each on [[equal]] terms at length ingage. 
drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain, 
the trojans hand to hand the [[fight]] maintain. 
fierce turnus in another quarter fought, 
when suddenly th' unhop'd-for news was brought, 
the foes had left the fastness of their place, 
prevail'd in [[fight]], and had his [[men]] in chase. 
he quits th' attack, and, to prevent their [[fate]], 
runs where the giant brothers [[brother]] guard the gate. 
the first he met, antiphates the brave, 
but base-begotten on a theban [[slave]], 
sarpedon's [[son]], he slew: the deadly dart 
found passage thro' his breast, and pierc'd his [[heart]]. 
fix'd in the wound th' italian cornel stood, 
warm'd in his lungs, and in his vital [[blood]]. 
aphidnus next, and erymanthus dies, 
and meropes, and the gigantic size 
of bitias, threat'ning with his ardent [[eyes]]. 
not by the feeble dart he fell oppress'd 
(a dart were lost within that roomy breast), 
but from a knotted lance, large, heavy, [[strong]], 
which roar'd like thunder as it whirl'd along: 
not two bull hides th' impetuous [[force]] withhold, 
nor coat of double mail, with scales of gold. 
down sunk the monster bulk and press'd the ground; 
his arms and clatt'ring shield on the vast [[body]] sound, 
not with less ruin than the bajan mole, 
rais'd on the seas, the surges to control- 
at once comes tumbling down the rocky wall; 
prone to the deep, the stones disjointed fall 
of the vast pile; the scatter'd ocean flies; 
black sands, discolor'd froth, and mingled mud arise: 
the frighted billows roll, and seek the shores; 
then trembles prochyta, then ischia roars: 
typhoeus, thrown beneath, by jove's command, 
astonish'd at the flaw that shakes the [[land]], 
soon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake, 
with wonder feels [[feel]] the weight press lighter on his back. 
the warrior [[god]] the latian [[troops]] inspir'd, 
new strung their sinews, and their [[courage]] fir'd, 
but chills the trojan hearts [[heart]] with cold affright: 
then black despair precipitates their flight. 
when pandarus beheld his [[brother]] kill'd, 
the town with [[fear]] and wild confusion fill'd, 
he turns the hinges of the heavy gate 
with both his hands, and adds his shoulders to the weight

some happier [[friends]] within the walls inclos'd; 
the rest shut out, to [[certain]] [[death]] expos'd: 
fool as he was, and frantic in his [[care]], 
t' admit [[young]] turnus, and include the war! 
he thrust amid the crowd, securely bold, 
like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold. 
too late his blazing buckler they descry, 
and sparkling fires [[fire]] that shot from either eye, 
his mighty members, and his ample breast, 
his rattling armor, and his crimson crest. 
far from that hated face the trojans fly, 
all but the [[fool]] who sought his [[destiny]]. 
mad pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow'd 
for bitias' [[death]], and threatens thus aloud: 
"these are not ardea's walls, nor this the town 
amata proffers with lavinia's [[crown]]: 
't is hostile [[earth]] you tread. of [[hope]] bereft, 
no means of safe return by flight are left." 
to whom, with count'nance calm, and [[soul]] sedate, 
thus turnus: "then begin, and try thy [[fate]]: 
my message to the ghost of priam bear; 
tell him a new achilles sent thee there." 
a lance of tough ground ash the trojan threw, 
rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew: 
with his full [[force]] he whirl'd it first around; 
but the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound: 
imperial juno turn'd the course before, 
and fix'd the wand'ring weapon in the door. 
"but [[hope]] not thou," said turnus, "when i strike, 
to shun thy [[fate]]: our [[force]] is not alike, 
nor thy steel temper'd by the lemnian [[god]]." 
then rising, on his utmost stretch he stood, 
and aim'd from high: the full descending blow 
cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two. 
down sinks the giant with a thund'ring sound: 
his pond'rous limbs [[oppress]] the trembling ground; 
blood, brains, and foam gush from the gaping wound: 
scalp, face, and shoulders the keen steel divides, 
and the shar'd visage hangs on [[equal]] sides. 
the trojans fly from their approaching [[fate]]; 
and, had the victor then secur'd the gate, 
and to his [[troops]] without unclos'd the bars, 
one lucky day had ended all his wars [[war]]. 
but boiling [[youth]], and blind [[desire]] of [[blood]], 
push'd on his fury, to pursue the crowd. 
hamstring'd behind, unhappy gyges died; 
then phalaris is added to his side. 
the pointed jav'lins from the [[dead]] he drew, 
and their friends' arms against their fellows threw. 
strong halys stands in [[vain]]; [[weak]] phlegys flies; 
saturnia, still at hand, new [[force]] and [[fire]] supplies. 
then halius, prytanis, alcander fall- 
ingag'd against the foes who scal'd the wall: 
but, whom they fear'd without, they found within. 
at [[last]], tho' late, by lynceus he was seen. 
he calls new succors, and assaults the [[prince]]: 
but [[weak]] his [[force]], and [[vain]] is their defense. 
turn'd to the [[right]], his [[sword]] the hero drew, 
and at one blow the bold aggressor slew. 
he joints the neck; and, with a stroke so [[strong]], 
the helm flies off, and bears the head along. 
next him, the huntsman amycus he kill'd, 
in darts invenom'd and in poison skill'd. 
then clytius fell beneath his fatal spear, 
and creteus, whom the muses held so dear: 
he fought with [[courage]], and he sung the [[fight]]; 
arms were his bus'ness, verses his delight. 
the trojan chiefs [[chief]] behold, with rage and [[grief]], 
their slaughter'd [[friends]], and hasten their relief. 
bold mnestheus rallies first the broken train, 
whom brave seresthus and his troop sustain. 
to save the living, and [[revenge]] the [[dead]], 
against one warrior's arms all troy they [[led]]. 
"o, void of sense and courage!" mnestheus cried, 
"where can you [[hope]] your [[coward]] heads to hide? 
ah! where beyond these rampires can you run? 
one [[man]], and in your camp inclos'd, you shun! 
shall then a [[single]] [[sword]] such slaughter boast, 
and pass unpunish'd from a num'rous host? 
forsaking [[honor]], and renouncing fame, 
your gods, your [[country]], and your [[king]] you shame!" 
this just reproach their [[virtue]] does excite: 
they stand, they join, they thicken to the [[fight]]. 
now turnus doubts [[doubt]], and yet disdains to yield, 
but with slow paces measures back the field, 
and inches to the walls, where tiber's tide, 
washing the camp, defends the weaker side. 
the more he loses, they advance the more, 
and tread in ev'ry step he trod before. 
they shout: they bear him back; and, whom by might 
they cannot conquer, they [[oppress]] with weight. 
as, compass'd with a wood of spears around, 
the lordly lion still maintains his ground; 
grins horrible, retires, and turns again; 
threats his distended paws, and shakes his mane; 
he loses while in [[vain]] he presses on, 
nor will his [[courage]] let him dare to run: 
so turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight, 
moves tardy back, and just recedes from [[fight]]. 
yet twice, inrag'd, the combat he renews, 
twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues. 
but now they swarm, and, with fresh [[troops]] supplied, 
come rolling on, and rush from ev'ry side: 
nor juno, who sustain'd his arms before, 
dares with new [[strength]] suffice th' exhausted store; 
for jove, with sour commands, sent iris down, 
to [[force]] th' invader from the frighted town. 
with labor spent, no longer can he wield 
the heavy fanchion, or sustain the shield, 
o'erwhelm'd with darts, which from afar they fling: 
the [[weapons]] round his hollow temples ring; 
his golden helm gives way, with stony blows 
batter'd, and flat, and beaten to his brows. 
his crest is rash'd away; his ample shield 
is falsified, and round with jav'lins fill'd. 
the foe, now faint, the trojans overwhelm; 
and mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm. 
sick sweat succeeds; he drops at ev'ry pore; 
with driving dust his cheeks are pasted o'er; 
shorter and shorter ev'ry gasp he takes; 
and [[vain]] efforts and hurtless blows he makes. 
plung'd in the flood, and made the waters fly. 
the yellow [[god]] the welcome burthen bore, 
and wip'd the sweat, and wash'd away the gore; 
then gently wafts him to the farther coast, 
and sends him safe to cheer his anxious host.

book x

the gates of heav'n unfold: jove summons all 
the gods to council in the [[common]] hall. 
sublimely seated, he surveys from far 
the fields, the camp, the [[fortune]] of the [[war]], 
and all th' inferior [[world]]. from first to [[last]], 
the sov'reign senate in degrees [[degree]] are plac'd. 
then thus th' almighty sire began: "ye gods, 
natives or denizens of blest abodes, 
from whence these murmurs, and this [[change]] of [[mind]], 
this backward [[fate]] from what was first design'd? 
why this protracted [[war]], when my commands 
pronounc'd a [[peace]], and gave the latian lands [[land]]? 
what [[fear]] or [[hope]] on either part divides 
our heav'ns, and arms our powers [[power]] on diff'rent sides? 
a lawful [[time]] of [[war]] at length will come, 
(nor need your haste anticipate the doom), 
when [[carthage]] shall contend the [[world]] with [[rome]], 
shall [[force]] the rigid rocks and alpine chains, 
and, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. 
then is your [[time]] for faction and debate, 
for partial favor, and permitted hate. 
let now your immature dissension cease; 
sit quiet, and compose your souls [[soul]] to [[peace]]." 
thus [[jupiter]] in few unfolds the charge; 
but lovely [[venus]] thus replies at large: 
"o pow'r immense, eternal energy, 
(for to what else protection can we fly?) 
seest thou the proud rutulians, how they dare 
in fields, unpunish'd, and insult my [[care]]? 
how lofty turnus vaunts amidst his train, 
in shining arms, triumphant on the plain? 
ev'n in their lines and trenches they contend, 
and scarce their walls the trojan [[troops]] defend: 
the town is fill'd with slaughter, and o'erfloats, 
with a red deluge, their increasing moats. 
aeneas, ignorant, and far from thence, 
has left a camp expos'd, without defense. 
this endless outrage shall they still sustain? 
shall troy renew'd be forc'd and fir'd again? 
a second siege my banish'd issue fears [[fear]], 
and a new diomede in arms appears. 
one more audacious mortal will be found; 
and i, thy [[daughter]], wait another wound. 
yet, if with fates [[fate]] averse, without thy leave, 
the latian lands [[land]] my progeny receive, 
bear they the pains [[pain]] of violated [[law]], 
and thy protection from their aid withdraw. 
but, if the gods their sure [[success]] foretell; 
if those of heav'n [[consent]] with those of hell, 
to promise [[italy]]; who dare debate 
the pow'r of jove, or fix another [[fate]]? 
what should i tell of tempests on the main, 
of aeolus usurping neptune's reign? 
of iris sent, with bacchanalian heat 
t' inspire the matrons, and [[destroy]] the fleet? 
now juno to the stygian [[sky]] descends, 
solicits hell for aid, and arms the fiends. 
that new [[example]] wanted yet above: 
an act that well became the [[wife]] of jove! 
alecto, rais'd by her, with rage inflames 
the peaceful bosoms of the latian dames. 
imperial sway no more exalts my [[mind]]; 
(such hopes [[hope]] i had indeed, while heav'n was [[kind]];) 
now let my happier foes possess my place, 
whom jove prefers before the trojan [[race]]; 
and conquer they, whom you with [[conquest]] grace. 
since you can spare, from all your wide command, 
no spot of [[earth]], no hospitable [[land]], 
which may my wand'ring fugitives receive; 
(since haughty juno will not give you leave;) 
then, [[father]], (if i still may use that name,) 
by ruin'd troy, yet smoking from the flame, 
i beg you, let ascanius, by my [[care]], 
be freed from danger, and dismiss'd the [[war]]: 
inglorious let him [[live]], without a [[crown]]. 
the [[father]] may be cast on coasts unknown, 
struggling with [[fate]]; but let me save the [[son]]. 
mine is cythera, mine the cyprian tow'rs: 
in those recesses, and those [[sacred]] bow'rs, 
obscurely let him rest; his [[right]] resign 
to promis'd [[empire]], and his julian line. 
then [[carthage]] may th' ausonian towns [[destroy]], 
nor [[fear]] the [[race]] of a rejected boy. 
what profits [[profit]] it my [[son]] to scape the [[fire]], 
arm'd with his gods, and loaded with his sire; 
to pass the perils of the seas and wind; 
evade the greeks [[greek]], and leave the [[war]] behind; 
to reach th' italian shores; if, after all, 
our second pergamus is doom'd to fall? 
much [[better]] had he curb'd his high desires [[desire]], 
and hover'd o'er his ill-extinguish'd fires [[fire]]. 
to simois' banks the fugitives restore, 
and give them back to [[war]], and all the woes before." 
deep indignation swell'd saturnia's [[heart]]: 
"and must i own," she said, "my secret smart- 
what with more decence were in [[silence]] kept, 
and, but for this [[unjust]] reproach, had slept? 
did [[god]] or [[man]] your fav'rite [[son]] advise, 
with [[war]] unhop'd the latians to surprise? 
by [[fate]], you boast, and by the gods' decree, 
he left his native [[land]] for italy! 
confess the [[truth]]; by mad cassandra, more 
than heav'n inspir'd, he sought a [[foreign]] shore! 
did i persuade to trust his second troy 
to the raw conduct of a beardless boy, 
with walls unfinish'd, which himself forsakes, 
and thro' the waves a wand'ring [[voyage]] takes? 
when have i urg'd him meanly to demand 
the tuscan aid, and arm a quiet [[land]]? 
did i or iris give this mad [[advice]], 
or made the [[fool]] himself the fatal [[choice]]? 
you [[think]] it hard, the latians should [[destroy]] 
with swords [[sword]] your trojans, and with fires [[fire]] your troy! 
hard and [[unjust]] indeed, for [[men]] to draw 
their native air, nor take a [[foreign]] law! 
that turnus is permitted still to [[live]], 
to whom his birth a [[god]] and [[goddess]] give! 
but yet is just and lawful for your line 
to drive their fields, and [[force]] with fraud to join; 
realms, not your own, among your clans divide, 
and from the bridegroom tear the promis'd bride; 
petition, while you [[public]] arms prepare; 
pretend a [[peace]], and yet provoke a war! 
't was giv'n to you, your darling [[son]] to shroud, 
to draw the dastard from the fighting crowd, 
and, for a [[man]], obtend an empty cloud. 
from flaming fleets you turn'd the [[fire]] away, 
and chang'd the ships to daughters [[daughter]] of the sea. 
but is my crime- the queen of heav'n offends, 
if she presume to save her suff'ring friends! 
your [[son]], not knowing what his foes decree, 
you say, is absent: absent let him be. 
yours is cythera, yours the cyprian tow'rs, 
the soft recesses, and the [[sacred]] bow'rs. 
why do you then these needless arms prepare, 
and thus provoke a [[people]] prone to [[war]]? 
did i with [[fire]] the trojan town deface, 
or hinder from return your exil'd [[race]]? 
was i the cause of mischief, or the [[man]] 
whose lawless [[lust]] the fatal [[war]] began? 
think on whose [[faith]] th' adult'rous [[youth]] relied; 
who promis'd, who procur'd, the spartan bride? 
when all th' [[united]] states of greece combin'd, 
to purge the [[world]] of the perfidious [[kind]], 
then was your [[time]] to [[fear]] the trojan [[fate]]: 
your quarrels and complaints are now too late." 
thus juno. murmurs rise, with mix'd applause, 
just as they favor or dislike the cause. 
so winds, when yet unfledg'd in woods they [[lie]], 
in whispers first their tender voices try, 
then issue on the main with bellowing rage, 
and storms to trembling mariners presage. 
then thus to both replied th' imperial [[god]], 
who shakes heav'n's axles with his awful nod. 
(when he begins, the silent senate stand 
with rev'rence, list'ning to the dread command: 
the clouds dispel; the winds their breath restrain; 
and the hush'd waves [[lie]] flatted on the main.) 
"celestials, your attentive ears incline! 
since," said the [[god]], "the trojans must not join 
in wish'd [[alliance]] with the latian line; 
since endless jarrings and [[immortal]] hate 
tend but to discompose our [[happy]] [[state]]; 
the [[war]] henceforward be resign'd to [[fate]]: 
each to his proper [[fortune]] stand or fall; 
equal and unconcern'd i look on all. 
rutulians, trojans, are the same to me; 
and both shall draw the lots their fates [[fate]] decree. 
let these assault, if [[fortune]] be their friend; 
and, if she favors those, let those defend: 
the fates [[fate]] will find their way." the thund'rer said, 
and shook the [[sacred]] honors of his head, 
attesting styx, th' inviolable flood, 
and the black regions of his [[brother]] [[god]]. 
trembled the poles of heav'n, and [[earth]] confess'd the nod.

this end the sessions had: the senate rise, 
and to his palace wait their sov'reign thro' the skies [[sky]]. 
meantime, intent upon their siege, the foes 
within their walls the trojan host inclose: 
they wound, they kill, they watch at ev'ry gate; 
renew the fires [[fire]], and urge their [[happy]] [[fate]]. 
th' aeneans [[wish]] in [[vain]] their wanted [[chief]], 
hopeless of flight, more hopeless of relief. 
thin on the tow'rs they stand; and ev'n those few 
a feeble, fainting, and dejected crew. 
yet in the face of danger some there stood: 
the two bold brothers [[brother]] of sarpedon's [[blood]], 
asius and acmon; both th' assaraci; 
young haemon, and tho' [[young]], resolv'd to [[die]]. 
with these were clarus and thymoetes join'd; 
tibris and castor, both of lycian [[kind]]. 
from acmon's hands a rolling stone there came, 
so large, it half deserv'd a mountain's name: 
strong-sinew'd was the [[youth]], and big of bone; 
his [[brother]] mnestheus could not more have done, 
or the [[great]] [[father]] of th' intrepid [[son]]. 
some firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send; 
and some with darts, and some with stones defend. 
amid the press appears the beauteous boy, 
the [[care]] of [[venus]], and the [[hope]] of troy. 
his lovely face unarm'd, his head was bare; 
in ringlets o'er his shoulders hung his hair. 
his forehead circled with a diadem; 
distinguish'd from the crowd, he shines a gem, 
enchas'd in gold, or polish'd iv'ry set, 
amidst the meaner foil of sable jet. 
nor ismarus was wanting to the [[war]], 
directing pointed arrows from afar, 
and [[death]] with poison arm'd- in lydia born, 
where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn; 
where proud pactolus floats the fruitful lands [[land]], 
and leaves a [[rich]] manure of golden sands. 
there capys, author of the capuan name, 
and there was mnestheus too, increas'd in fame, 
since turnus from the camp he cast with shame. 
thus mortal [[war]] was wag'd on either side. 
meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide: 
for, anxious, from evander when he went, 
he sought the tyrrhene camp, and tarchon's tent; 
expos'd the cause of coming to the [[chief]]; 
his name and [[country]] told, and ask'd relief; 
propos'd the terms; his own small [[strength]] declar'd; 
what vengeance proud mezentius had prepar'd: 
what turnus, bold and [[violent]], design'd; 
then shew'd the slipp'ry [[state]] of humankind, 
and fickle [[fortune]]; warn'd him to beware, 
and to his wholesome counsel added pray'r. 
tarchon, without delay, the treaty signs, 
and to the trojan [[troops]] the tuscan joins. 
they soon set sail; nor now the fates [[fate]] withstand; 
their forces [[force]] trusted with a [[foreign]] hand. 
aeneas leads; upon his stern appear 
two lions carv'd, which rising ida bear- 
ida, to wand'ring trojans ever dear. 
under their grateful shade [[aeneas]] sate, 
revolving war's events, and various [[fate]]. 
his left [[young]] pallas kept, fix'd to his side, 
and oft of winds enquir'd, and of the tide; 
oft of the stars, and of their wat'ry way; 
and what he suffer'd both by [[land]] and sea. 
now, [[sacred]] sisters, open all your spring! 
the tuscan leaders, and their [[army]] sing, 
which follow'd [[great]] [[aeneas]] to the [[war]]: 
their arms, their numbers, and their names declare. 
a thousand youths [[youth]] brave massicus obey, 
borne in the tiger thro' the foaming sea; 
from asium brought, and cosa, by his [[care]]: 
for arms, [[light]] quivers, bows and shafts, they bear. 
fierce abas next: his [[men]] bright armor wore; 
his stern apollo's golden statue bore. 
six hundred populonia sent along, 
all skill'd in martial exercise, and [[strong]]. 
three hundred more for [[battle]] ilva joins, 
an isle renown'd for steel, and unexhausted mines. 
asylas on his prow the third appears, 
who heav'n interprets, and the wand'ring stars; 
from offer'd entrails prodigies expounds, 
and peals of thunder, with presaging sounds. 
a thousand spears in warlike order stand, 
sent by the pisans under his command. 
fair astur follows in the wat'ry field, 
proud of his manag'd horse and painted shield. 
gravisca, noisome from the neighb'ring fen, 
and his own caere, sent three hundred [[men]]; 
with those which minio's fields and pyrgi gave, 
all bred in arms, unanimous, and brave. 
thou, muse, the name of cinyras renew, 
and brave cupavo follow'd but by few; 
whose helm confess'd the lineage of the [[man]], 
and bore, with wings display'd, a silver swan. 
love was the [[fault]] of his fam'd ancestry, 
whose forms and fortunes [[fortune]] in his ensigns fly. 
for cycnus lov'd unhappy phaeton, 
and sung his loss in poplar groves, alone, 
beneath the sister shades, to soothe his [[grief]]. 
heav'n heard his [[song]], and hasten'd his relief, 
and chang'd to snowy plumes his hoary hair, 
and wing'd his flight, to chant aloft in air. 
his [[son]] cupavo brush'd the briny flood: 
upon his stern a brawny centaur stood, 
who heav'd a rock, and, threat'ning still to throw, 
with lifted hands alarm'd the seas below: 
they seem'd to [[fear]] the formidable sight, 
and roll'd their billows on, to speed his flight. 
ocnus was next, who [[led]] his native train 
of hardy warriors thro' the wat'ry plain: 
the [[son]] of manto by the tuscan stream, 
from whence the mantuan town derives the name- 
an ancient [[city]], but of mix'd descent: 
three sev'ral tribes compose the [[government]]; 
four towns are under each; but all obey 
the mantuan laws [[law]], and own the tuscan sway. 
hate to mezentius arm'd five hundred more, 
whom mincius from his sire benacus bore: 
mincius, with wreaths of reeds his forehead cover'd o'er.

these grave auletes leads: a hundred sweep 
with stretching oars at once the glassy deep. 
him and his martial train the triton bears; 
high on his poop the sea-green [[god]] appears: 
frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound, 
and at the blast the billows dance around. 
a hairy [[man]] above the waist he shows; 
a porpoise tail beneath his belly grows; 
and ends a fish: his breast the waves divides, 
and froth and foam augment the murm'ring tides. 
full thirty ships transport the chosen train 
for troy's relief, and scour the briny main. 
now was the [[world]] forsaken by the sun, 
and phoebe half her nightly [[race]] had run. 
the careful [[chief]], who never clos'd his [[eyes]], 
himself the rudder holds, the sails supplies. 
a choir of nereids meet him on the flood, 
once his own galleys, hewn from ida's wood; 
but now, as many nymphs [[nymph]], the sea they sweep, 
as rode, before, tall vessels on the deep. 
they [[know]] him from afar; and in a ring 
inclose the ship that bore the trojan [[king]]. 
cymodoce, whose voice excell'd the rest, 
above the waves advanc'd her snowy breast; 
her [[right]] hand stops the stern; her left divides 
the curling ocean, and corrects the tides. 
she spoke for all the choir, and thus began 
with pleasing words to warn th' unknowing [[man]]: 
"sleeps our lov'd [[lord]]? o goddess-born, awake! 
spread ev'ry sail, pursue your wat'ry track, 
and haste your course. your navy once were we, 
from ida's height descending to the sea; 
till turnus, as at anchor fix'd we stood, 
presum'd to violate our holy wood. 
then, loos'd from shore, we fled his fires [[fire]] profane 
(unwillingly we broke our master's chain), 
and since have sought you thro' the tuscan main. 
the mighty [[mother]] chang'd our forms to these, 
and gave us [[life]] [[immortal]] in the seas. 
but [[young]] ascanius, in his camp distress'd, 
by your insulting foes is hardly press'd. 
th' arcadian horsemen, and etrurian host, 
advance in order on the latian coast: 
to cut their way the daunian [[chief]] designs, 
before their [[troops]] can reach the trojan lines. 
thou, when the rosy morn restores the [[light]], 
first arm thy soldiers for th' ensuing [[fight]]: 
thyself the fated [[sword]] of vulcan wield, 
and bear aloft th' impenetrable shield. 
to-morrow's sun, unless my [[skill]] be [[vain]], 
shall see huge heaps of foes in [[battle]] slain." 
parting, she spoke; and with [[immortal]] [[force]] 
push'd on the vessel in her wat'ry course; 
for well she knew the way. impell'd behind, 
the ship flew forward, and outstripp'd the wind. 
the rest make up. unknowing of the cause, 
the [[chief]] admires their speed, and [[happy]] omens draws. 
then thus he pray'd, and fix'd on heav'n his [[eyes]]: 
"hear thou, [[great]] [[mother]] of the deities. 
with turrets crown'd! (on ida's holy hill 
fierce tigers, rein'd and curb'd, obey thy will.) 
firm thy own omens; lead us on to [[fight]]; 
and let thy phrygians conquer in thy [[right]]." 
he said no more. and now renewing day 
had chas'd the shadows of the night away. 
he charg'd the soldiers, with preventing [[care]], 
their flags to [[follow]], and their arms prepare; 
warn'd of th' ensuing [[fight]], and bade 'em [[hope]] the [[war]]. 
now, his lofty poop, he view'd below 
his camp incompass'd, and th' inclosing foe. 
his blazing shield, imbrac'd, he held on high; 
the camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply. 
hope arms their [[courage]]: from their tow'rs they throw 
their darts with double [[force]], and drive the foe. 
thus, at the signal giv'n, the cranes arise 
before the stormy south, and blacken all the skies [[sky]]. 
king turnus wonder'd at the [[fight]] renew'd, 
till, looking back, the trojan fleet he view'd, 
the seas with swelling canvas cover'd o'er, 
and the swift ships descending on the shore. 
the latians saw from far, with dazzled [[eyes]], 
the radiant crest that seem'd in flames to rise, 
and dart diffusive fires [[fire]] around the field, 
and the keen glitt'ring the golden shield. 
thus threat'ning comets, when by night they rise, 
shoot sanguine streams, and sadden all the skies [[sky]]: 
so sirius, flashing forth sinister lights [[light]], 
pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright: 
yet turnus with undaunted [[mind]] is bent 
to [[man]] the shores, and hinder their descent, 
and thus awakes the [[courage]] of his [[friends]]: 
"what you so long have wish'd, [[kind]] [[fortune]] sends; 
in ardent arms to meet th' invading foe: 
you find, and find him at advantage now. 
yours is the day: you need but only dare; 
your swords [[sword]] will make you masters of the [[war]]. 
your sires, your sons [[son]], your houses, and your lands [[land]], 
and dearest wifes, are all within your hands. 
be mindful of the [[race]] from whence you came, 
and emulate in arms your fathers' fame. 
now take the [[time]], while stagg'ring yet they stand 
with feet unfirm, and prepossess the strand: 
fortune befriends the bold." nor more he said, 
but balanc'd whom to leave, and whom to lead; 
then these elects, the landing to prevent; 
and those he leaves, to keep the [[city]] pent. 
meantime the trojan sends his [[troops]] ashore: 
some are by boats expos'd, by bridges more. 
with lab'ring oars they bear along the strand, 
where the tide languishes, and leap aland. 
tarchon observes the coast with careful [[eyes]], 
and, where no ford he finds, no water fries, 
nor billows with unequal murmurs roar, 
but smoothly slide along, and swell the shore, 
that course he steer'd, and thus he gave command: 
"here ply your oars, and at all hazard [[land]]: 
force on the vessel, that her keel may wound 
this hated soil, and furrow hostile ground. 
let me securely land- i ask no more; 
then sink my ships, or shatter on the shore." 
this fiery [[speech]] inflames his fearful [[friends]]: 
they tug at ev'ry oar, and ev'ry stretcher bends; 
they run their ships aground; the vessels knock, 
(thus forc'd ashore,) and tremble with the shock. 
tarchon's alone was lost, that stranded stood, 
stuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood: 
she breaks her back; the loosen'd sides give way, 
and plunge the tuscan soldiers in the sea. 
their broken oars and floating planks withstand 
their passage, while they labor to the [[land]], 
and ebbing tides bear back upon th' uncertain sand. 
now turnus leads his [[troops]] without delay, 
advancing to the margin of the sea. 
the trumpets sound: [[aeneas]] first assail'd 
the clowns new-rais'd and raw, and soon prevail'd. 
great theron fell, an omen of the [[fight]]; 
great theron, large of limbs, of giant height. 
he first in open field defied the [[prince]]: 
but armor scal'd with gold was no defense 
against the fated [[sword]], which open'd wide 
his plated shield, and pierc'd his naked side. 
next, lichas fell, who, not like others born, 
was from his wretched [[mother]] ripp'd and torn; 
sacred, o phoebus, from his birth to thee; 
for his beginning [[life]] from biting steel was [[free]]. 
not far from him was gyas laid along, 
of monstrous bulk; with cisseus fierce and [[strong]]: 
vain bulk and strength! for, when the [[chief]] assail'd, 
nor valor nor herculean arms avail'd, 
nor their fam'd [[father]], wont in [[war]] to go 
with [[great]] alcides, while he toil'd below. 
the noisy pharos next receiv'd his [[death]]: 
aeneas writh'd his dart, and stopp'd his bawling breath.

then wretched cydon had receiv'd his doom, 
who courted clytius in his beardless bloom, 
and sought with [[lust]] obscene polluted joys: 
the trojan [[sword]] had curd his [[love]] of boys, 
had not his sev'n bold brethren [[brother]] stopp'd the course 
of the fierce champions, with [[united]] [[force]]. 
sev'n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound 
from his bright shield, some on his helmet sound: 
the rest had reach'd him; but his mother's [[care]] 
prevented those, and turn'd aside in air. 
the [[prince]] then call'd achates, to supply 
the spears that knew the way to victory- 
"those fatal [[weapons]], which, inur'd to [[blood]], 
in grecian bodies [[body]] under ilium stood: 
not one of those my hand shall toss in [[vain]] 
against our foes, on this contended plain." 
he said; then seiz'd a mighty spear, and threw; 
which, wing'd with [[fate]], thro' maeon's buckler flew, 
pierc'd all the brazen plates, and reach'd his [[heart]]: 
he stagger'd with intolerable smart. 
alcanor saw; and reach'd, but reach'd in [[vain]], 
his helping hand, his [[brother]] to sustain. 
a second spear, which kept the former course, 
from the same hand, and sent with [[equal]] [[force]], 
his [[right]] arm pierc'd, and holding on, bereft 
his use of both, and pinion'd down his left. 
then numitor from his [[dead]] [[brother]] drew 
th' ill-omen'd spear, and at the trojan threw: 
preventing [[fate]] directs the lance awry, 
which, glancing, only mark'd achates' thigh. 
in [[pride]] of [[youth]] the sabine clausus came, 
and, from afar, at dryops took his aim. 
the spear flew hissing thro' the middle space, 
and pierc'd his throat, directed at his face; 
it stopp'd at once the passage of his wind, 
and the [[free]] [[soul]] to flitting air resign'd: 
his forehead was the first that struck the ground; 
lifeblood and [[life]] rush'd mingled thro' the wound. 
he slew three brothers [[brother]] of the borean [[race]], 
and three, whom ismarus, their native place, 
had sent to [[war]], but all the sons [[son]] of thrace. 
halesus, next, the bold aurunci leads: 
the [[son]] of [[neptune]] to his aid succeeds, 
conspicuous on his horse. on either hand, 
these [[fight]] to keep, and those to [[win]], the [[land]]. 
with mutual [[blood]] th' ausonian soil is dyed, 
while on its borders each their claim decide. 
as wintry winds, contending in the [[sky]], 
with [[equal]] [[force]] of lungs their titles try: 
they rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heav'n 
stands without motion, and the tide undriv'n: 
each bent to conquer, neither side to yield, 
they long suspend the [[fortune]] of the field. 
both armies [[army]] thus perform what [[courage]] can; 
foot set to foot, and mingled [[man]] to [[man]]. 
but, in another part, th' arcadian horse 
with ill [[success]] ingage the latin [[force]]: 
for, where th' impetuous torrent, rushing down, 
huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown, 
they left their coursers, and, unus'd to [[fight]] 
on foot, were scatter'd in a shameful flight. 
pallas, who with disdain and [[grief]] had view'd 
his foes pursuing, and his [[friends]] pursued, 
us'd threat'nings mix'd with pray'rs, his [[last]] resource,

with these to move their minds [[mind]], with those to [[fire]] their force

"which way, companions? whether would you run? 
by you yourselves, and mighty battles [[battle]] won, 
by my [[great]] sire, by his establish'd name, 
and early promise of my future fame; 
by my [[youth]], emulous of [[equal]] [[right]] 
to share his honors- shun ignoble flight! 
trust not your feet: your hands must hew way 
thro' yon black [[body]], and that thick array: 
't is thro' that forward path that we must come; 
there lies [[lie]] our way, and that our passage [[home]]. 
nor pow'rs above, nor destinies below 
oppress our arms: with [[equal]] [[strength]] we go, 
with mortal hands to meet a mortal foe. 
see on what foot we stand: a scanty shore, 
the sea behind, our enemies [[enemy]] before; 
no passage left, unless we swim the main; 
or, forcing these, the trojan trenches gain." 
this said, he strode with eager haste along, 
and bore amidst the thickest of the throng. 
lagus, the first he met, with [[fate]] to foe, 
had heav'd a stone of mighty weight, to throw: 
stooping, the spear descended on his chine, 
just where the bone distinguished either loin: 
it stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay, 
that scarce the victor forc'd the steel away. 
hisbon came on: but, while he mov'd too slow 
to wish'd [[revenge]], the [[prince]] prevents his blow; 
for, warding his at once, at once he press'd, 
and plung'd the fatal weapon in his breast. 
then lewd anchemolus he laid in dust, 
who stain'd his stepdam's bed with impious [[lust]]. 
and, after him, the daucian twins were slain, 
laris and thymbrus, on the latian plain; 
so wondrous like in feature, shape, and size, 
as caus'd an error in their parents' eyes- 
grateful mistake! but soon the [[sword]] decides 
the nice distinction, and their [[fate]] divides: 
for thymbrus' head was lopp'd; and laris' hand, 
dismember'd, sought its owner on the strand: 
the trembling fingers yet the fauchion strain, 
and threaten still th' intended stroke in [[vain]]. 
now, to renew the charge, th' arcadians came: 
sight of such acts, and sense of honest shame, 
and [[grief]], with anger mix'd, their minds [[mind]] inflame. 
then, with a casual blow was rhoeteus slain, 
who chanc'd, as pallas threw, to cross the plain: 
the flying spear was after ilus sent; 
but rhoeteus happen'd on a [[death]] unmeant: 
from teuthras and from tyres while he fled, 
the lance, athwart his [[body]], laid him [[dead]]: 
roll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound, 
and intercepted [[fate]], he spurn'd the ground. 
as when, in summer, welcome winds arise, 
the watchful shepherd to the forest flies, 
and fires [[fire]] the midmost plants; contagion spreads, 
and catching flames infect the neighb'ring heads; 
around the forest flies the furious blast, 
and all the leafy nation sinks at [[last]], 
and vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste; 
the pastor, pleas'd with his dire [[victory]], 
beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the [[sky]]: 
so pallas' [[troops]] their scatter'd [[strength]] unite, 
and, pouring on their foes, their [[prince]] delight. 
halesus came, fierce with [[desire]] of [[blood]]; 
but first collected in his arms he stood: 
advancing then, he plied the spear so well, 
ladon, demodocus, and pheres fell. 
around his head he toss'd his glitt'ring brand, 
and from strymonius hew'd his [[better]] hand, 
held up to guard his throat; then hurl'd a stone 
at thoas' ample front, and pierc'd the bone: 
it struck beneath the space of either eye; 
and [[blood]], and mingled brains, together fly. 
deep skill'd in future fates [[fate]], halesus' sire 
did with the [[youth]] to lonely groves retire: 
but, when the father's mortal [[race]] was run, 
dire [[destiny]] laid hold upon the [[son]], 
and haul'd him to the [[war]], to find, beneath 
th' evandrian spear, a memorable [[death]]. 
pallas th' encounter seeks, but, ere he throws, 
to tuscan tiber thus address'd his vows: 
"o [[sacred]] stream, direct my flying dart, 
and give to pass the proud halesus' heart! 
his arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear." 
pleas'd with the bribe, the [[god]] receiv'd his pray'r: 
for, while his shield protects a friend distress'd, 
the dart came driving on, and pierc'd his breast. 
but lausus, no small portion of the [[war]], 
permits not panic [[fear]] to reign too far, 
caus'd by the [[death]] of so renown'd a knight; 
but by his own [[example]] cheers the [[fight]]. 
fierce abas first he slew; abas, the stay 
of trojan hopes [[hope]], and hindrance of the day. 
the phrygian [[troops]] escap'd the greeks [[greek]] in [[vain]]: 
they, and their mix'd allies, now load the plain. 
to the rude shock of [[war]] both armies [[army]] came; 
their leaders [[equal]], and their [[strength]] the same. 
the rear so press'd the front, they could not wield 
their angry [[weapons]], to dispute the field. 
here pallas urges on, and lausus there: 
of [[equal]] [[youth]] and [[beauty]] both appear, 
but both by [[fate]] forbid to breathe their native air. 
their congress in the field [[great]] jove withstands: 
both doom'd to fall, but fall by greater hands. 
meantime juturna warns the daunian [[chief]] 
of lausus' danger, urging swift relief. 
with his driv'n chariot he divides the crowd, 
and, making to his [[friends]], thus calls aloud: 
"let none presume his needless aid to join; 
retire, and clear the field; the [[fight]] is mine: 
to this [[right]] hand is pallas only due; 
o were his [[father]] here, my just [[revenge]] to view!" 
from the forbidden space his [[men]] retir'd. 
pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir'd; 
survey'd him o'er and o'er with wond'ring sight, 
struck with his haughty mien, and tow'ring height. 
then to the [[king]]: "your empty vaunts forbear; 
success i [[hope]], and [[fate]] i cannot [[fear]]; 
alive or [[dead]], i shall deserve a name; 
jove is [[impartial]], and to both the same." 
he said, and to the void advanc'd his pace: 
pale [[horror]] sate on each arcadian face. 
then turnus, from his chariot leaping [[light]], 
address'd himself on foot to [[single]] [[fight]]. 
and, as a lion- when he spies from far 
a bull that seems to meditate the [[war]], 
bending his neck, and spurning back the sand- 
runs roaring downward from his hilly stand: 
imagine eager turnus not more slow, 
to rush from high on his unequal foe. 
young pallas, when he saw the [[chief]] advance 
within due distance of his flying lance, 
prepares to charge him first, resolv'd to try 
if [[fortune]] would his want of [[force]] supply; 
and thus to heav'n and hercules address'd: 
"alcides, once on [[earth]] evander's guest, 
his [[son]] adjures you by those holy rites, 
that hospitable board, those genial nights; 
assist my [[great]] attempt to gain this prize, 
and let proud turnus view, with dying [[eyes]], 
his ravish'd spoils." 't was heard, the [[vain]] request; 
alcides mourn'd, and stifled sighs within his breast. 
then jove, to soothe his [[sorrow]], thus began: 
"short bounds of [[life]] are set to mortal [[man]]. 
't is virtue's [[work]] alone to stretch the narrow span. 
so many sons [[son]] of gods, in bloody [[fight]], 
around the walls of troy, have lost the [[light]]: 
my own sarpedon fell beneath his foe; 
nor i, his mighty sire, could ward the blow. 
ev'n turnus shortly shall resign his breath, 
and stands already on the verge of [[death]]." 
this said, the [[god]] permits the fatal [[fight]], 
but from the latian fields averts his sight. 
now with full [[force]] his spear [[young]] pallas threw, 
and, having thrown, his shining fauchion drew 
the steel just graz'd along the shoulder joint, 
and mark'd it slightly with the glancing point, 
fierce turnus first to nearer distance drew, 
and pois'd his pointed spear, before he threw: 
then, as the winged weapon whizz'd along, 
"see now," said he, "whose arm is [[better]] strung." 
the spear kept on the fatal course, unstay'd 
by plates of ir'n, which o'er the shield were laid: 
thro' folded brass and tough bull hides it pass'd, 
his corslet pierc'd, and reach'd his [[heart]] at [[last]]. 
in [[vain]] the [[youth]] tugs at the broken wood; 
the [[soul]] comes issuing with the vital [[blood]]: 
he falls; his arms upon his [[body]] sound; 
and with his bloody teeth he bites the ground. 
turnus bestrode the corpse: "arcadians, hear," 
said he; "my message to your master bear: 
such as the sire deserv'd, the [[son]] i send; 
it costs him dear to be the phrygians' friend. 
the lifeless [[body]], tell him, i bestow, 
unask'd, to rest his wand'ring ghost below." 
he said, and trampled down with all the [[force]] 
of his left foot, and spurn'd the wretched corse; 
then snatch'd the shining belt, with gold inlaid; 
the belt eurytion's artful hands had made, 
where fifty fatal brides, express'd to sight, 
all in the compass of one mournful night, 
depriv'd their bridegrooms of returning [[light]]. 
in an ill hour insulting turnus tore 
those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore. 
o mortals, blind in [[fate]], who never [[know]] 
to bear high [[fortune]], or endure the low! 
the [[time]] shall come, when turnus, but in [[vain]], 
shall [[wish]] untouch'd the trophies of the slain; 
shall [[wish]] the fatal belt were far away, 
and curse the dire remembrance of the day. 
the [[sad]] arcadians, from th' unhappy field, 
bear back the breathless [[body]] on a shield. 
o grace and [[grief]] of war! at once restor'd, 
with praises [[praise]], to thy sire, at once deplor'd! 
one day first sent thee to the fighting field, 
beheld whole heaps of foes in [[battle]] kill'd; 
one day beheld thee [[dead]], and borne upon thy shield. 
this dismal news, not from uncertain fame, 
but [[sad]] spectators, to the hero came: 
his [[friends]] upon the brink of ruin stand, 
unless reliev'd by his victorious hand. 
he whirls his [[sword]] around, without delay, 
and hews thro' adverse foes an ample way, 
to find fierce turnus, of his [[conquest]] proud: 
evander, pallas, all that [[friendship]] ow'd 
to large deserts, are [[present]] to his [[eyes]]; 
his plighted hand, and hospitable ties. 
four sons [[son]] of sulmo, four whom ufens bred, 
he took in [[fight]], and living victims [[led]], 
to please the ghost of pallas, and expire, 
in [[sacrifice]], before his fun'ral [[fire]]. 
at magus next he threw: he stoop'd below 
the flying spear, and shunn'd the promis'd blow; 
then, creeping, clasp'd the hero's knees, and pray'd: 
"by [[young]] iulus, by thy father's shade, 
o spare my [[life]], and send me back to see 
my longing sire, and tender progeny! 
a lofty house i have, and [[wealth]] untold, 
in silver ingots, and in bars of gold: 
all these, and sums besides, which see no day, 
the ransom of this one [[poor]] [[life]] shall [[pay]]. 
if i survive, will troy the less prevail? 
a [[single]] soul's too [[light]] to turn the scale." 
he said. the hero sternly thus replied: 
"thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside, 
leave for thy children's lot. thy turnus broke 
all rules [[rule]] of [[war]] by one relentless stroke, 
when pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone 
my father's shadow, but my living [[son]]." 
thus having said, of [[kind]] remorse bereft, 
he seiz'd his helm, and dragg'd him with his left; 
then with his [[right]] hand, while his neck he wreath'd, 
up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath'd. 
apollo's [[priest]], emonides, was near; 
his holy fillets on his front appear; 
glitt'ring in arms, he shone amidst the crowd; 
much of his [[god]], more of his purple, proud. 
him the fierce trojan follow'd thro' the field: 
the holy [[coward]] fell; and, forc'd to yield, 
the [[prince]] stood o'er the [[priest]], and, at one blow, 
sent him an off'ring to the shades below. 
his arms seresthus on his shoulders bears, 
design'd a trophy to the [[god]] of wars [[war]]. 
vulcanian caeculus renews the [[fight]], 
and umbro, born upon the mountains' height. 
the champion cheers his [[troops]] t' encounter those, 
and seeks [[revenge]] himself on other foes. 
at anxur's shield he drove; and, at the blow, 
both shield and arm to ground together go. 
anxur had boasted much of magic charms, 
and [[thought]] he wore impenetrable arms, 
so made by mutter'd spells; and, from the spheres, 
had [[life]] secur'd, in [[vain]], for length of years. 
then tarquitus the field triumph trod; 
a [[nymph]] his [[mother]], his sire a [[god]]. 
exulting in bright arms, he braves the [[prince]]: 
with his protended lance he makes defense; 
bears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on, 
arrests his [[better]] hand, and drags him down; 
stands o'er the prostrate wretch, and, as he lay, 
vain tales inventing, and prepar'd to [[pray]], 
mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood, 
then sunk, and roll'd along the sand in [[blood]]. 
the vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain: 
"lie there, proud [[man]], unpitied, on the plain; 
lie there, inglorious, and without a tomb, 
far from thy [[mother]] and thy native [[home]], 
exposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey, 
or thrown for food to monsters of the sea." 
on lycas and antaeus next he ran, 
two chiefs [[chief]] of turnus, and who [[led]] his van. 
they fled for [[fear]]; with these, he chas'd along 
camers the yellow-lock'd, and numa [[strong]]; 
both [[great]] in arms, and both were [[fair]] and [[young]]. 
camers was [[son]] to volscens lately slain, 
in [[wealth]] surpassing all the latian train, 
and in amycla fix'd his silent easy reign. 
and, as aegaeon, when with heav'n he strove, 
stood opposite in arms to mighty jove; 
mov'd all his hundred hands, provok'd the [[war]], 
defied the forky lightning from afar; 
at fifty mouths his flaming breath expires, 
and flash for flash returns, and fires [[fire]] for fires [[fire]]; 
in his [[right]] hand as many swords [[sword]] he wields, 
and takes the thunder on as many shields: 
with [[strength]] like his, the trojan hero stood; 
and soon the fields with falling corps were strow'd, 
when once his fauchion found the taste of [[blood]]. 
with fury scarce to be conceiv'd, he flew 
against niphaeus, whom four coursers drew. 
they, when they see the fiery [[chief]] advance, 
and pushing at their chests his pointed lance, 
wheel'd with so swift a motion, mad with [[fear]], 
they threw their master headlong from the chair. 
they stare, they start, nor stop their course, before 
they bear the bounding chariot to the shore. 
now lucagus and liger scour the plains, 
with two [[white]] steeds; but liger holds the reins, 
and lucagus the lofty seat maintains: 
bold brethren [[brother]] both. the former wav'd in air 
his flaming [[sword]]: [[aeneas]] couch'd his spear, 
unus'd to threats, and more unus'd to [[fear]]. 
then liger thus: "thy confidence is [[vain]] 
to scape from hence, as from the trojan plain: 
nor these the steeds which diomede bestrode, 
nor this the chariot where achilles rode; 
nor venus' veil is here, near neptune's shield; 
thy fatal hour is come, and this the field." 
thus liger vainly vaunts: the trojan 
return'd his [[answer]] with his flying spear. 
as lucagus, to lash his horses, bends, 
prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends, 
prepar'd for [[fight]]; the fatal dart arrives, 
and thro' the borders of his buckler drives; 
pass'd thro' and pierc'd his groin: the deadly wound, 
cast from his chariot, roll'd him on the ground. 
whom thus the [[chief]] upbraids with scornful spite: 
"blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight; 
vain shadows did not [[force]] their swift retreat; 
but you yourself forsake your empty seat." 
he said, and seiz'd at once the loosen'd rein; 
for liger lay already on the plain, 
by the same shock: then, stretching out his hands, 
the recreant thus his wretched [[life]] demands: 
"now, by thyself, o more than mortal man! 
by her and him from whom thy breath began, 
who form'd thee thus [[divine]], i beg thee, spare 
this forfeit [[life]], and hear thy suppliant's pray'r." 
thus much he spoke, and more he would have said; 
but the stern hero turn'd aside his head, 
and cut him short: "i hear another [[man]]; 
you talk'd not thus before the [[fight]] began. 
now take your turn; and, as a [[brother]] should, 
attend your [[brother]] to the stygian flood." 
then thro' his breast his fatal [[sword]] he sent, 
and the [[soul]] issued at the gaping vent. 
as storms the skies [[sky]], and torrents tear the ground, 
thus rag'd the [[prince]], and scatter'd deaths [[death]] around. 
at length ascanius and the trojan train 
broke from the camp, so long besieg'd in [[vain]]. 
meantime the [[king]] of gods and mortal [[man]] 
held conference with his queen, and thus began: 
"my sister [[goddess]], and well-pleasing [[wife]], 
still [[think]] you venus' aid supports the strife- 
sustains her trojans- or themselves, alone, 
with inborn valor [[force]] their [[fortune]] on? 
how fierce in [[fight]], with [[courage]] undecay'd! 
judge if such warriors want [[immortal]] aid." 
to whom the [[goddess]] with the charming [[eyes]], 
soft in her tone, submissively replies: 
"why, o my sov'reign [[lord]], whose frown i [[fear]], 
and cannot, unconcern'd, your anger bear; 
why urge you thus my [[grief]]? when, if i still 
(as once i was) were mistress of your will, 
from your almighty pow'r your pleasing [[wife]] 
might gain the grace of length'ning turnus' [[life]], 
securely snatch him from the fatal [[fight]], 
and give him to his aged father's sight. 
now let him perish, since you hold it [[good]], 
and glut the trojans with his pious [[blood]]. 
yet from our lineage he derives his name, 
and, in the fourth [[degree]], from [[god]] pilumnus came; 
yet he devoutly pays [[pay]] you rites [[divine]], 
and offers daily incense at your shrine." 
then shortly thus the sov'reign [[god]] replied: 
"since in my pow'r and goodness you confide, 
if for a little space, a lengthen'd span, 
you beg reprieve for this expiring [[man]], 
i grant you leave to take your turnus hence 
from instant [[fate]], and can so far dispense. 
but, if some secret meaning lies [[lie]] beneath, 
to save the short-liv'd [[youth]] from destin'd [[death]], 
or if a farther [[thought]] you entertain, 
to [[change]] the fates [[fate]]; you feed your hopes [[hope]] in [[vain]]." 
to whom the [[goddess]] thus, with weeping [[eyes]]: 
"and what if that request, your tongue denies, 
your [[heart]] should grant; and not a short reprieve, 
but length of [[certain]] [[life]], to turnus give? 
now speedy [[death]] attends the guiltless [[youth]], 
if my presaging [[soul]] divines with [[truth]]; 
which, o! i [[wish]], might err thro' causeless fears [[fear]], 
and you (for you have pow'r) prolong his years!" 
thus having said, involv'd in clouds, she flies, 
and drives a storm before her thro' the skies [[sky]]. 
swift she descends, alighting on the plain, 
where the fierce foes a dubious [[fight]] maintain. 
of air condens'd a specter soon she made; 
and, what [[aeneas]] was, such seem'd the shade. 
adorn'd with dardan arms, the phantom bore 
his head aloft; a plumy crest he wore; 
this hand appear'd a shining [[sword]] to wield,. 
and that sustain'd an imitated shield. 
with manly mien he stalk'd along the ground, 
nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound. 
(thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight, 
or dreadful visions in our dreams [[dream]] by night.) 
the specter seems the daunian [[chief]] to dare, 
and flourishes his empty [[sword]] in air. 
at this, advancing, turnus hurl'd his spear: 
the phantom wheel'd, and seem'd to fly for [[fear]]. 
deluded turnus [[thought]] the trojan fled, 
and with [[vain]] hopes [[hope]] his haughty fancy fed. 
"whether, o [[coward]]?" (thus he calls aloud, 
nor found he spoke to wind, and chas'd a cloud,) 
"why thus forsake your bride! receive from me 
the fated [[land]] you sought so long by sea." 
he said, and, brandishing at once his blade, 
with eager pace pursued the flying shade. 
by [[chance]] a ship was fasten'd to the shore, 
which from old clusium [[king]] osinius bore: 
the plank was ready laid for safe ascent; 
for shelter there the trembling shadow bent, 
and skipp't and skulk'd, and under hatches went. 
exulting turnus, with regardless haste, 
ascends the plank, and to the galley pass'd. 
scarce had he reach'd the prow: saturnia's hand 
the haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from [[land]]. 
with wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea, 
and measures back with speed her former way. 
meantime [[aeneas]] seeks his absent foe, 
and sends his slaughter'd [[troops]] to shades below. 
the guileful phantom now forsook the shroud, 
and flew sublime, and vanish'd in a cloud. 
too late [[young]] turnus the delusion found, 
far on the sea, still making from the ground. 
then, thankless for a [[life]] redeem'd by shame, 
with sense of [[honor]] stung, and forfeit fame, 
fearful besides of what in [[fight]] had pass'd, 
his hands and haggard [[eyes]] to heav'n he cast; 
"o jove!" he cried, "for what offense have 
deserv'd to bear this endless infamy? 
whence am i forc'd, and whether am i borne? 
how, and with what reproach, shall i return? 
shall ever i behold the latian plain, 
or see laurentum's lofty tow'rs again? 
what will they say of their deserting [[chief]] 
the [[war]] was mine: i fly from their relief; 
i [[led]] to slaughter, and in slaughter leave; 
and ev'n from hence their dying groans receive. 
here, overmatch'd in [[fight]], in heaps they [[lie]]; 
there, scatter'd o'er the fields, ignobly fly. 
gape wide, o [[earth]], and draw me down alive! 
or, o ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve! 
on sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive; 
or set me shipwrack'd on some desart shore, 
where no rutulian [[eyes]] may see me more, 
unknown to [[friends]], or foes, or conscious fame, 
lest she should [[follow]], and my flight proclaim." 
thus turnus rav'd, and various fates [[fate]] revolv'd: 
the [[choice]] was doubtful, but the [[death]] resolv'd. 
and now the [[sword]], and now the sea took place, 
that to [[revenge]], and this to purge disgrace. 
sometimes he [[thought]] to swim the stormy main, 
by stretch of arms the distant shore to gain. 
thrice he the [[sword]] assay'd, and thrice the flood; 
but juno, mov'd with [[pity]], both withstood. 
and thrice repress'd his rage; [[strong]] gales supplied, 
and push'd the vessel o'er the swelling tide. 
at length she lands [[land]] him on his native shores, 
and to his father's longing arms restores. 
meantime, by jove's impulse, mezentius arm'd, 
succeeding turnus, with his ardor warm'd 
his fainting [[friends]], reproach'd their shameful flight, 
repell'd the victors, and renew'd the [[fight]]. 
against their [[king]] the tuscan [[troops]] conspire; 
such is their hate, and such their fierce [[desire]] 
of wish'd [[revenge]]: on him, and him alone, 
all hands employ'd, and all their darts are thrown. 
he, like a solid rock by seas inclos'd, 
to raging winds and roaring waves oppos'd, 
from his proud summit looking down, disdains 
their empty menace, and unmov'd remains. 
beneath his feet fell haughty hebrus [[dead]], 
then latagus, and palmus as he fled. 
at latagus a weighty stone he flung: 
his face was flatted, and his helmet rung. 
but palmus from behind receives his wound; 
hamstring'd he falls, and grovels on the ground: 
his crest and armor, from his [[body]] torn, 
thy shoulders, lausus, and thy head adorn. 
evas and mimas, both of troy, he slew. 
mimas his birth from [[fair]] theano drew, 
born on that fatal night, when, big with [[fire]], 
the queen produc'd [[young]] [[paris]] to his sire: 
but [[paris]] in the phrygian fields was slain, 
unthinking mimas on the latian plain. 
and, as a savage boar, on mountains bred, 
with forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed, 
when once he sees himself in toils inclos'd, 
by huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd- 
he whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the [[war]]; 
th' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar: 
all keep aloof, and safely shout around; 
but none presumes to give a nearer wound: 
he frets and froths, erects his bristled hide, 
and shakes a grove of lances from his side: 
not otherwise the [[troops]], with hate inspir'd, 
and just [[revenge]] against the [[tyrant]] fir'd, 
their darts with clamor at a distance drive, 
and only keep the languish'd [[war]] alive. 
from coritus came acron to the [[fight]], 
who left his spouse betroth'd, and unconsummate night. 
mezentius sees him thro' the squadrons ride, 
proud of the purple favors of his bride. 
then, as a hungry lion, who beholds 
a gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds, 
or beamy stag, that grazes on the plain- 
he runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane, 
he grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws; 
the prey lies [[lie]] panting underneath his paws: 
he fills his famish'd maw; his mouth runs o'er 
with unchew'd morsels, while he churns the gore: 
so proud mezentius rushes on his foes, 
and first unhappy acron overthrows: 
stretch'd at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground; 
the lance, besmear'd with [[blood]], lies [[lie]] broken in the wound.

then with disdain the haughty victor view'd 
orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued, 
nor [[thought]] the dastard's back deserv'd a wound, 
but, running, gain'd th' advantage of the ground: 
then turning short, he met him face to face, 
to give his victor the [[better]] grace. 
orodes falls, [[equal]] [[fight]] oppress'd: 
mezentius fix'd his foot upon his breast, 
and rested lance; and thus aloud he cries: 
"lo! here the champion of my rebels lies!" 
the fields around with io paean! ring; 
and peals of shouts applaud the conqu'ring [[king]]. 
at this the vanquish'd, with his dying breath, 
thus faintly spoke, and prophesied in [[death]]: 
"nor thou, proud [[man]], unpunish'd shalt remain: 
like [[death]] attends thee on this fatal plain." 
then, sourly smiling, thus the [[king]] replied: 
"for what belongs to me, let jove provide; 
but [[die]] thou first, whatever [[chance]] ensue." 
he said, and from the wound the weapon drew. 
a hov'ring mist came swimming o'er his sight, 
and seal'd his [[eyes]] in everlasting night. 
by caedicus, alcathous was slain; 
sacrator laid hydaspes on the plain; 
orses the [[strong]] to greater [[strength]] must yield; 
he, with parthenius, were by rapo kill'd. 
then brave messapus ericetes slew, 
who from lycaon's [[blood]] his lineage drew. 
but from his headstrong horse his [[fate]] he found, 
who threw his master, as he made a bound: 
the [[chief]], alighting, stuck him to the ground; 
then clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails: 
the trojan sinks, and neptune's [[son]] prevails. 
agis the lycian, stepping forth with [[pride]], 
to [[single]] [[fight]] the boldest foe defied; 
whom tuscan valerus by [[force]] o'ercame, 
and not belied his mighty father's fame. 
salius to [[death]] the [[great]] antronius sent: 
but the same [[fate]] the victor underwent, 
slain by nealces' hand, well-skill'd to throw 
the flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow. 
thus [[equal]] deaths [[death]] are dealt with [[equal]] [[chance]]; 
by turns they quit their ground, by turns advance: 
victors and vanquish'd, in the various field, 
nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield. 
the gods from heav'n survey the fatal strife, 
and mourn the miseries of [[human]] [[life]]. 
above the rest, two goddesses [[goddess]] appear 
concern'd for each: here [[venus]], juno there. 
amidst the crowd, infernal ate shakes 
her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes. 
once more the proud mezentius, with disdain, 
brandish'd his spear, and rush'd into the plain, 
where tow'ring in the midmost rank she stood, 
like tall orion stalking o'er the flood. 
(when with his brawny breast he cuts the waves, 
his shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves), 
or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread, 
deep fix'd in [[earth]]; in clouds he hides his head. 
the trojan [[prince]] beheld him from afar, 
and dauntless undertook the doubtful [[war]]. 
collected in his [[strength]], and like a rock, 
pois'd on his base, mezentius stood the shock. 
he stood, and, measuring first with careful [[eyes]] 
the space his spear could reach, aloud he cries: 
"my [[strong]] [[right]] hand, and [[sword]], assist my stroke! 
(those only gods mezentius will invoke.) 
his armor, from the trojan pirate torn, 
by my triumphant lausus shall be worn." 
he said; and with his utmost [[force]] he threw 
the massy spear, which, hissing as it flew, 
reach'd the celestial shield, that stopp'd the course; 
but, glancing thence, the yet unbroken [[force]] 
took a new bent obliquely, and betwixt 
the side and bowels fam'd anthores fix'd. 
anthores had from argos travel'd far, 
alcides' friend, and [[brother]] of the [[war]]; 
till, tir'd with toils, [[fair]] [[italy]] he chose, 
and in evander's palace sought repose. 
now, falling by another's wound, his [[eyes]] 
he cast to heav'n, on argos thinks [[think]], and dies. 
the pious trojan then his jav'lin sent; 
the shield gave way; thro' treble plates it went 
of solid brass, of linen trebly roll'd, 
and three bull hides which round the buckler fold. 
all these it pass'd, resistless in the course, 
transpierc'd his thigh, and spent its dying [[force]]. 
the gaping wound gush'd out a crimson flood. 
the trojan, glad with sight of hostile [[blood]], 
his faunchion drew, to closer [[fight]] address'd, 
and with new [[force]] his fainting foe oppress'd. 
his father's peril lausus view'd with [[grief]]; 
he sigh'd, he wept, he ran to his relief. 
and here, heroic [[youth]], 't is here i must 
to thy [[immortal]] memory be just, 
and sing an act so [[noble]] and so new, 
posterity will scarce [[believe]] 't is true. 
pain'd with his wound, and useless for the [[fight]], 
the [[father]] sought to save himself by flight: 
incumber'd, slow he dragg'd the spear along, 
which pierc'd his thigh, and in his buckler hung. 
the pious [[youth]], resolv'd on [[death]], below 
the lifted [[sword]] springs forth to face the foe; 
protects his parent, and prevents the blow. 
shouts of applause ran ringing thro' the field, 
to see the [[son]] the vanquish'd [[father]] shield. 
all, fir'd with gen'rous indignation, strive, 
and with a storm of darts to distance drive 
the trojan [[chief]], who, held at bay from far, 
on his vulcanian orb sustain'd the [[war]]. 
as, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind, 
the plowman, passenger, and lab'ring hind 
for shelter to the neighb'ring covert fly, 
or hous'd, or safe in hollow caverns [[lie]]; 
but, that o'erblown, when heav'n above 'em smiles, 
return to travel, and renew their toils: 
aeneas thus, o'erwhelmed on ev'ry side, 
the storm of darts, undaunted, did abide; 
and thus to lausus loud with friendly threat'ning cried:

"why wilt thou rush to [[certain]] [[death]], and rage 
in rash attempts, beyond thy tender [[age]], 
betray'd by pious [[love]]?" nor, thus forborne, 
the [[youth]] desists, but with insulting scorn 
provokes the ling'ring [[prince]], whose patience, tir'd, 
gave place; and all his breast with fury fir'd. 
for now the fates [[fate]] prepar'd their sharpen'd shears; 
and lifted high the flaming [[sword]] appears, 
which, full descending with a frightful sway, 
thro' shield and corslet forc'd th' impetuous way, 
and buried deep in his [[fair]] bosom lay. 
the purple streams thro' the thin armor strove, 
and drench'd th' imbroider'd coat his [[mother]] wove; 
and [[life]] at length forsook his heaving [[heart]], 
loth from so sweet a mansion to depart. 
but when, with [[blood]] and paleness all o'erspread, 
the pious [[prince]] beheld [[young]] lausus [[dead]], 
he griev'd; he wept; the sight an image brought 
of his own filial [[love]], a sadly pleasing [[thought]]: 
then stretch'd his hand to hold him up, and said: 
"poor hapless youth! what praises [[praise]] can be paid 
to [[love]] so [[great]], to such transcendent store 
of early worth, and sure presage of more? 
accept whate'er [[aeneas]] can afford; 
untouch'd thy arms, untaken be thy [[sword]]; 
and all that pleas'd thee living, still remain 
inviolate, and [[sacred]] to the slain. 
thy [[body]] on thy parents i bestow, 
to rest thy [[soul]], at least, if shadows [[know]], 
or have a sense of [[human]] things below. 
there to thy fellow ghosts with [[glory]] tell: 
''t was by the [[great]] [[aeneas]] hand i fell.'" 
with this, his distant [[friends]] he beckons near, 
provokes their [[duty]], and prevents their [[fear]]: 
himself assists to lift him from the ground, 
with clotted locks, and [[blood]] that well'd from out the wound.

meantime, his [[father]], now no [[father]], stood, 
and wash'd his wounds by tiber's yellow flood: 
oppress'd with anguish, panting, and o'erspent, 
his fainting limbs against an oak he leant. 
a bough his brazen helmet did sustain; 
his heavier arms lay scatter'd on the plain: 
a chosen train of [[youth]] around him stand; 
his drooping head was rested on his hand: 
his grisly beard his pensive bosom sought; 
and all on lausus ran his restless [[thought]]. 
careful, concern'd his danger to prevent, 
he much enquir'd, and many a message sent 
to warn him from the field- alas! in vain! 
behold, his mournful followers bear him slain! 
o'er his broad shield still gush'd the yawning wound, 
and drew a bloody trail along the ground. 
far off he heard their cries, far off divin'd 
the dire event, with a foreboding [[mind]]. 
with dust he sprinkled first his hoary head; 
then both his lifted hands to heav'n he spread; 
last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said: 
"what joys, alas! could this frail being give, 
that i have been so covetous to [[live]]? 
to see my [[son]], and such a [[son]], resign 
his [[life]], a ransom for preserving mine! 
and am i then preserv'd, and art [[arts]] thou lost? 
how much too dear has that redemption cost! 
't is now my bitter [[banishment]] i [[feel]]: 
this is a wound too deep for [[time]] to heal. 
my guilt thy growing virtues [[virtue]] did defame; 
my blackness blotted thy unblemish'd name. 
chas'd from a [[throne]], abandon'd, and exil'd 
for foul misdeeds, were punishments [[punishment]] too mild: 
i ow'd my [[people]] these, and, from their hate, 
with less resentment could have borne my [[fate]]. 
and yet i [[live]], and yet sustain the sight 
of hated [[men]], and of more hated [[light]]: 
but will not long." with that he rais'd from ground 
his fainting limbs, that stagger'd with his wound; 
yet, with a [[mind]] resolv'd, and unappall'd 
with pains [[pain]] or perils, for his courser call'd 
well-mouth'd, well-manag'd, whom himself did dress 
with daily [[care]], and mounted with [[success]]; 
his aid in arms, his ornament in [[peace]]. 
soothing his [[courage]] with a gentle stroke, 
the steed seem'd sensible, while thus he spoke: 
"o rhoebus, we have liv'd too long for me- 
if [[life]] and long were terms that could agree! 
this day thou either shalt bring back the head 
and bloody trophies of the trojan [[dead]]; 
this day thou either shalt [[revenge]] my woe, 
for murther'd lausus, on his cruel foe; 
or, if inexorable [[fate]] deny 
our [[conquest]], with thy conquer'd master [[die]]: 
for, after such a [[lord]], rest secure, 
thou wilt no [[foreign]] reins, or trojan load endure." 
he said; and straight th' officious courser kneels, 
to take his wonted weight. his hands he fills 
with pointed jav'lins; on his head he lac'd 
his glitt'ring helm, which terribly was grac'd 
with waving horsehair, nodding from afar; 
then spurr'd his thund'ring steed amidst the [[war]]. 
love, anguish, wrath, and [[grief]], to madness wrought, 
despair, and secret shame, and conscious [[thought]] 
of inborn worth, his lab'ring [[soul]] oppress'd, 
roll'd in his [[eyes]], and rag'd within his breast. 
then loud he call'd [[aeneas]] thrice by name: 
the loud repeated voice to glad [[aeneas]] came. 
"great jove," he said, "and the far-shooting [[god]], 
inspire thy [[mind]] to make thy challenge good!" 
he spoke no more; but hasten'd, void of [[fear]], 
and threaten'd with his long protended spear. 
to whom mezentius thus: "thy vaunts are [[vain]]. 
my lausus lies [[lie]] extended on the plain: 
he's lost! thy [[conquest]] is already won; 
the wretched sire is murther'd in the [[son]]. 
nor [[fate]] i [[fear]], but all the gods defy. 
forbear thy threats: my bus'ness is to [[die]]; 
but first receive this parting legacy." 
he said; and straight a whirling dart he sent; 
another after, and another went. 
round in a spacious ring he rides the field, 
and vainly plies th' impenetrable shield. 
thrice rode he round; and thrice [[aeneas]] wheel'd, 
turn'd as he turn'd: the golden orb withstood 
the strokes, and bore about an iron wood. 
impatient of delay, and weary grown, 
still to defend, and to defend alone, 
to wrench the darts which in his buckler [[light]], 
urg'd and o'er-labor'd in unequal [[fight]]; 
at length resolv'd, he throws with all his [[force]] 
full at the temples of the warrior horse. 
just where the stroke was aim'd, th' unerring spear 
made way, and stood transfix'd thro' either ear. 
seiz'd with unwonted [[pain]], surpris'd with fright, 
the wounded steed curvets, and, rais'd upright, 
lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind 
spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind. 
down comes the rider headlong from his height: 
his horse came after with unwieldy weight, 
and, flound'ring forward, pitching on his head, 
his lord's incumber'd shoulder overlaid. 
from either host, the mingled shouts and cries 
of trojans and rutulians rend the skies [[sky]]. 
aeneas, hast'ning, wav'd his fatal [[sword]] 
high o'er his head, with this reproachful word: 
"now; where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain 
of proud mezentius, and the lofty strain?" 
struggling, and wildly staring on the skies [[sky]], 
with scarce recover'd sight he thus replies: 
"why these insulting words, this waste of breath, 
to souls [[soul]] undaunted, and secure of [[death]]? 
't is no dishonor for the brave to [[die]], 
nor came i here with [[hope]] [[victory]]; 
nor ask i [[life]], nor fought with that design: 
as i had us'd my [[fortune]], use thou thine. 
my dying [[son]] contracted no such band; 
the gift is hateful from his murd'rer's hand. 
for this, this only favor let me sue, 
if [[pity]] can to conquer'd foes be due: 
refuse it not; but let my [[body]] have 
the [[last]] retreat of humankind, a grave. 
too well i [[know]] th' insulting people's hate; 
protect me from their vengeance after [[fate]]: 
this refuge for my [[poor]] remains provide, 
and lay my much-lov'd lausus by my side." 
he said, and to the [[sword]] his throat applied. 
the crimson stream distain'd his arms around, 
and the disdainful [[soul]] came rushing thro' the wound.

book xi

scarce had the rosy morning rais'd her head 
above the waves, and left her wat'ry bed; 
the pious [[chief]], whom double cares [[care]] attend 
for his unburied soldiers and his friend, 
yet first to heav'n perform'd a victor's vows: 
he bar'd an ancient oak of all her boughs; 
then on a rising ground the trunk he plac'd, 
which with the spoils of his [[dead]] foe he grac'd. 
the coat of arms by proud mezentius worn, 
now on a naked snag in triumph borne, 
was hung on high, and glitter'd from afar, 
a trophy [[sacred]] to the [[god]] of [[war]]. 
above his arms, fix'd on the leafless wood, 
appear'd his plumy crest, besmear'd with [[blood]]: 
his brazen buckler on the left was seen; 
truncheons of shiver'd lances hung between; 
and on the [[right]] was placed his corslet, bor'd; 
and to the neck was tied his unavailing [[sword]]. 
a crowd of chiefs [[chief]] inclose the godlike [[man]], 
who thus, conspicuous in the midst, began: 
"our toils, my [[friends]], are crown'd with sure [[success]]; 
the greater part perform'd, achieve the less. 
now [[follow]] cheerful to the trembling town; 
press but an entrance, and presume it won. 
fear is no more, for fierce mezentius lies [[lie]], 
as the first fruits of [[war]], a [[sacrifice]]. 
turnus shall fall extended on the plain, 
and, in this omen, is already slain. 
prepar'd in arms, pursue your [[happy]] [[chance]]; 
that none unwarn'd may plead his ignorance, 
and i, at heav'n's appointed hour, may find 
your warlike ensigns waving in the wind. 
meantime the rites and fun'ral pomps prepare, 
due to your [[dead]] companions of the [[war]]: 
the [[last]] [[respect]] the living can bestow, 
to shield their shadows from contempt below. 
that conquer'd [[earth]] be theirs, for which they fought, 
and which for us with their own [[blood]] they bought; 
but first the corpse of our unhappy friend 
to the [[sad]] [[city]] of evander send, 
who, not inglorious, in his age's bloom, 
was hurried hence by too severe a doom." 
thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way, 
where, new in [[death]], lamented pallas lay. 
acoetes watch'd the corpse; whose [[youth]] deserv'd 
the father's trust; and now the [[son]] he serv'd 
with [[equal]] [[faith]], but less auspicious [[care]]. 
th' attendants of the slain his [[sorrow]] share. 
a troop of trojans mix'd with these appear, 
and mourning matrons with dishevel'd hair. 
soon as the [[prince]] appears, they raise a cry; 
all beat their breasts, and echoes rend the [[sky]]. 
they rear his drooping forehead from the ground; 
but, when [[aeneas]] view'd the grisly wound 
which pallas in his manly bosom bore, 
and the [[fair]] flesh distain'd with purple gore; 
first, melting into tears, the pious [[man]] 
deplor'd so [[sad]] a sight, then thus began: 
"unhappy youth! when [[fortune]] gave the rest 
of my full wishes [[wish]], she refus'd the best! 
she came; but brought not thee along, to bless 
my longing [[eyes]], and share in my [[success]]: 
she grudg'd thy safe return, the triumphs due 
to prosp'rous valor, in the [[public]] view. 
not thus i promis'd, when thy [[father]] lent 
thy needless succor with a [[sad]] [[consent]]; 
embrac'd me, parting for th' etrurian [[land]], 
and sent me to possess a large command. 
he warn'd, and from his own [[experience]] told, 
our foes were warlike, disciplin'd, and bold. 
and now perhaps, in hopes [[hope]] of thy return, 
rich odors on his loaded altars burn, 
while we, with [[vain]] officious pomp, prepare 
to send him back his portion of the [[war]], 
a bloody breathless [[body]], which can owe 
no farther debt, but to the pow'rs below. 
the wretched [[father]], ere his [[race]] is run, 
shall view the fun'ral honors of his [[son]]. 
these are my triumphs of the latian [[war]], 
fruits of my plighted [[faith]] and boasted care! 
and yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see 
a [[son]] whose [[death]] disgrac'd his ancestry; 
thou shalt not blush, old [[man]], however griev'd: 
thy pallas no dishonest wound receiv'd. 
he died no [[death]] to make thee [[wish]], too late, 
thou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful [[fate]]: 
but what a champion has th' ausonian coast, 
and what a friend hast thou, ascanius, lost!" 
thus having mourn'd, he gave the word around, 
to raise the breathless [[body]] from the ground; 
and chose a thousand horse, the flow'r of all 
his warlike [[troops]], to wait the [[funeral]], 
to bear him back and share evander's [[grief]]: 
a well-becoming, but a [[weak]] relief. 
of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier, 
then on their shoulders the [[sad]] burden rear. 
the [[body]] on this rural hearse is borne: 
strew'd leaves and [[funeral]] greens the bier adorn. 
all pale he lies [[lie]], and looks a lovely flow'r, 
new cropp'd by virgin hands, to dress the bow'r: 
unfaded yet, but yet unfed below, 
no more to [[mother]] [[earth]] or the green stern shall owe. 
then two [[fair]] vests, of wondrous [[work]] and cost, 
of purple woven, and with gold emboss'd, 
for ornament the trojan hero brought, 
which with her hands sidonian dido wrought. 
one vest array'd the corpse; and one they spread 
o'er his clos'd [[eyes]], and wrapp'd around his head, 
that, when the yellow hair in flame should fall, 
the catching [[fire]] might burn the golden caul. 
besides, the spoils of foes in [[battle]] slain, 
when he descended on the latian plain; 
arms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are [[led]] 
in long array- th' achievements of the [[dead]]. 
then, pinion'd with their hands behind, appear 
th' unhappy captives, marching in the rear, 
appointed off'rings in the victor's name, 
to sprinkle with their [[blood]] the fun'ral flame. 
inferior trophies by the chiefs [[chief]] are borne; 
gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn; 
and [[fair]] inscriptions fix'd, and titles [[read]] 
of latian leaders conquer'd by the [[dead]]. 
acoetes on his pupil's corpse attends, 
with feeble steps, supported by his [[friends]]. 
pausing at ev'ry pace, in [[sorrow]] drown'd, 
betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground; 
where grov'ling while he lies [[lie]] in deep despair, 
he beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair. 
the champion's chariot next is seen to roll, 
besmear'd with hostile [[blood]], and honorably foul. 
to close the pomp, aethon, the steed of [[state]], 
is [[led]], the fun'rals of his [[lord]] to wait. 
stripp'd of his trappings, with a sullen pace 
he walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face. 
the lance of pallas, and the crimson crest, 
are borne behind: the victor seiz'd the rest. 
the march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound; 
the pikes and lances trail along the ground. 
thus while the trojan and arcadian horse 
to pallantean tow'rs direct their course, 
in long procession rank'd, the pious [[chief]] 
stopp'd in the rear, and gave a vent to [[grief]]: 
"the [[public]] [[care]]," he said, "which [[war]] attends, 
diverts our [[present]] woes, at least suspends. 
peace with the manes of [[great]] pallas dwell! 
hail, holy relics! and a [[last]] farewell!" 
he said no more, but, inly thro' he mourn'd, 
restrained his tears, and to the camp return'd. 
now suppliants, from laurentum sent, demand 
a truce, with olive branches in their hand; 
obtest his clemency, and from the plain 
beg leave to draw the bodies [[body]] of their slain. 
they plead, that none those [[common]] rites deny 
to conquer'd foes that in [[fair]] [[battle]] [[die]]. 
all cause of hate was ended in their [[death]]; 
nor could he [[war]] with bodies [[body]] void of breath. 
a [[king]], they hop'd, would hear a king's request, 
whose [[son]] he once was call'd, and once his guest. 
their suit, which was too just to be denied, 
the hero grants, and farther thus replied: 
"o latian princes [[prince]], how severe a [[fate]] 
in causeless quarrels has involv'd your [[state]], 
and arm'd against an unoffending [[man]], 
who sought your [[friendship]] ere the [[war]] began! 
you beg a truce, which i would gladly give, 
not only for the slain, but those who [[live]]. 
i came not hither but by heav'n's command, 
and sent by [[fate]] to share the latian [[land]]. 
nor wage i wars [[war]] [[unjust]]: your [[king]] denied 
my proffer'd [[friendship]], and my promis'd bride; 
left me for turnus. turnus then should try 
his cause in arms, to conquer or to [[die]]. 
my [[right]] and his are in dispute: the slain 
fell without [[fault]], our quarrel to maintain. 
in [[equal]] arms let us alone contend; 
and let him vanquish, whom his fates [[fate]] befriend. 
this is the way (so tell him) to possess 
the [[royal]] virgin, and restore the [[peace]]. 
bear this message back, with ample leave, 
that your slain [[friends]] may fun'ral rites receive." 
thus having said- th' embassadors, amaz'd, 
stood mute a while, and on each other gaz'd. 
drances, their [[chief]], who harbor'd in his breast 
long hate to turnus, as his foe profess'd, 
broke [[silence]] first, and to the godlike [[man]], 
with graceful action bowing, thus began: 
"auspicious [[prince]], in arms a mighty name, 
but yet whose actions far transcend your fame; 
would i your [[justice]] or your [[force]] express, 
thought can but [[equal]]; and all words are less. 
your [[answer]] we shall thankfully relate, 
and favors granted to the latian [[state]]. 
if wish'd [[success]] our labor shall attend, 
think [[peace]] concluded, and the [[king]] your friend: 
let turnus leave the realm to your command, 
and seek [[alliance]] in some other [[land]]: 
build you the [[city]] which your fates [[fate]] assign; 
we shall be proud in the [[great]] [[work]] to join." 
thus drances; and his words so well persuade 
the rest impower'd, that soon a truce is made. 
twelve days the term allow'd: and, during those, 
latians and trojans, now no longer foes, 
mix'd in the woods, for fun'ral piles prepare 
to fell the timber, and forget the [[war]]. 
loud axes thro' the groaning groves resound; 
oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground; 
first fall from high; and some the trunks receive 
in loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave. 
and now the fatal news by fame is blown 
thro' the short circuit of th' arcadian town, 
of pallas slain- by fame, which just before 
his triumphs on distended pinions bore. 
rushing from out the gate, the [[people]] stand, 
each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand. 
wildly they stare, distracted with amaze: 
the fields are lighten'd with a fiery blaze, 
that cast a sullen splendor on their [[friends]], 
the marching troop which their [[dead]] [[prince]] attends. 
both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry; 
the matrons from the walls with shrieks reply, 
and their mix'd mourning rends the vaulted [[sky]]. 
the town is fill'd with tumult and with tears, 
till the loud clamors reach evander's ears: 
forgetful of his [[state]], he runs along, 
with a disorder'd pace, and cleaves the throng; 
falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies [[lie]], 
with silent [[grief]], that speaks but at his [[eyes]]. 
short sighs and sobs succeed; till [[sorrow]] breaks 
a passage, and at once he weeps and speaks: 
"o pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word, 
to [[fight]] with caution, not to tempt the sword! 
i warn'd thee, but in [[vain]]; for well i knew 
what perils youthful ardor would pursue, 
that boiling [[blood]] would carry thee too far, 
young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war! 
o curst essay of arms, disastrous doom, 
prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come! 
hard elements of unauspicious [[war]], 
vain vows to heav'n, and unavailing care! 
thrice [[happy]] thou, dear partner of my bed, 
whose holy [[soul]] the stroke of [[fortune]] fled, 
praescious of ills, and leaving me behind, 
to drink the dregs of [[life]] by [[fate]] assign'd! 
beyond the goal of [[nature]] i have gone: 
my pallas late set out, but reach'd too soon. 
if, for my league against th' ausonian [[state]], 
amidst their [[weapons]] i had found my [[fate]], 
(deserv'd from them,) then i had been return'd 
a breathless victor, and my [[son]] had mourn'd. 
yet will i not my trojan friend upbraid, 
nor grudge th' [[alliance]] i so gladly made. 
't was not his [[fault]], my pallas fell so [[young]], 
but my own crime, for having liv'd too long. 
yet, since the gods had destin'd him to [[die]], 
at least he [[led]] the way to [[victory]]: 
first for his [[friends]] he won the fatal shore, 
and sent whole herds of slaughter'd foes before; 
a [[death]] too [[great]], too glorious to deplore. 
nor will i add new honors to thy grave, 
content with those the trojan hero gave: 
that [[funeral]] pomp thy phrygian [[friends]] design'd, 
in which the tuscan chiefs [[chief]] and [[army]] join'd. 
great spoils and trophies, gain'd by thee, they bear: 
then let thy own achievements be thy share. 
even thou, o turnus, hadst a trophy stood, 
whose mighty trunk had [[better]] grac'd the wood, 
if pallas had arriv'd, with [[equal]] length 
of years, to match thy bulk with [[equal]] [[strength]]. 
but why, unhappy [[man]], dost thou detain 
these [[troops]], to view the tears thou shedd'st in [[vain]]? 
go, [[friends]], this message to your [[lord]] relate: 
tell him, that, if i bear my bitter [[fate]], 
and, after pallas' [[death]], [[live]] ling'ring on, 
't is to behold his vengeance for my [[son]]. 
i stay for turnus, whose devoted head 
is owing to the living and the [[dead]]. 
my [[son]] and i expect it from his hand; 
't is all that he can give, or we demand. 
joy is no more; but i would gladly go, 
to greet my pallas with such news below." 
the morn had now dispell'd the shades of night, 
restoring toils, when she restor'd the [[light]]. 
the trojan [[king]] and tuscan [[chief]] command 
to raise the piles along the winding strand. 
their [[friends]] convey the [[dead]] fun'ral fires [[fire]]; 
black smold'ring smoke from the green wood expires; 
the [[light]] of heav'n is chok'd, and the new day retires. 
then thrice around the kindled piles they go 
(for ancient custom had ordain'd it so) 
thrice horse and foot about the fires [[fire]] are [[led]]; 
and thrice, with loud laments, they hail the [[dead]]. 
tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground, 
and drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound. 
amid the blaze, their pious brethren [[brother]] throw 
the spoils, in [[battle]] taken from the foe: 
helms, bits emboss'd, and swords [[sword]] of shining steel; 
one casts a target, one a chariot wheel; 
some to their fellows their own arms restore: 
the fauchions which in luckless [[fight]] they bore, 
their bucklers pierc'd, their darts bestow'd in [[vain]], 
and shiver'd lances gather'd from the plain. 
whole herds of offer'd bulls, about the [[fire]], 
and bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire. 
around the piles a careful troop attends, 
to watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning [[friends]];

ling'ring along the shore, till dewy night 
new decks the face of heav'n with starry [[light]]. 
the conquer'd latians, with like pious [[care]], 
piles without number for their [[dead]] prepare. 
part in the places where they fell are laid; 
and part are to the neighb'ring fields convey'd. 
the corps of kings [[king]], and captains of renown, 
borne off in [[state]], are buried in the town; 
the rest, unhonor'd, and without a name, 
are cast a [[common]] heap to feed the flame. 
trojans and latians vie with like desires [[desire]] 
to make the field of [[battle]] shine with fires [[fire]], 
and the promiscuous blaze to heav'n aspires. 
now had the morning thrice renew'd the [[light]], 
and thrice dispell'd the shadows of the night, 
when those who round the wasted fires [[fire]] remain, 
perform the [[last]] [[sad]] office to the slain. 
they rake the yet warm ashes from below; 
these, and the bones unburn'd, in [[earth]] bestow; 
these relics with their [[country]] rites they grace, 
and raise a mount of turf to mark the place. 
but, in the palace of the [[king]], appears 
a scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears. 
maids, matrons, widows, mix their [[common]] moans; 
orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons [[son]]. 
all in that universal [[sorrow]] share, 
and curse the cause of this unhappy [[war]]: 
a broken league, a bride unjustly sought, 
a [[crown]] usurp'd, which with their [[blood]] is bought! 
these are the crimes with which they load the name 
of turnus, and on him alone exclaim: 
"let him who lords [[lord]] it o'er th' ausonian [[land]] 
engage the trojan hero hand to hand: 
his is the gain; our lot is but to serve; 
't is just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve." 
this drances aggravates; and adds, with spite: 
"his foe expects, and dares him to the [[fight]]." 
nor turnus wants a party, to support 
his cause and credit in the latian court. 
his former acts secure his [[present]] fame, 
and the queen shades him with her mighty name. 
while thus their factious minds [[mind]] with fury burn, 
the legates from th' aetolian [[prince]] return: 
sad news they bring, that, after all the cost 
and [[care]] employ'd, their embassy is lost; 
that diomedes refus'd his aid in [[war]], 
unmov'd with presents [[present]], and as deaf to pray'r. 
some new [[alliance]] must elsewhere be sought, 
or [[peace]] with troy on hard conditions bought. 
latinus, sunk in [[sorrow]], finds too late, 
a [[foreign]] [[son]] is pointed out by [[fate]]; 
and, till [[aeneas]] shall lavinia wed, 
the wrath of heav'n is hov'ring o'er his head. 
the gods, he saw, espous'd the juster side, 
when late their titles in the field were tried: 
witness the fresh laments, and fun'ral tears undried. 
thus, full of anxious [[thought]], he summons all 
the latian senate to the council hall. 
the princes [[prince]] come, commanded by their head, 
and crowd the paths that to the palace lead. 
supreme in pow'r, and reverenc'd for his years, 
he takes the [[throne]], and in the midst appears. 
majestically [[sad]], he sits in [[state]], 
and bids his envoys their [[success]] relate. 
when venulus began, the murmuring sound 
was hush'd, and [[sacred]] [[silence]] reign'd around. 
"we have," said he, "perform'd your high command, 
and pass'd with peril a long tract of [[land]]: 
we reach'd the place desir'd; with wonder fill'd, 
the grecian tents and rising tow'rs beheld. 
great diomede has compass'd round with walls 
the [[city]], which argyripa he calls, 
from his own argos nam'd. we touch'd, with joy, 
the [[royal]] hand that raz'd unhappy troy. 
when introduc'd, our presents [[present]] first we bring, 
then crave an instant audience from the [[king]]. 
his leave obtain'd, our native soil we name, 
and tell th' important cause for which we came. 
attentively he heard us, while we spoke; 
then, with soft accents, and a pleasing look, 
made this return: 'ausonian [[race]], of old 
renown'd for [[peace]], and for an [[age]] of gold, 
what madness has your alter'd minds [[mind]] possess'd, 
to [[change]] for [[war]] hereditary rest, 
solicit arms unknown, and tempt the [[sword]], 
a needless ill your [[ancestors]] abhorr'd? 
we- for myself i speak, and all the name 
of grecians, who to troy's destruction came, 
omitting those who were in [[battle]] slain, 
or borne by rolling simois to the main- 
not one but suffer'd, and too dearly bought 
the prize of [[honor]] which in arms he sought; 
some doom'd to [[death]], and some in [[exile]] driv'n. 
outcasts, abandon'd by the [[care]] of heav'n; 
so worn, so wretched, so despis'd a crew, 
as ev'n old priam might with [[pity]] view. 
witness the vessels by minerva toss'd 
in storms; the vengeful capharean coast; 
th' euboean rocks! the [[prince]], whose [[brother]] [[led]] 
our armies [[army]] to [[revenge]] his injur'd bed, 
in [[egypt]] lost! [[ulysses]] with his [[men]] 
have seen charybdis and the cyclops' den. 
why should i name idomeneus, in [[vain]] 
restor'd to scepters, and expell'd again? 
or [[young]] achilles, by his rival slain? 
ev'n he, the [[king]] of [[men]], the foremost name 
of all the greeks [[greek]], and most renown'd by fame, 
the proud revenger of another's [[wife]], 
yet by his own adult'ress lost his [[life]]; 
fell at his threshold; and the spoils of troy 
the foul polluters of his bed enjoy. 
the gods have envied me the sweets of [[life]], 
my much lov'd [[country]], and my more lov'd [[wife]]: 
banish'd from both, i mourn; while in the [[sky]], 
transform'd to birds, my lost companions fly: 
hov'ring about the coasts, they make their moan, 
and cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own. 
what squalid specters, in the [[dead]] of night, 
break my short sleep, and skim before my sight! 
i might have promis'd to myself those harms, 
mad as i was, when i, with mortal arms, 
presum'd against [[immortal]] pow'rs to move, 
and violate with wounds the queen of [[love]]. 
such arms this hand shall never more employ; 
no hate remains with me to ruin'd troy. 
i [[war]] not with its dust; nor am i glad 
to [[think]] of [[past]] events, or [[good]] or [[bad]]. 
your presents [[present]] i return: whate'er you bring 
to buy my [[friendship]], send the trojan [[king]]. 
we met in [[fight]]; i [[know]] him, to my cost: 
with what a whirling [[force]] his lance he toss'd! 
heav'ns! what a spring was in his arm, to throw! 
how high he held his shield, and rose at ev'ry blow! 
had troy produc'd two more his match in might, 
they would have chang'd the [[fortune]] of the [[fight]]: 
th' [[invasion]] of the greeks [[greek]] had been return'd, 
our [[empire]] wasted, and our cities [[city]] burn'd. 
the long defense the trojan [[people]] made, 
the [[war]] protracted, and the siege delay'd, 
were due to hector's and this hero's hand: 
both brave alike, and [[equal]] in command; 
aeneas, not inferior in the field, 
in pious reverence to the gods excell'd. 
make [[peace]], ye latians, and avoid with [[care]] 
th' impending dangers of a fatal [[war]].' 
he said no more; but, with this cold excuse, 
refus'd th' [[alliance]], and advis'd a truce." 
thus venulus concluded his report. 
a jarring murmur fill'd the factious court: 
as, when a torrent rolls with rapid [[force]], 
and dashes o'er the stones that stop the course, 
the flood, constrain'd within a scanty space, 
roars horrible along th' uneasy [[race]]; 
white foam in gath'ring eddies floats around; 
the rocky shores rebellow to the sound. 
the murmur ceas'd: then from his lofty [[throne]] 
the [[king]] invok'd the gods, and thus begun: 
"i [[wish]], ye latins, what we now debate 
had been resolv'd before it was too late. 
much [[better]] had it been for you and me, 
unforc'd by this our [[last]] necessity, 
to have been earlier [[wise]], than now to call 
a council, when the foe surrounds the wall. 
o [[citizens]], we wage unequal [[war]], 
with [[men]] not only heav'n's peculiar [[care]], 
but heav'n's own [[race]]; unconquer'd in the field, 
or, conquer'd, yet unknowing how to yield. 
what hopes [[hope]] you had in diomedes, lay down: 
our hopes [[hope]] must center on ourselves alone. 
yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how [[vain]], 
you see too well; nor need my words explain. 
vanquish'd without resource; laid flat by [[fate]]; 
factions within, a foe without the gate! 
not but i grant that all perform'd their parts 
with manly [[force]], and with undaunted hearts [[heart]]: 
with our [[united]] [[strength]] the [[war]] we wag'd; 
with [[equal]] numbers, [[equal]] arms, engag'd. 
you see th' event.- now hear what i propose, 
to save our [[friends]], and satisfy our foes. 
a tract of [[land]] the latins have possess'd 
along the tiber, stretching to the west, 
which now rutulians and auruncans till, 
and their mix'd cattle graze the fruitful hill. 
those mountains fill'd with firs, that lower [[land]], 
if you [[consent]], the trojan shall command, 
call'd into part of what is ours; and there, 
on terms agreed, the [[common]] [[country]] share. 
there let'em build and settle, if they please; 
unless they choose once more to cross the seas, 
in search of seats remote from [[italy]], 
and from unwelcome inmates set us [[free]]. 
then twice ten galleys let us build with speed, 
or twice as many more, if more they need. 
materials are at hand; a well-grown wood 
runs [[equal]] with the margin of the flood: 
let them the number and the form assign; 
the [[care]] and cost of all the stores be mine. 
to treat the [[peace]], a hundred senators 
shall be commission'd hence with ample pow'rs, 
with olive the presents [[present]] they shall bear, 
a purple robe, a [[royal]] iv'ry chair, 
and all the marks of sway that latian monarchs wear, 
and sums of gold. among yourselves debate 
this [[great]] affair, and save the sinking [[state]]." 
then drances took the word, who grudg'd, long since, 
the rising glories of the daunian [[prince]]. 
factious and [[rich]], bold at the council board, 
but cautious in the field, he shunn'd the [[sword]]; 
a close caballer, and tongue-valiant [[lord]]. 
noble his [[mother]] was, and near the [[throne]]; 
but, what his father's parentage, unknown. 
he rose, and took th' advantage of the times [[time]], 
to load [[young]] turnus with invidious crimes. 
"such truths [[truth]], o [[king]]," said he, "your words contain, 
as strike the sense, and all replies are [[vain]]; 
nor are your [[loyal]] subjects [[subject]] now to seek 
what [[common]] needs require, but [[fear]] to speak. 
let him give leave of [[speech]], that haughty [[man]], 
whose [[pride]] this unauspicious [[war]] began; 
for whose [[ambition]] (let me dare to say, 
fear set apart, tho' [[death]] is in my way) 
the plains of latium run with [[blood]] around. 
so many valiant heroes bite the ground; 
dejected [[grief]] in ev'ry face appears; 
a town in mourning, and a [[land]] in tears; 
while he, th' undoubted author of our harms, 
the [[man]] who menaces the gods with arms, 
yet, after all his boasts, forsook the [[fight]], 
and sought his safety in ignoble flight. 
now, [[best]] of kings [[king]], since you propose to send 
such bounteous presents [[present]] to your trojan friend; 
add yet a greater at our joint request, 
one which he values more than all the rest: 
give him the [[fair]] lavinia for his bride; 
with that [[alliance]] let the league be tied, 
and for the bleeding [[land]] a lasting [[peace]] provide. 
let insolence no longer awe the [[throne]]; 
but, with a father's [[right]], bestow your own. 
for this maligner of the general [[good]], 
if still we [[fear]] his [[force]], he must be woo'd; 
his haughty godhead we with pray'rs implore, 
your scepter to release, and our just rights [[right]] restore. 
o cursed cause of all our ills, must we 
wage wars [[war]] [[unjust]], and fall in [[fight]], for thee! 
what [[right]] hast thou to [[rule]] the latian [[state]], 
and send us out to meet our [[certain]] [[fate]]? 
't is a destructive [[war]]: from turnus' hand 
our [[peace]] and [[public]] safety we demand. 
let the [[fair]] bride to the brave [[chief]] remain; 
if not, the [[peace]], without the pledge, is [[vain]]. 
turnus, i [[know]] you [[think]] me not your friend, 
nor will i much with your [[belief]] contend: 
i beg your greatness not to give the [[law]] 
in others' realms, but, beaten, to withdraw. 
pity your own, or [[pity]] our estate; 
nor twist our fortunes [[fortune]] with your sinking [[fate]]. 
your interest is, the [[war]] should never cease; 
but we have [[felt]] enough to [[wish]] the [[peace]]: 
a [[land]] exhausted to the [[last]] remains, 
depopulated towns, and driven plains. 
yet, if [[desire]] of fame, and thirst of pow'r, 
a beauteous princess, with a [[crown]] in dow'r, 
so [[fire]] your [[mind]], in arms assert your [[right]], 
and meet your foe, who dares you to the [[fight]]. 
mankind, it seems, is made for you alone; 
we, but the slaves [[slave]] who mount you to the [[throne]]: 
a base ignoble crowd, without a name, 
unwept, unworthy, of the fun'ral flame, 
by [[duty]] bound to forfeit each his [[life]], 
that turnus may possess a [[royal]] [[wife]]. 
permit not, mighty [[man]], so mean a crew 
should share such triumphs, and detain from you 
the post of [[honor]], your undoubted due. 
rather alone your matchless [[force]] employ, 
to [[merit]] what alone you must enjoy." 
these words, so full of malice mix'd with art [[arts]], 
inflam'd with rage the youthful hero's [[heart]]. 
then, groaning from the bottom of his breast, 
he heav'd for wind, and thus his wrath express'd: 
"you, drances, never want a stream of words, 
then, when the [[public]] need requires our swords [[sword]]. 
first in the council hall to steer the [[state]], 
and ever foremost in a tongue-debate, 
while our [[strong]] walls secure us from the foe, 
ere yet with [[blood]] our ditches overflow: 
but let the potent orator declaim, 
and with the brand of [[coward]] blot my name; 
free leave is giv'n him, when his fatal hand 
has cover'd with more corps the sanguine strand, 
and high as mine his tow'ring trophies stand. 
if any [[doubt]] remains, who dares the most, 
let us decide it at the trojan's cost, 
and issue both abreast, where [[honor]] calls- 
foes are not far to seek without the walls- 
unless his noisy tongue can only [[fight]], 
and feet were giv'n him but to speed his flight. 
i beaten from the field? i forc'd away? 
who, but so known a dastard, dares to say? 
had he but ev'n beheld the [[fight]], his [[eyes]] 
had witness'd for me what his tongue denies: 
what heaps of trojans by this hand were slain, 
and how the bloody tiber swell'd the main. 
all saw, but he, th' arcadian [[troops]] retire 
in scatter'd squadrons, and their [[prince]] expire. 
the giant brothers [[brother]], in their camp, have found, 
i was not forc'd with ease to quit my ground. 
not such the trojans tried me, when, inclos'd, 
i singly their [[united]] arms oppos'd: 
first forc'd an entrance thro' their thick array; 
then, glutted with their slaughter, freed my way. 
't is a destructive [[war]]? so let it be, 
but to the phrygian pirate, and to thee! 
meantime proceed to fill the people's ears 
with false reports, their minds [[mind]] with panic fears [[fear]]: 
extol the [[strength]] of a twice-conquer'd [[race]]; 
our foes encourage, and our [[friends]] debase. 
believe thy fables, and the trojan town 
triumphant stands; the grecians are o'erthrown; 
suppliant at hector's feet achilles lies [[lie]], 
and diomede from fierce [[aeneas]] flies. 
say rapid aufidus with awful dread 
runs backward from the sea, and hides his head, 
when the [[great]] trojan on his bank appears; 
for that's as true as thy dissembled fears [[fear]] 
of my [[revenge]]. dismiss that vanity: 
thou, drances, art [[arts]] below a [[death]] from me. 
let that vile [[soul]] in that vile [[body]] rest; 
the lodging is well worthy of the guest. 
"now, [[royal]] [[father]], to the [[present]] [[state]] 
of our affairs, and of this high debate: 
if in your arms thus early you diffide, 
and [[think]] your [[fortune]] is already tried; 
if one defeat has brought us down so low, 
as never more in fields to meet the foe; 
then i conclude for [[peace]]: 't is [[time]] to treat, 
and [[lie]] like vassals at the victor's feet. 
but, o! if any ancient [[blood]] remains, 
one drop of all our fathers', in our veins, 
that [[man]] would i prefer before the rest, 
who dar'd his [[death]] with an undaunted breast; 
who comely fell, by no dishonest wound, 
to shun that sight, and, dying, gnaw'd the ground. 
but, if we still have fresh recruits in store, 
if our confederates can afford us more; 
if the contended field we bravely fought, 
and not a bloodless [[victory]] was bought; 
their losses equal'd ours; and, for their slain, 
with [[equal]] fires [[fire]] they fill'd the shining plain; 
why thus, unforc'd, should we so tamely yield, 
and, ere the trumpet sounds, resign the field? 
good unexpected, evils [[evil]] unforeseen, 
appear by turns, as [[fortune]] shifts the scene: 
some, rais'd aloft, come tumbling down amain; 
then fall so hard, they bound and rise again. 
if diomede refuse his aid to lend, 
the [[great]] messapus yet remains our friend: 
tolumnius, who foretells events, is ours; 
th' italian chiefs [[chief]] and princes [[prince]] join their pow'rs: 
nor least in number, nor in name the [[last]], 
your own brave subjects [[subject]] have your cause embrac'd 
above the rest, the volscian amazon 
contains an [[army]] in herself alone, 
and heads a squadron, terrible to sight, 
with glitt'ring shields, in brazen armor bright. 
yet, if the foe a [[single]] [[fight]] demand, 
and i alone the [[public]] [[peace]] withstand; 
if you [[consent]], he shall not be refus'd, 
nor find a hand to [[victory]] unus'd. 
this new achilles, let him take the field, 
with fated armor, and vulcanian shield! 
for you, my [[royal]] [[father]], and my fame, 
i, turnus, not the least of all my name, 
devote my [[soul]]. he calls me hand to hand, 
and i alone will [[answer]] his demand. 
drances shall rest secure, and neither share 
the danger, nor divide the prize of [[war]]." 
while they debate, nor these nor those will yield, 
aeneas draws his forces [[force]] to the field, 
and moves his camp. the scouts with flying speed 
return, and thro' the frighted [[city]] spread 
th' unpleasing news, the trojans are descried, 
in [[battle]] marching by the river side, 
and bending to the town. they take th' alarm: 
some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm. 
th' impetuous [[youth]] press forward to the field; 
they clash the [[sword]], and clatter on the shield: 
the fearful matrons raise a screaming cry; 
old feeble [[men]] with fainter groans reply; 
a jarring sound results, and mingles in the [[sky]], 
like that of swans remurm'ring to the floods, 
or birds of diff'ring kinds [[kind]] in hollow woods. 
turnus th' [[occasion]] takes, and cries aloud: 
"talk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd: 
declaim in [[praise]] of [[peace]], when danger calls, 
and the fierce foes in arms approach the walls." 
he said, and, turning short, with speedy pace, 
casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place: 
"thou, volusus, the volscian [[troops]] command 
to mount; and lead thyself our ardean band. 
messapus and catillus, post your [[force]] 
along the fields, to charge the trojan horse. 
some guard the passes, others [[man]] the wall; 
drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call." 
they swarm from ev'ry quarter of the town, 
and with disorder'd haste the rampires [[crown]]. 
good old latinus, when he saw, too late, 
the gath'ring storm just breaking on the [[state]], 
dismiss'd the council till a fitter [[time]], 
and own'd his easy temper as his crime, 
who, forc'd against his [[reason]], had complied 
to break the treaty for the promis'd bride. 
some [[help]] to sink new trenches; others aid 
to ram the stones, or raise the palisade. 
hoarse trumpets sound th' alarm; around the walls 
runs a distracted crew, whom their [[last]] labor calls. 
a [[sad]] procession in the streets is seen, 
of matrons, that attend the [[mother]] queen: 
high in her chair she sits, and, at her side, 
with downcast [[eyes]], appears the fatal bride. 
they mount the cliff, where pallas' temple stands; 
pray'rs in their mouths, and presents [[present]] in their hands, 
with censers first they fume the [[sacred]] shrine, 
then in this [[common]] supplication join: 
"o patroness of arms, unspotted maid, 
propitious hear, and lend thy latins aid! 
break short the pirate's lance; pronounce his [[fate]], 
and lay the phrygian low before the gate." 
now turnus arms for [[fight]]. his back and breast 
well-temper'd steel and scaly brass invest: 
the cuishes which his brawny thighs infold 
are mingled metal damask'd o'er with gold. 
his faithful fauchion sits upon his side; 
nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide: 
but, bare to view, amid surrounding [[friends]], 
with godlike grace, he from the tow'r descends. 
exulting in his [[strength]], he seems to dare 
his absent rival, and to promise [[war]]. 
freed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins, 
the wanton courser prances o'er the plains, 
or in the [[pride]] of [[youth]] o'erleaps the mounds, 
and snuffs the females in forbidden grounds. 
or seeks his wat'ring in the well-known flood, 
to quench his thirst, and cool his fiery [[blood]]: 
he swims luxuriant in the liquid plain, 
and o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane: 
he neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high; 
before his ample chest the frothy waters fly. 
soon as the [[prince]] appears without the gate, 
the volscians, with their virgin leader, wait 
his [[last]] commands. then, with a graceful mien, 
lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen: 
her squadron imitates, and each descends; 
whose [[common]] suit camilla thus commends: 
"if sense of [[honor]], if a [[soul]] secure 
of inborn worth, that can all tests endure, 
can promise aught, or on itself rely 
greatly to dare, to conquer or to [[die]]; 
then, i alone, sustain'd by these, will meet 
the tyrrhene [[troops]], and promise their defeat. 
ours be the danger, ours the sole renown: 
you, gen'ral, stay behind, and guard the town:" 
turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise, 
and on the fierce virago fix'd his [[eyes]]; 
then thus return'd: "o grace of [[italy]], 
with what becoming thanks can i reply? 
not only words [[lie]] lab'ring in my breast, 
but [[thought]] itself is by thy [[praise]] oppress'd. 
yet rob me not of all; but let me join 
my toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine. 
the trojan, not in stratagem unskill'd, 
sends his [[light]] horse before to scour the field: 
himself, thro' steep ascents and thorny brakes, 
a larger compass to the [[city]] takes. 
this news my scouts confirm, and i prepare 
to foil his cunning, and his [[force]] to dare; 
with chosen foot his passage to forelay, 
and place an ambush in the winding way. 
thou, with thy volscians, face the tuscan horse; 
the brave messapus shall thy [[troops]] inforce 
with those of tibur, and the latian band, 
subjected all to thy supreme command." 
this said, he warns messapus to the [[war]], 
then ev'ry [[chief]] exhorts with [[equal]] [[care]]. 
all thus encourag'd, his own [[troops]] he joins, 
and hastes to prosecute his deep designs. 
inclos'd with hills, a winding valley lies [[lie]], 
by [[nature]] form'd for fraud, and fitted for surprise. 
a narrow track, by [[human]] steps untrode, 
leads, thro' perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode. 
high o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands, 
whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands. 
the top is level, an offensive seat 
of [[war]]; and from the [[war]] a safe retreat: 
for, on the [[right]] and left, is room to press 
the foes at hand, or from afar distress; 
to drive 'em headlong downward, and to pour 
on their descending backs a stony show'r. 
thither [[young]] turnus took the well-known way, 
possess'd the pass, and in blind ambush lay. 
meantime latonian phoebe, from the skies [[sky]], 
beheld th' approaching [[war]] with hateful [[eyes]], 
and call'd the light-foot opis to her aid, 
her most belov'd and ever-trusty maid; 
then with a sigh began: "camilla goes 
to meet her [[death]] amidst her fatal foes: 
the nymphs [[nymph]] i lov'd of all my mortal train, 
invested with diana's arms, in [[vain]]. 
nor is my [[kindness]] for the virgin new: 
't was born with her; and with her years it grew. 
her [[father]] metabus, when forc'd away 
from old privernum, for tyrannic sway, 
snatch'd up, and sav'd from his prevailing foes, 
this tender babe, companion of his woes. 
casmilla was her [[mother]]; but he drown'd 
one hissing letter in a softer sound, 
and call'd camilla. thro' the woods he flies; 
wrapp'd in his robe the [[royal]] infant lies [[lie]]. 
his foes in sight, he mends his weary pace; 
with shout and clamors they pursue the chase. 
the banks of amasene at length he gains: 
the raging flood his farther flight restrains, 
rais'd o'er the borders with unusual rains. 
prepar'd to plunge into the stream, he fears [[fear]], 
not for himself, but for the charge he bears. 
anxious, he stops a while, and thinks [[think]] in haste; 
then, desp'rate in distress, resolves at [[last]]. 
a knotty lance of well-boil'd oak he bore; 
the middle part with cork he cover'd o'er: 
he clos'd the child within the hollow space; 
with twigs of bending osier bound the case; 
then pois'd the spear, heavy with [[human]] weight, 
and thus invok'd my favor for the freight: 
'accept, [[great]] [[goddess]] of the woods,' he said, 
'sent by her sire, this dedicated maid! 
thro' air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine; 
and the first [[weapons]] that she knows [[know]], are thine.' 
he said; and with full [[force]] the spear he threw: 
above the sounding waves camilla flew. 
then, press'd by foes, he stemm'd the stormy tide, 
and gain'd, by stress of arms, the farther side. 
his fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground, 
and, victor of his vows, his infant [[nymph]] unbound; 
nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose, 
would trust his hunted [[life]] amidst his foes; 
but, rough, in open air he chose to [[lie]]; 
earth was his couch, his cov'ring was the [[sky]]. 
on hills unshorn, or in a desart den, 
he shunn'd the dire [[society]] of [[men]]. 
a shepherd's solitary [[life]] he [[led]]; 
his [[daughter]] with the milk of mares he fed. 
the dugs of bears, and ev'ry salvage beast, 
he drew, and thro' her lips the liquor press'd. 
the little amazon could scarcely go: 
he loads her with a quiver and a bow; 
and, that she might her stagg'ring steps command, 
he with a slender jav'lin fills her hand. 
her flowing hair no golden fillet bound; 
nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground. 
instead of these, a tiger's hide o'erspread 
her back and shoulders, fasten'd to her head. 
the flying dart she first attempts to fling, 
and round her tender temples toss'd the sling; 
then, as her [[strength]] with years increas'd, began 
to pierce aloft in air the soaring swan, 
and from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane. 
the tuscan matrons with each other vied, 
to bless their rival sons [[son]] with such a bride; 
but she disdains their [[love]], to share with me 
the sylvan shades and vow'd virginity. 
and, o! i [[wish]], contented with my cares [[care]] 
of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars! 
then had she been of my celestial train, 
and shunn'd the [[fate]] that dooms her to be slain. 
but since, opposing heav'n's decree, she goes 
to find her [[death]] among forbidden foes, 
haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight. 
where, with the gods, averse, the latins [[fight]]. 
this bow to thee, this quiver i bequeath, 
this chosen arrow, to [[revenge]] her [[death]]: 
by whate'er hand camilla shall be slain, 
or of the trojan or italian train, 
let him not pass unpunish'd from the plain. 
then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid 
to bear the breathless [[body]] of my maid: 
unspoil'd shall be her arms, and unprofan'd 
her holy limbs with any [[human]] hand, 
and in a marble tomb laid in her native [[land]]." 
she said. the faithful [[nymph]] descends from high 
with rapid flight, and cuts the sounding [[sky]]: 
black clouds and stormy winds around her [[body]] fly. 
by this, the trojan and the tuscan horse, 
drawn up in squadrons, with [[united]] [[force]], 
approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound, 
press forward on their bits, and shift their ground. 
shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far; 
and the fields glitter with a waving [[war]]. 
oppos'd to these, come on with furious [[force]] 
messapus, coras, and the latian horse; 
these in the [[body]] plac'd, on either hand 
sustain'd and clos'd by [[fair]] camilla's band. 
advancing in a line, they couch their spears; 
and less and less the middle space appears. 
thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen 
the neighing coursers, and the shouting [[men]]. 
in distance of their darts they stop their course; 
then [[man]] to [[man]] they rush, and horse to horse. 
the face of heav'n their flying jav'lins hide, 
and deaths [[death]] unseen are dealt on either side. 
tyrrhenus, and aconteus, void of [[fear]], 
by mettled coursers borne in full [[career]], 
meet first oppos'd; and, with a mighty shock, 
their horses' heads against each other knock. 
far from his steed is fierce aconteus cast, 
as with an engine's [[force]], or lightning's blast: 
he rolls along in [[blood]], and breathes his [[last]]. 
the latin squadrons take a sudden fright, 
and sling their shields behind, to save their backs in flight

spurring at speed to their own walls they drew; 
close in the rear the tuscan [[troops]] pursue, 
and urge their flight: asylas leads the chase; 
till, seiz'd, with shame, they wheel about and face, 
receive their foes, and raise a threat'ning cry. 
the tuscans take their turn to [[fear]] and fly. 
so swelling surges, with a thund'ring roar, 
driv'n on each other's backs, insult the shore, 
bound o'er the rocks, incroach upon the [[land]], 
and far upon the beach eject the sand; 
then backward, with a swing, they take their way, 
repuls'd from upper ground, and seek their [[mother]] sea; 
with [[equal]] hurry quit th' invaded shore, 
and swallow back the sand and stones they spew'd before.

twice were the tuscans masters of the field, 
twice by the latins, in their turn, repell'd. 
asham'd at length, to the third charge they ran; 
both hosts resolv'd, and mingled [[man]] to [[man]]. 
now dying groans are heard; the fields are strow'd 
with falling bodies [[body]], and are drunk with [[blood]]. 
arms, horses, [[men]], on heaps together [[lie]]: 
confus'd the [[fight]], and more confus'd the cry. 
orsilochus, who durst not press too near 
strong remulus, at distance drove his spear, 
and stuck the steel beneath his horse's ear. 
the fiery steed, impatient of the wound, 
curvets, and, springing upward with a bound, 
his helpless [[lord]] cast backward on the ground. 
catillus pierc'd iolas first; then drew 
his reeking lance, and at herminius threw, 
the mighty champion of the tuscan crew. 
his neck and throat unarm'd, his head was bare, 
but shaded with a length of yellow hair: 
secure, he fought, expos'd on ev'ry part, 
a spacious mark for swords [[sword]], and for the flying dart. 
across the shoulders came the feather'd wound; 
transfix'd he fell, and doubled to the ground. 
the sands with streaming [[blood]] are sanguine dyed, 
and [[death]] with [[honor]] sought on either side. 
resistless thro' the [[war]] camilla rode, 
in danger unappall'd, and pleas'd with [[blood]]. 
one side was bare for her exerted breast; 
one shoulder with her painted quiver press'd. 
now from afar her fatal jav'lins play; 
now with her ax's edge she hews her way: 
diana's arms upon her shoulder sound; 
and when, too closely press'd, she quits the ground, 
from her bent bow she sends a backward wound. 
her maids, in martial pomp, on either side, 
larina, tulla, fierce tarpeia, ride: 
italians all; in [[peace]], their queen's delight; 
in [[war]], the bold companions of the [[fight]]. 
so march'd the tracian amazons of old, 
when thermodon with bloody billows roll'd: 
such [[troops]] as these in shining arms were seen, 
when theseus met in [[fight]] their maiden queen: 
such to the field penthisilea [[led]], 
from the fierce virgin when the grecians fled; 
with such, return'd triumphant from the [[war]], 
her maids with cries attend the lofty car; 
they clash with manly [[force]] their moony shields; 
with female shouts resound the phrygian fields. 
who foremost, and who [[last]], heroic maid, 
on the cold [[earth]] were by thy [[courage]] laid? 
thy spear, of mountain ash, eumenius first, 
with fury driv'n, from side to side transpierc'd: 
a purple stream came spouting from the wound; 
bath'd in his [[blood]] he lies [[lie]], and bites the ground. 
liris and pegasus at once she slew: 
the former, as the slacken'd reins he drew 
of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch'd 
his arm to prop his friend, the jav'lin reach'd. 
by the same weapon, sent from the same hand, 
both fall together, and both spurn the sand. 
amastrus next is added to the slain: 
the rest in rout she follows o'er the plain: 
tereus, harpalycus, demophoon, 
and chromis, at full speed her fury shun. 
of all her deadly darts, not one she lost; 
each was attended with a trojan ghost. 
young ornithus bestrode a hunter steed, 
swift for the chase, and of apulian breed. 
him from afar she spied, in arms unknown: 
o'er his broad back an ox's hide was thrown; 
his helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread 
a cov'ring for his cheeks, and grinn'd around his head, 
he clench'd within his hand an iron prong, 
and tower'd above the rest, conspicuous in the throng. 
him soon she singled from the flying train, 
and slew with ease; then thus insults the slain: 
"vain hunter, didst thou [[think]] thro' woods to chase 
the savage herd, a vile and trembling [[race]]? 
here cease thy vaunts, and own my [[victory]]: 
a woman warrior was too [[strong]] for thee. 
yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu'ror's name, 
confessing [[great]] camilla, save thy shame." 
then butes and orsilochus she slew, 
the bulkiest bodies [[body]] of the trojan crew; 
but butes breast to breast: the spear descends 
above the gorget, where his helmet ends, 
and o'er the shield which his left side defends. 
orsilochus and she their courses ply: 
he seems to [[follow]], and she seems to fly; 
but in a narrower ring she makes the [[race]]; 
and then he flies, and she pursues the chase. 
gath'ring at length on her deluded foe, 
she swings her ax, and rises to the blow 
full on the helm behind, with such a sway 
the weapon falls, the riven steel gives way: 
he groans, he roars, he sues in [[vain]] for grace; 
brains, mingled with his [[blood]], besmear his face. 
astonish'd aunus just arrives by [[chance]], 
to see his fall; nor farther dares advance; 
but, fixing on the horrid maid his eye, 
he stares, and shakes, and finds it [[vain]] to fly; 
yet, like a true ligurian, born to [[cheat]], 
(at least while [[fortune]] favor'd his deceit,) 
cries out aloud: "what [[courage]] have you shown, 
who trust your courser's [[strength]], and not your own? 
forego the vantage of your horse, alight, 
and then on [[equal]] terms begin the [[fight]]: 
it shall be seen, [[weak]] woman, what you can, 
when, foot to foot, you combat with a [[man]]," 
he said. she glows with anger and disdain, 
dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain, 
and leaves her horse at large among her train; 
with her drawn [[sword]] defies him to the field, 
and, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield. 
the [[youth]], who [[thought]] his cunning did succeed, 
reins round his horse, and urges all his speed; 
adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides 
the goring rowels in his bleeding sides. 
"vain [[fool]], and coward!" cries the lofty maid, 
"caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid! 
on others practice thy ligurian [[arts]]; 
thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts [[heart]] 
are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire, 
with vaunting lies [[lie]], to thy fallacious sire." 
at this, so fast her flying feet she sped, 
that soon she strain'd beyond his horse's head: 
then turning short, at once she seiz'd the rein, 
and laid the boaster grov'ling on the plain. 
not with more ease the falcon, from above, 
trusses in middle air the trembling dove, 
then plumes the prey, in her [[strong]] pounces bound: 
the feathers, foul with [[blood]], come tumbling to the ground.

now mighty jove, from his superior height, 
with his broad eye surveys th' unequal [[fight]]. 
he fires [[fire]] the breast of tarchon with disdain, 
and sends him to redeem th' abandon'd plain. 
betwixt the broken ranks the tuscan rides, 
and these encourages, and those he chides; 
recalls each leader, by his name, from flight; 
renews their ardor, and restores the [[fight]]. 
"what panic [[fear]] has seiz'd your souls [[soul]]? o shame, 
o brand perpetual of th' etrurian name! 
cowards incurable, a woman's hand 
drives, breaks, and scatters your ignoble band! 
now cast away the [[sword]], and quit the shield! 
what use of [[weapons]] which you dare not wield? 
not thus you fly your female foes by night, 
nor shun the feast, when the full bowls invite; 
when to fat off'rings the glad augur calls, 
and the shrill hornpipe sounds to bacchanals. 
these are your [[studied]] cares [[care]], your lewd delight: 
swift to debauch, but slow to manly [[fight]]." 
thus having said, he spurs amid the foes, 
not managing the [[life]] he meant to lose. 
the first he found he seiz'd with headlong haste, 
in his [[strong]] gripe, and clasp'd around the waist; 
't was venulus, whom from his horse he tore, 
and, laid athwart his own, in triumph bore. 
loud shouts ensue; the latins turn their [[eyes]], 
and view th' unusual sight with vast surprise. 
the fiery tarchon, flying o'er the plains, 
press'd in his arms the pond'rous prey sustains; 
then, with his shorten'd spear, explores around 
his jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound. 
nor less the captive struggles for his [[life]]: 
he writhes his [[body]] to prolong the strife, 
and, fencing for his naked throat, exerts 
his utmost vigor, and the point averts. 
so stoops the yellow eagle from on high, 
and bears a speckled serpent thro' the [[sky]], 
fast'ning his crooked talons on the prey: 
the pris'ner hisses thro' the liquid way; 
resists the [[royal]] hawk; and, tho' oppress'd, 
she fights in volumes, and erects her crest: 
turn'd to her foe, she stiffens ev'ry scale, 
and shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threat'ning tail.

against the victor, all defense is [[weak]]: 
th' imperial bird still plies her with his beak; 
he tears her bowels, and her breast he gores; 
then claps his pinions, and securely soars. 
thus, thro' the midst of circling enemies [[enemy]], 
strong tarchon snatch'd and bore away his prize. 
the tyrrhene [[troops]], that shrunk before, now press 
the latins, and presume the like [[success]]. 
then aruns, doom'd to [[death]], his [[arts]] assay'd, 
to murther, unespied, the volscian maid: 
this way and that his winding course he bends, 
and, whereso'er she turns, her steps attends. 
when she retires victorious from the chase, 
he wheels about with [[care]], and shifts his place; 
when, rushing on, she seeks her foes flight, 
he keeps aloof, but keeps her still in sight: 
he threats, and trembles, trying ev'ry way, 
unseen to kill, and safely to betray. 
chloreus, the [[priest]] of cybele, from far, 
glitt'ring in phrygian arms amidst the [[war]], 
was by the virgin view'd. the steed he press'd 
was proud with trappings, and his brawny chest 
with scales of gilded brass was cover'd o'er; 
a robe of tyrian dye the rider wore. 
with deadly wounds he gall'd the distant foe; 
gnossian his shafts, and lycian was his bow: 
a golden helm his front and head surrounds 
a gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds. 
gold, weav'd with linen, on his thighs he wore, 
with flowers of needlework distinguish'd o'er, 
with golden buckles bound, and gather'd up before. 
him the fierce maid beheld with ardent [[eyes]], 
fond and ambitious of so [[rich]] a prize, 
or that the temple might his trophies hold, 
or else to shine herself in trojan gold. 
blind in her haste, she chases him alone. 
and seeks his [[life]], regardless of her own. 
this lucky moment the sly traitor chose: 
then, starting from his ambush, up he rose, 
and threw, but first to heav'n address'd his vows: 
"o patron of socrates' high abodes, 
phoebus, the ruling pow'r among the gods, 
whom first we serve, whole woods of unctuous pine 
are fell'd for thee, and to thy [[glory]] shine; 
by thee protected with our naked soles, 
thro' flames unsing'd we march, and tread the kindled coals

give me, propitious pow'r, to wash away 
the stains of this dishonorable day: 
nor spoils, nor triumph, from the [[fact]] i claim, 
but with my future actions trust my fame. 
let me, by stealth, this female plague o'ercome, 
and from the field return inglorious [[home]]." 
apollo heard, and, granting half his pray'r, 
shuffled in winds the rest, and toss'd in empty air. 
he gives the [[death]] desir'd; his safe return 
by southern tempests to the seas is borne. 
now, when the jav'lin whizz'd along the skies [[sky]], 
both armies [[army]] on camilla turn'd their [[eyes]], 
directed by the sound. of either host, 
th' unhappy virgin, tho' concern'd the most, 
was only deaf; so greedy was she bent 
on golden spoils, and on her prey intent; 
till in her pap the winged weapon stood 
infix'd, and deeply drunk the purple [[blood]]. 
her [[sad]] attendants hasten to sustain 
their dying [[lady]], drooping on the plain. 
far from their sight the trembling aruns flies, 
with beating [[heart]], and [[fear]] confus'd with joys; 
nor dares he farther to pursue his blow, 
or ev'n to bear the sight of his expiring foe. 
as, when the wolf has torn a bullock's hide 
at unawares, or ranch'd a shepherd's side, 
conscious of his audacious deed, he flies, 
and claps his quiv'ring tail between his thighs: 
so, speeding once, the wretch no more attends, 
but, spurring forward, herds among his [[friends]]. 
she wrench'd the jav'lin with her dying hands, 
but wedg'd within her breast the weapon stands; 
the wood she draws, the steely point remains; 
she staggers in her seat with agonizing pains [[pain]]: 
(a gath'ring mist o'erclouds her cheerful [[eyes]], 
and from her cheeks the rosy color flies:) 
then turns to her, whom of her female train 
she trusted most, and thus she speaks with [[pain]]: 
"acca, 't is past! he swims before my sight, 
inexorable [[death]]; and claims his [[right]]. 
bear my [[last]] words to turnus; fly with speed, 
and bid him timely to my charge succeed, 
repel the trojans, and the town relieve: 
farewell! and in this kiss my parting breath receive." 
she said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain: 
dying, her open'd hand forsakes the rein; 
short, and more short, she pants; by slow degrees [[degree]] 
her [[mind]] the passage from her [[body]] frees. 
she drops her [[sword]]; she nods her plumy crest, 
her drooping head declining on her breast: 
in the [[last]] sigh her struggling [[soul]] expires, 
and, murm'ring with disdain, to stygian sounds retires. 
a shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued; 
despair and rage the languish'd [[fight]] renew'd. 
the trojan [[troops]] and tuscans, in a line, 
advance to charge; the mix'd arcadians join. 
but cynthia's maid, high seated, from afar 
surveys the field, and [[fortune]] of the [[war]], 
unmov'd a while, till, prostrate on the plain, 
welt'ring in [[blood]], she sees camilla slain, 
and, round her corpse, of [[friends]] and foes a fighting train.

then, from the bottom of her breast, she drew 
a mournful sigh, and these [[sad]] words ensue: 
"too dear a fine, ah much lamented maid, 
for warring with the trojans, thou hast paid! 
nor aught avail'd, in this unhappy strife, 
diana's [[sacred]] arms, to save thy [[life]]. 
yet unreveng'd thy [[goddess]] will not leave 
her vot'ry's [[death]], nor; with [[vain]] [[sorrow]] grieve. 
branded the wretch, and be his name abhorr'd; 
but after ages [[age]] shall thy [[praise]] record. 
th' inglorious [[coward]] soon shall press the plain: 
thus vows thy queen, and thus the fates [[fate]] ordain." 
high o'er the field there stood a hilly mound, 
sacred the place, and spread with oaks around, 
where, in a marble tomb, dercennus lay, 
a [[king]] that once in latium bore the sway. 
the beauteous opis thither bent her flight, 
to mark the traitor aruns from the height. 
him in refulgent arms she soon espied, 
swoln with [[success]]; and loudly thus she cried: 
"thy backward steps, [[vain]] boaster, are too late; 
turn like a [[man]], at length, and meet thy [[fate]]. 
charg'd with my message, to camilla go, 
and say i sent thee to the shades below, 
an [[honor]] undeserv'd from cynthia's bow." 
she said, and from her quiver chose with speed 
the winged shaft, predestin'd for the deed; 
then to the stubborn yew her [[strength]] applied, 
till the far distant horns approach'd on either side. 
the bowstring touch'd her breast, so [[strong]] she drew; 
whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew. 
at once the twanging bow and sounding dart 
the traitor heard, and [[felt]] the point within his [[heart]]. 
him, beating with his heels in pangs of [[death]], 
his flying [[friends]] to [[foreign]] fields bequeath. 
the conqu'ring damsel, with expanded wings, 
the welcome message to her mistress brings. 
their leader lost, the volscians quit the field, 
and, unsustain'd, the chiefs [[chief]] of turnus yield. 
the frighted soldiers, when their captains fly, 
more on their speed than on their [[strength]] rely. 
confus'd in flight, they bear each other down, 
and spur their horses headlong to the town. 
driv'n by their foes, and to their fears [[fear]] resign'd, 
not once they turn, but take their wounds behind. 
these drop the shield, and those the lance forego, 
or on their shoulders bear the slacken'd bow. 
the hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound, 
beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground. 
black clouds of dust come rolling in the [[sky]], 
and o'er the darken'd walls and rampires fly. 
the trembling matrons, from their lofty stands, 
rend heav'n with female shrieks, and wring their hands. 
all pressing on, pursuers and pursued, 
are crush'd in crowds, a mingled multitude. 
some [[happy]] few escape: the throng too late 
rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate. 
ev'n in the sight of [[home]], the wretched sire 
looks on, and sees his helpless [[son]] expire. 
then, in a fright, the folding gates they close, 
but leave their [[friends]] excluded with their foes. 
the vanquish'd cry; the victors loudly shout; 
't is terror all within, and slaughter all without. 
blind in their [[fear]], they bounce against the wall, 
or, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall. 
the latian virgins, valiant with despair, 
arm'd on the tow'rs, the [[common]] danger share: 
so much of zeal their country's cause inspir'd; 
so much camilla's [[great]] [[example]] fir'd. 
poles, sharpen'd in the flames, from high they throw, 
with imitated darts, to gall the foe. 
their lives [[life]] for godlike [[freedom]] they bequeath, 
and crowd each other to be first in [[death]]. 
meantime to turnus, ambush'd in the shade, 
with heavy tidings came th' unhappy maid: 
"the volscians overthrown, camilla kill'd; 
the foes, entirely masters of the field, 
like a resistless flood, come rolling on: 
the cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town." 
inflam'd with rage, (for so the furies [[fire]] 
the daunian's breast, and so the fates [[fate]] require,) 
he leaves the hilly pass, the woods in [[vain]] 
possess'd, and downward issues on the plain. 
scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed 
from secret foes, the trojan [[troops]] succeed. 
thro' the black forest and the ferny brake, 
unknowingly secure, their way they take; 
from the rough mountains to the plain descend, 
and there, in order drawn, their line extend. 
both armies [[army]] now in open fields are seen; 
nor far the distance of the space between. 
both to the [[city]] bend. [[aeneas]] sees, 
thro' smoking fields, his hast'ning enemies [[enemy]]; 
and turnus views the trojans in array, 
and hears th' approaching horses proudly neigh. 
soon had their hosts in bloody [[battle]] join'd; 
but westward to the sea the sun declin'd. 
intrench'd before the town both armies [[army]] [[lie]], 
while night with sable wings involves the [[sky]]. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

book xii

when turnus saw the latins leave the field, 
their armies [[army]] broken, and their [[courage]] quell'd, 
himself become the mark of [[public]] spite, 
his [[honor]] question'd for the promis'd [[fight]]; 
the more he was with vulgar hate oppress'd, 
the more his fury boil'd within his breast: 
he rous'd his vigor for the [[last]] debate, 
and rais'd his haughty [[soul]] to meet his [[fate]]. 
as, when the swains the libyan lion chase, 
he makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; 
but, if the pointed jav'lin pierce his side, 
the lordly beast returns with double [[pride]]: 
he wrenches out the steel, he roars for [[pain]]; 
his sides he lashes, and erects his mane: 
so turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with [[fire]], 
thro' his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. 
trembling with rage, around the court he ran, 
at length approach'd the [[king]], and thus began: 
"no more excuses or delays: i stand 
in arms prepar'd to combat, hand to hand, 
this base deserter of his native [[land]]. 
the trojan, by his word, is bound to take 
the same conditions which himself did make. 
renew the truce; the solemn rites prepare, 
and to my [[single]] [[virtue]] trust the [[war]]. 
the latians unconcern'd shall see the [[fight]]; 
this arm unaided shall assert your [[right]]: 
then, if my prostrate [[body]] press the plain, 
to him the [[crown]] and beauteous bride remain." 
to whom the [[king]] sedately thus replied: 
"brave [[youth]], the more your valor has been tried, 
the more becomes it us, with due [[respect]], 
to weigh the [[chance]] of [[war]], which you neglect. 
you want not [[wealth]], or a successive [[throne]], 
or cities [[city]] which your arms have made your own: 
my towns and treasures are at your command, 
and stor'd with blooming beauties [[beauty]] is my [[land]]; 
laurentum more than one lavinia sees, 
unmarried, [[fair]], of [[noble]] families [[family]]. 
now let me speak, and you with patience hear, 
things which perhaps may grate a lover's ear, 
but sound [[advice]], proceeding from a [[heart]] 
sincerely yours, and [[free]] from fraudful art [[arts]]. 
the gods, by signs, have manifestly shown, 
no [[prince]] italian born should heir my [[throne]]: 
oft have our augurs, in prediction skill'd, 
and oft our priests [[priest]], [[foreign]] [[son]] reveal'd. 
yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood, 
brib'd by my [[kindness]] to my kindred [[blood]], 
urg'd by my [[wife]], who would not be denied, 
i promis'd my lavinia for your bride: 
her from her plighted [[lord]] by [[force]] i took; 
all ties of treaties, and of [[honor]], broke: 
on your account i wag'd an impious war- 
with what [[success]], 't is needless to declare; 
i and my subjects [[subject]] [[feel]], and you have had your share. 
twice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive, 
scarce in our walls we keep our hopes [[hope]] alive: 
the rolling flood runs warm with [[human]] gore; 
the bones of latians blanch the neighb'ring shore. 
why put i not an end to this debate, 
still unresolv'd, and still a [[slave]] to [[fate]]? 
if turnus' [[death]] a lasting [[peace]] can give, 
why should i not procure it whilst you [[live]]? 
should i to doubtful arms your [[youth]] betray, 
what would my kinsmen the rutulians say? 
and, should you fall in [[fight]], (which heav'n defend!) 
how curse the cause which hasten'd to his end 
the daughter's lover and the father's friend? 
weigh in your [[mind]] the various [[chance]] of [[war]]; 
pity your parent's [[age]], and ease his [[care]]." 
such balmy words he pour'd, but all in [[vain]]: 
the proffer'd med'cine but provok'd the [[pain]]. 
the wrathful [[youth]], disdaining the relief, 
with intermitting sobs thus vents his [[grief]]: 
"the [[care]], o [[best]] of fathers [[father]], which you take 
for my concerns, at my [[desire]] forsake. 
permit me not to languish out my days, 
but make the [[best]] exchange of [[life]] for [[praise]]. 
this arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize; 
and the [[blood]] follows, where the weapon flies. 
his [[goddess]] [[mother]] is not near, to shroud 
the flying [[coward]] with an empty cloud." 
but now the queen, who fear'd for turnus' [[life]], 
and loath'd the hard conditions of the strife, 
held him by [[force]]; and, dying in his [[death]], 
in these [[sad]] accents gave her [[sorrow]] breath: 
"o turnus, i adjure thee by these tears, 
and whate'er price amata's [[honor]] bears 
within thy breast, since thou art [[arts]] all my [[hope]], 
my sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop; 
since on the safety of thy [[life]] alone 
depends latinus, and the latian [[throne]]: 
refuse me not this one, this only pray'r, 
to waive the combat, and pursue the [[war]]. 
whatever [[chance]] attends this fatal strife, 
think it includes, in thine, amata's [[life]]. 
i cannot [[live]] a [[slave]], or see my [[throne]] 
usurp'd by strangers or a trojan [[son]]." 
at this, a flood of tears lavinia shed; 
a crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread, 
varying her cheeks by turns with [[white]] and red. 
the driving colors, never at a stay, 
run here and there, and flush, and fade away. 
delightful change! thus [[indian]] iv'ry shows, 
which with the bord'ring paint of purple glows; 
or lilies damask'd by the neighb'ring rose. 
the lover gaz'd, and, burning with [[desire]], 
the more he look'd, the more he fed the [[fire]]: 
revenge, and [[jealous]] rage, and secret spite, 
roll in his breast, and rouse him to the [[fight]]. 
then fixing on the queen his ardent [[eyes]], 
firm to his first intent, he thus replies: 
"o [[mother]], do not by your tears prepare 
such boding omens, and prejudge the [[war]]. 
resolv'd on [[fight]], i am no longer [[free]] 
to shun my [[death]], if heav'n my [[death]] decree." 
then turning to the herald, thus pursues: 
"go, greet the trojan with ungrateful news; 
denounce from me, that, when to-morrow's [[light]] 
shall gild the heav'ns, he need not urge the [[fight]]; 
the trojan and rutulian [[troops]] no more 
shall dye, with mutual [[blood]], the latian shore: 
our [[single]] swords [[sword]] the quarrel shall decide, 
and to the victor be the beauteous bride." 
he said, and striding on, with speedy pace, 
he sought his coursers of the thracian [[race]]. 
at his approach they toss their heads on high, 
and, proudly neighing, promise [[victory]]. 
the sires of these orythia sent from far, 
to grace pilumnus, when he went to [[war]]. 
the drifts of thracian snows were scarce so [[white]], 
nor northern winds in fleetness match'd their flight. 
officious grooms stand ready by his side; 
and some with combs their flowing manes divide, 
and others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride

he sheath'd his limbs in arms; a temper'd mass 
of golden metal those, and mountain brass. 
then to his head his glitt'ring helm he tied, 
and girt his faithful fauchion to his side. 
in his aetnaean forge, the [[god]] of [[fire]] 
that fauchion labor'd for the hero's sire; 
immortal keenness on the blade bestow'd, 
and plung'd it hissing in the stygian flood. 
propp'd on a pillar, which the ceiling bore, 
was plac'd the lance auruncan actor wore; 
which with such [[force]] he brandish'd in his hand, 
the tough ash trembled like an osier wand: 
then cried: "o pond'rous spoil of actor slain, 
and never yet by turnus toss'd in [[vain]], 
fail not this day thy wonted [[force]]; but go, 
sent by this hand, to pierce the trojan foe! 
give me to tear his corslet from his breast, 
and from that eunuch head to rend the crest; 
dragg'd in the dust, his frizzled hair to soil, 
hot from the vexing ir'n, and smear'd with fragrant oil!"

thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies 
a fiery steam, and sparkles from his [[eyes]]. 
so fares the bull in his lov'd female's sight: 
proudly he bellows, and preludes the [[fight]]; 
he tries his goring horns against a tree, 
and meditates his absent [[enemy]]; 
he pushes at the winds; he digs the strand 
with his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand. 
nor less the trojan, in his lemnian arms, 
to future [[fight]] his manly [[courage]] warms: 
he whets his fury, and with joy prepares 
to terminate at once the ling'ring wars [[war]]; 
to cheer his chiefs [[chief]] and tender [[son]], relates 
what heav'n had promis'd, and expounds the fates [[fate]]. 
then to the latian [[king]] he sends, to cease 
the rage of arms, and ratify the [[peace]]. 
the morn ensuing, from the mountain's height, 
had scarcely spread the skies [[sky]] with rosy [[light]]; 
th' ethereal coursers, bounding from the sea, 
from out their flaming nostrils breath'd the day; 
when now the trojan and rutulian guard, 
in friendly labor join'd, the list prepar'd. 
beneath the walls they measure out the space; 
then [[sacred]] altars rear, on sods of grass, 
where, with [[religious]] their [[common]] gods they place. 
in purest [[white]] the priests [[priest]] their heads attire; 
and living waters bear, and holy [[fire]]; 
and, o'er their linen hoods and shaded hair, 
long twisted wreaths of [[sacred]] veryain wear, 
in order issuing from the town appears 
the latin legion, arm'd with pointed spears; 
and from the fields, advancing on a line, 
the trojan and the tuscan forces [[force]] join: 
their various arms afford a pleasing sight; 
a peaceful train they seem, in [[peace]] prepar'd for [[fight]].

betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride, 
glitt'ring with gold, and vests in purple dyed; 
here mnestheus, author of the memmian line, 
and there messapus, born of seed [[divine]]. 
the sign is giv'n; and, round the listed space, 
each [[man]] in order fills his proper place. 
reclining on their ample shields, they stand, 
and fix their pointed lances in the sand. 
now, studious of the sight, a num'rous throng 
of either [[sex]] promiscuous, old and [[young]], 
swarm the town: by those who rest behind, 
the gates and walls and houses' tops are lin'd. 
meantime the queen of heav'n beheld the sight, 
with [[eyes]] unpleas'd, from mount albano's height 
(since call'd albano by succeeding fame, 
but then an empty hill, without a name). 
she thence survey'd the field, the trojan pow'rs, 
the latian squadrons, and laurentine tow'rs. 
then thus the [[goddess]] of the skies [[sky]] bespoke, 
with sighs and tears, the [[goddess]] of the lake, 
king turnus' sister, once a lovely maid, 
ere to the [[lust]] of lawless jove betray'd: 
compress'd by [[force]], but, by the grateful [[god]], 
now made the nais of the neighb'ring flood. 
"o [[nymph]], the [[pride]] of living lakes," said she, 
"o most renown'd, and most belov'd by me, 
long hast thou known, nor need i to record, 
the wanton sallies of my wand'ring [[lord]]. 
of ev'ry latian [[fair]] whom jove misled 
to mount by stealth my violated bed, 
to thee alone i grudg'd not his embrace, 
but gave a part of heav'n, and an unenvied place. 
now learn from me thy near approaching [[grief]], 
nor [[think]] my wishes [[wish]] want to thy relief. 
while [[fortune]] favor'd, nor heav'n's [[king]] denied 
to lend my succor to the latian side, 
i sav'd thy [[brother]], and the sinking [[state]]: 
but now he struggles with unequal [[fate]], 
and goes, with gods averse, o'ermatch'd in might, 
to meet inevitable [[death]] in [[fight]]; 
nor must i break the truce, nor can sustain the sight. 
thou, if thou dar'st thy [[present]] aid supply; 
it well becomes a sister's [[care]] to try." 
at this the lovely [[nymph]], with [[grief]] oppress'd, 
thrice tore her hair, and beat her comely breast. 
to whom saturnia thus: "thy tears are late: 
haste, snatch him, if he can be snatch'd from [[fate]]: 
new tumults kindle; violate the truce: 
who knows [[know]] what changeful [[fortune]] may [[produce]]? 
't is not a crime t' attempt what i decree; 
or, if it were, discharge the crime on me." 
she said, and, sailing on the winged wind, 
left the [[sad]] [[nymph]] suspended in her [[mind]]. 
and now pomp the peaceful kings [[king]] appear: 
four steeds the chariot of latinus bear; 
twelve golden beams around his temples play, 
to mark his lineage from the [[god]] of day. 
two snowy coursers turnus' chariot yoke, 
and in his hand two massy spears he shook: 
then issued from the camp, in arms [[divine]], 
aeneas, author of the roman line; 
and by his side ascanius took his place, 
the second [[hope]] of rome's [[immortal]] [[race]]. 
adorn'd in [[white]], a rev'rend [[priest]] appears, 
and off'rings to the flaming altars bears; 
a porket, and a lamb that never suffer'd shears. 
then to the rising sun he turns his [[eyes]], 
and strews the beasts, design'd for [[sacrifice]], 
with salt and meal: with like officious [[care]] 
he marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair. 
betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds; 
with the same gen'rous juice the flame he feeds. 
aeneas then unsheath'd his shining [[sword]], 
and thus with pious pray'rs the gods ador'd: 
"all-seeing sun, and thou, ausonian soil, 
for which i have sustain'd so long a toil, 
thou, [[king]] of heav'n, and thou, the queen of air, 
propitious now, and reconcil'd by pray'r; 
thou, [[god]] of [[war]], whose unresisted sway 
the labors and events of arms obey; 
ye living fountains, and ye running floods, 
all pow'rs of ocean, all ethereal gods, 
hear, and bear record: if i fall in field, 
or, recreant in the [[fight]], to turnus yield, 
my trojans shall encrease evander's town; 
ascanius shall renounce th' ausonian [[crown]]: 
all claims, all questions [[question]] of debate, shall cease; 
nor he, nor they, with [[force]] infringe the [[peace]]. 
but, if my juster arms prevail in [[fight]], 
(as sure they shall, if i [[divine]] aright,) 
my trojans shall not o'er th' italians reign: 
both [[equal]], both unconquer'd shall remain, 
join'd in their laws [[law]], their lands [[land]], and their abodes; 
i ask but altars for my weary gods. 
the [[care]] of those [[religious]] rites be mine; 
the [[crown]] to [[king]] latinus i resign: 
his be the sov'reign sway. nor will i share 
his pow'r in [[peace]], or his command in [[war]]. 
for me, my [[friends]] another town shall frame, 
and bless the rising tow'rs with [[fair]] lavinia's name." 
thus he. then, with erected [[eyes]] and hands, 
the latian [[king]] before his altar stands. 
"by the same heav'n," said he, "and [[earth]], and main, 
and all the pow'rs that all the three contain; 
by hell below, and by that upper [[god]] 
whose thunder signs the [[peace]], who seals it with his nod;

so let latona's double offspring hear, 
and double-fronted janus, what i swear: 
i touch the [[sacred]] altars, touch the flames, 
and all those pow'rs attest, and all their names; 
whatever [[chance]] befall on either side, 
no term of [[time]] this union shall divide: 
no [[force]], no [[fortune]], shall my vows unbind, 
or shake the steadfast tenor of my [[mind]]; 
not tho' the circling seas should break their bound, 
o'erflow the shores, or sap the solid ground; 
not tho' the lamps of heav'n their spheres forsake, 
hurl'd down, and hissing in the nether lake: 
ev'n as this [[royal]] scepter" (for he bore 
a scepter in his hand) "shall never more 
shoot out in branches, or renew the birth: 
an orphan now, cut from the [[mother]] [[earth]] 
by the keen ax, dishonor'd of its hair, 
and cas'd in brass, for latian kings [[king]] to bear." 
when thus in [[public]] view the [[peace]] was tied 
with solemn vows, and sworn on either side, 
all dues perform'd which holy rites require; 
the victim beasts are slain before the [[fire]], 
the trembling entrails from their bodies [[body]] torn, 
and to the fatten'd flames in chargers borne. 
already the rutulians deem their [[man]] 
o'ermatch'd in arms, before the [[fight]] began. 
first rising fears [[fear]] are whisper'd thro' the crowd; 
then, gath'ring sound, they murmur more aloud. 
now, side to side, they measure with their [[eyes]] 
the champions' bulk, their sinews, and their size: 
the nearer they approach, the more is known 
th' apparent disadvantage of their own. 
turnus himself appears in [[public]] sight 
conscious of [[fate]], desponding of the [[fight]]. 
slowly he moves, and at his altar stands 
with [[eyes]] dejected, and with trembling hands; 
and, while he mutters undistinguish'd pray'rs, 
a livid deadness in his cheeks appears. 
with anxious [[pleasure]] when juturna view'd 
th' increasing fright of the mad multitude, 
when their short sighs and thick'ning sobs she heard, 
and found their ready minds [[mind]] for [[change]] prepar'd; 
dissembling her [[immortal]] form, she took 
camertus' mien, his habit, and his look; 
a [[chief]] of ancient [[blood]]; in arms well known 
was his [[great]] sire, and he his greater [[son]]. 
his shape assum'd, amid the ranks she ran, 
and humoring their first motions, thus began: 
"for shame, rutulians, can you bear the sight 
of one expos'd for all, in [[single]] [[fight]]? 
can we, before the face of heav'n, confess 
our [[courage]] colder, or our numbers less? 
view all the trojan host, th' arcadian band, 
and tuscan [[army]]; count 'em as they stand: 
undaunted to the [[battle]] if we go, 
scarce ev'ry second [[man]] will share a foe. 
turnus, 't is true, in this unequal strife, 
shall lose, with [[honor]], his devoted [[life]], 
or [[change]] it rather for [[immortal]] fame, 
succeeding to the gods, from whence he came: 
but you, a servile and inglorious band, 
for [[foreign]] lords [[lord]] shall sow your native [[land]], 
those fruitful fields your fighting fathers [[father]] gain'd, 
which have so long their lazy sons [[son]] sustain'd." 
with words like these, she carried her design: 
a rising murmur runs along the line. 
then ev'n the [[city]] [[troops]], and latians, tir'd 
with tedious [[war]], seem with new souls [[soul]] inspir'd: 
their champion's [[fate]] with [[pity]] they lament, 
and of the league, so lately sworn, repent. 
nor fails the [[goddess]] to foment the rage 
with lying wonders, and a false presage; 
but adds a sign, which, [[present]] to their [[eyes]], 
inspires new [[courage]], and a glad surprise. 
for, sudden, in the fiery tracts above, 
appears in pomp th' imperial bird of jove: 
a plump of fowl he spies, that swim the lakes, 
and o'er their heads his sounding pinions shakes; 
then, stooping on the fairest of the train, 
in his [[strong]] talons truss'd a silver swan. 
th' italians wonder at th' unusual sight; 
but, while he lags, and labors in his flight, 
behold, the dastard fowl return anew, 
and with [[united]] [[force]] the foe pursue: 
clam'rous around the [[royal]] hawk they fly, 
and, thick'ning in a cloud, o'ershade the [[sky]]. 
they cuff, they scratch, they cross his airy course; 
nor can th' incumber'd bird sustain their [[force]]; 
but vex'd, not vanquish'd, drops the pond'rous prey, 
and, lighten'd of his burthen, wings his way. 
th' ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight, 
eager of action, and demand the [[fight]]. 
then [[king]] tolumnius, vers'd in augurs' [[arts]], 
cries out, and thus his boasted [[skill]] imparts: 
"at length 't is granted, what i long desir'd! 
this, this is what my frequent vows requir'd. 
ye gods, i take your omen, and obey. 
advance, my [[friends]], and charge! i lead the way. 
these are the [[foreign]] foes, whose impious band, 
like that rapacious bird, infest our [[land]]: 
but soon, like him, they shall be forc'd to sea 
by [[strength]] [[united]], and forego the prey. 
your timely succor to your [[country]] bring, 
haste to the rescue, and redeem your [[king]]." 
he said; and, pressing onward thro' the crew, 
pois'd in his lifted arm, his lance he threw. 
the winged weapon, whistling in the wind, 
came driving on, nor miss'd the mark design'd. 
at once the cornel rattled in the skies [[sky]]; 
at once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise. 
nine brothers [[brother]] in a goodly band there stood, 
born of arcadian mix'd with tuscan [[blood]], 
gylippus' sons [[son]]: the fatal jav'lin flew, 
aim'd at the midmost of the friendly crew. 
a passage thro' the jointed arms it found, 
just where the belt was to the [[body]] bound, 
and struck the gentle [[youth]] extended on the ground. 
then, fir'd with pious rage, the gen'rous train 
run madly forward to [[revenge]] the slain. 
and some with eager haste their jav'lins throw; 
and some with [[sword]] in hand assault the foe. 
the wish'd insult the latine [[troops]] embrace, 
and meet their ardor in the middle space. 
the trojans, tuscans, and arcadian line, 
with [[equal]] [[courage]] obviate their design. 
peace leaves the violated fields, and hate 
both armies [[army]] urges to their mutual [[fate]]. 
with impious haste their altars are o'erturn'd, 
the [[sacrifice]] half-broil'd, and half-unburn'd. 
thick storms of steel from either [[army]] fly, 
and clouds of clashing darts obscure the [[sky]]; 
brands from the [[fire]] are missive [[weapons]] made, 
with chargers, bowls, and all the priestly [[trade]]. 
latinus, frighted, hastens from the fray, 
and bears his unregarded gods away. 
these on their horses vault; those yoke the car; 
the rest, with swords [[sword]] on high, run headlong to the [[war]]. 
messapus, eager to confound the [[peace]], 
spurr'd his hot courser thro' the fighting prease, 
at [[king]] aulestes, by his purple known 
a tuscan [[prince]], and by his regal [[crown]]; 
and, with a shock encount'ring, bore him down. 
backward he fell; and, as his [[fate]] design'd, 
the ruins of an altar were behind: 
there, pitching on his shoulders and his head, 
amid the scatt'ring fires [[fire]] he lay supinely spread. 
the beamy spear, descending from above, 
his cuirass pierc'd, and thro' his [[body]] drove. 
then, with a scornful smile, the victor cries: 
"the gods have found a fitter [[sacrifice]]." 
greedy of spoils, th' italians strip the [[dead]] 
of his [[rich]] armor, and uncrown his head. 
priest corynaeus, arm'd his [[better]] hand, 
from his own altar, with a blazing brand; 
and, as ebusus with a thund'ring pace 
advanc'd to [[battle]], dash'd it on his face: 
his bristly beard shines out with sudden fires [[fire]]; 
the crackling crop a noisome scent expires. 
following the blow, he seiz'd his curling [[crown]] 
with his left hand; his other cast him down. 
the prostrate [[body]] with his knees he press'd, 
and plung'd his holy poniard in his breast. 
while podalirius, with his [[sword]], pursued 
the shepherd alsus thro' the flying crowd, 
swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow 
full on the front of his unwary foe. 
the broad ax enters with a crashing sound, 
and cleaves the chin with one continued wound; 
warm [[blood]], and mingled brains, besmear his arms around 
an iron sleep his stupid [[eyes]] oppress'd, 
and seal'd their heavy lids in endless rest. 
but [[good]] [[aeneas]] rush'd amid the bands; 
bare was his head, and naked were his hands, 
in sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud: 
"what sudden rage, what new [[desire]] of [[blood]], 
inflames your alter'd minds [[mind]]? o trojans, cease 
from impious arms, nor violate the peace! 
by [[human]] sanctions, and by laws [[law]] [[divine]], 
the terms are all agreed; the [[war]] is mine. 
dismiss your fears [[fear]], and let the [[fight]] ensue; 
this hand alone shall [[right]] the gods and you: 
our injur'd altars, and their broken vow, 
to this avenging [[sword]] the faithless turnus owe." 
thus while he spoke, unmindful of defense, 
a winged arrow struck the pious [[prince]]. 
but, whether from some [[human]] hand it came, 
or hostile [[god]], is left unknown by fame: 
no [[human]] hand or hostile [[god]] was found, 
to boast the triumph of so base a wound. 
when turnus saw the trojan quit the plain, 
his chiefs [[chief]] dismay'd, his [[troops]] a fainting train, 
th' unhop'd event his heighten'd [[soul]] inspires: 
at once his arms and coursers he requires; 
then, with a leap, his lofty chariot gains, 
and with a ready hand assumes the reins. 
he drives impetuous, and, where'er he goes, 
he leaves behind a lane of slaughter'd foes. 
these his lance reaches; over those he rolls 
his rapid car, and crushes out their souls [[soul]]: 
in [[vain]] the vanquish'd fly; the victor sends 
the [[dead]] men's [[weapons]] at their living [[friends]]. 
thus, on the banks of hebrus' freezing flood, 
the [[god]] of battles [[battle]], in his angry mood, 
clashing his [[sword]] against his brazen shield, 
let loose the reins, and scours along the field: 
before the wind his fiery coursers fly; 
groans the [[sad]] [[earth]], resounds the rattling [[sky]]. 
wrath, terror, [[treason]], tumult, and despair 
(dire faces, and deform'd) surround the car; 
friends of the [[god]], and followers of the [[war]]. 
with fury not unlike, nor less disdain, 
exulting turnus flies along the plain: 
his smoking horses, at their utmost speed, 
he lashes on, and urges o'er the [[dead]]. 
their fetlocks run with [[blood]]; and, when they bound, 
the gore and gath'ring dust are dash'd around. 
thamyris and pholus, masters of the [[war]], 
he kill'd at hand, but sthenelus afar: 
from far the sons [[son]] of imbracus he slew, 
glaucus and lades, of the lycian crew; 
both taught to [[fight]] on foot, in [[battle]] join'd, 
or mount the courser that outstrips the wind. 
meantime eumedes, vaunting in the field, 
new fir'd the trojans, and their foes repell'd. 
this [[son]] of dolon bore his grandsire's name, 
but emulated more his father's fame; 
his guileful [[father]], sent a nightly spy, 
the grecian camp and order to descry: 
hard enterprise! and well he might require 
achilles' car and horses, for his hire: 
but, met upon the scout, th' aetolian [[prince]] 
in [[death]] bestow'd a juster recompense. 
fierce turnus view'd the trojan from afar, 
and launch'd his jav'lin from his lofty car; 
then lightly leaping down, pursued the blow, 
and, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe, 
wrench'd from his feeble hold the shining [[sword]], 
and plung'd it in the bosom of its [[lord]]. 
"possess," said he, "the fruit of all thy pains [[pain]], 
and measure, at thy length, our latian plains. 
thus are my foes rewarded by my hand; 
thus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!"

then dares, butes, sybaris he slew, 
whom o'er his neck his flound'ring courser threw. 
as when loud boreas, with his blust'ring train, 
stoops from above, incumbent on the main; 
where'er he flies, he drives the rack before, 
and rolls the billows on th' aegaean shore: 
so, where resistless turnus takes his course, 
the scatter'd squadrons bend before his [[force]]; 
his crest of horses' hair is blown behind 
by adverse air, and rustles in the wind. 
this haughty phegeus saw with high disdain, 
and, as the chariot roll'd along the plain, 
light from the ground he leapt, and seiz'd the rein. 
thus hung in air, he still retain'd his hold, 
the coursers frighted, and their course controll'd. 
the lance of turnus reach'd him as he hung, 
and pierc'd his plated arms, but pass'd along, 
and only raz'd the skin. he turn'd, and held 
against his threat'ning foe his ample shield; 
then call'd for aid: but, while he cried in [[vain]], 
the chariot bore him backward on the plain. 
he lies [[lie]] revers'd; the victor [[king]] descends, 
and strikes so justly where his helmet ends, 
he lops the head. the latian fields are drunk 
with streams that issue from the bleeding trunk. 
while he triumphs, and while the trojans yield, 
the wounded [[prince]] is forc'd to leave the field: 
strong mnestheus, and achates often tried, 
and [[young]] ascanius, weeping by his side, 
conduct him to his tent. scarce can he rear 
his limbs from [[earth]], supported on his spear. 
resolv'd in [[mind]], regardless of the smart, 
he tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart. 
the steel remains. no readier way he found 
to draw the weapon, than t' inlarge the wound. 
eager of [[fight]], impatient of delay, 
he begs; and his unwilling [[friends]] obey. 
iapis was at hand to prove his art [[arts]], 
whose blooming [[youth]] so fir'd apollo's [[heart]], 
that, for his [[love]], he proffer'd to bestow 
his tuneful harp and his unerring bow. 
the pious [[youth]], more studious how to save 
his aged sire, now sinking to the grave, 
preferr'd the pow'r of plants, and silent [[praise]] 
of healing [[arts]], before phoebean bays. 
propp'd on his lance the pensive hero stood, 
and heard and saw, unmov'd, the mourning crowd. 
the fam'd physician tucks his robes around 
with ready hands, and hastens to the wound. 
with gentle touches he performs his part, 
this way and that, soliciting the dart, 
and exercises all his heav'nly art [[arts]]. 
all soft'ning simples, known of sov'reign use, 
he presses out, and pours their [[noble]] juice. 
these first infus'd, to lenify the [[pain]], 
he tugs with pincers, but he tugs in [[vain]]. 
then to the patron of his art [[arts]] he pray'd: 
the patron of his art [[arts]] refus'd his aid. 
meantime the [[war]] approaches to the tents; 
th' alarm grows hotter, and the noise augments: 
the driving dust proclaims the danger near; 
and first their [[friends]], and then their foes appear: 
their [[friends]] retreat; their foes pursue the rear. 
the camp is fill'd with terror and affright: 
the hissing shafts within the trench alight; 
an undistinguish'd noise ascends the [[sky]], 
the shouts those who kill, and groans of those who [[die]]. 
but now the [[goddess]] [[mother]], mov'd with [[grief]], 
and pierc'd with [[pity]], hastens her relief. 
a branch of healing dittany she brought, 
which in the cretan fields with [[care]] she sought: 
rough is the stern, which woolly leafs surround; 
the leafs with flow'rs, the flow'rs with purple crown'd,

well known to wounded goats; a sure relief 
to draw the pointed steel, and ease the [[grief]]. 
this [[venus]] brings, in clouds involv'd, and brews 
th' extracted liquor with ambrosian dews, 
and odorous panacee. unseen she stands, 
temp'ring the mixture with her heav'nly hands, 
and pours it in a bowl, already crown'd 
with juice of med'c'nal herbs prepar'd to bathe the wound.

the leech, unknowing of superior art [[arts]] 
which aids the cure, with this foments the part; 
and in a moment ceas'd the raging smart. 
stanch'd is the [[blood]], and in the bottom stands: 
the steel, but scarcely touch'd with tender hands, 
moves up, and follows of its own accord, 
and health and vigor are at once restor'd. 
iapis first perceiv'd the closing wound, 
and first the footsteps of a [[god]] he found. 
"arms! arms!" he cries; "the [[sword]] and shield prepare, 
and send the willing [[chief]], renew'd, to [[war]]. 
this is no mortal [[work]], no cure of mine, 
nor art's effect, but done by hands [[divine]]. 
some [[god]] our general to the [[battle]] sends; 
some [[god]] preserves his [[life]] for greater ends." 
the hero arms in haste; his hands infold 
his thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold: 
inflam'd to [[fight]], and rushing to the field, 
that hand sustaining the celestial shield, 
this gripes the lance, and with such vigor shakes, 
that to the rest the beamy weapon quakes. 
then with a close embrace he strain'd his [[son]], 
and, kissing thro' his helmet, thus begun: 
"my [[son]], from my [[example]] learn the [[war]], 
in camps to suffer, and in fields to dare; 
but happier [[chance]] than mine attend thy care! 
this day my hand thy tender [[age]] shall shield, 
and [[crown]] with honors of the conquer'd field: 
thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth 
to toils of [[war]], be mindful of my worth; 
assert thy birthright, and in arms be known, 
for hector's nephew, and aeneas' [[son]]." 
he said; and, striding, issued on the plain. 
anteus and mnestheus, and a num'rous train, 
attend his steps; the rest their [[weapons]] take, 
and, crowding to the field, the camp forsake. 
a cloud of blinding dust is rais'd around, 
labors beneath their feet the trembling ground. 
now turnus, posted on a hill, from far 
beheld the [[progress]] of the moving [[war]]: 
with him the latins view'd the cover'd plains, 
and the chill [[blood]] ran backward in their veins. 
juturna saw th' advancing [[troops]] appear, 
and heard the hostile sound, and fled for [[fear]]. 
aeneas leads; and draws a sweeping train, 
clos'd in their ranks, and pouring on the plain. 
as when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore 
from the mid ocean, drives the waves before; 
the painful hind with heavy [[heart]] foresees 
the flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees; 
with like impetuous rage the [[prince]] appears 
before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears. 
and now both armies [[army]] shock in open field; 
osiris is by [[strong]] thymbraeus kill'd. 
archetius, ufens, epulon, are slain 
(all fam'd in arms, and of the latian train) 
by gyas', mnestheus', and achates' hand. 
the fatal augur falls, by whose command 
the truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued 
with trojan [[blood]], th' unhappy [[fight]] renew'd. 
loud shouts and clamors rend the liquid [[sky]], 
and o'er the field the frighted latins fly. 
the [[prince]] disdains the dastards to pursue, 
nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few; 
turnus alone, amid the dusky plain, 
he seeks, and to the combat calls in [[vain]]. 
juturna heard, and, seiz'd with mortal [[fear]], 
forc'd from the beam her brother's charioteer; 
assumes his shape, his armor, and his mien, 
and, like metiscus, in his seat is seen. 
as the black swallow near the palace plies; 
o'er empty courts, and under arches, flies; 
now hawks aloft, now skims along the flood, 
to furnish her loquacious nest with food: 
so drives the rapid [[goddess]] o'er the plains; 
the smoking horses run with loosen'd reins. 
she steers a various course among the foes; 
now here, now there, her conqu'ring [[brother]] shows; 
now with a straight, now with a wheeling flight, 
she turns, and bends, but shuns the [[single]] [[fight]]. 
aeneas, fir'd with fury, breaks the crowd, 
and seeks his foe, and calls by name aloud: 
he runs within a narrower ring, and tries 
to stop the chariot; but the chariot flies. 
if he but gain a glimpse, juturna fears [[fear]], 
and far away the daunian hero bears. 
what should he do! nor [[arts]] nor arms avail; 
and various cares [[care]] in [[vain]] his [[mind]] assail. 
the [[great]] messapus, thund'ring thro' the field, 
in his left hand two pointed jav'lins held: 
encount'ring on the [[prince]], one dart he drew, 
and with unerring aim and utmost vigor threw. 
aeneas saw it come, and, stooping low 
beneath his buckler, shunn'd the threat'ning blow. 
the weapon hiss'd above his head, and tore 
the waving plume which on his helm he wore. 
forced by this hostile act, and fir'd with spite, 
that flying turnus still declin'd the [[fight]], 
the [[prince]], whose piety had long repell'd 
his inborn ardor, now invades the field; 
invokes the pow'rs of violated [[peace]], 
their rites and injur'd altars to redress; 
then, to his rage abandoning the rein, 
with [[blood]] and slaughter'd bodies [[body]] fills the plain. 
what [[god]] can tell, what numbers can display, 
the various labors of that fatal day; 
what chiefs [[chief]] and champions fell on either side, 
in combat slain, or by what deaths [[death]] they died; 
whom turnus, whom the trojan hero kill'd; 
who shar'd the fame and [[fortune]] of the field! 
jove, could'st thou view, and not avert thy sight, 
two jarring nations join'd in cruel [[fight]], 
whom leagues of lasting [[love]] so shortly shall unite! 
aeneas first rutulian sucro found, 
whose valor made the trojans quit their ground; 
betwixt his ribs the jav'lin drove so just, 
it reach'd his [[heart]], nor needs a second thrust. 
now turnus, at two blows, two brethren [[brother]] slew; 
first from his horse fierce amycus he threw: 
then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail'd 
diores, and in [[equal]] [[fight]] prevail'd. 
their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place; 
their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace. 
three cold on [[earth]] the trojan hero threw, 
whom without respite at one charge he slew: 
cethegus, tanais, tagus, fell oppress'd, 
and [[sad]] onythes, added to the rest, 
of theban [[blood]], whom peridia bore. 
turnus two brothers [[brother]] from the lycian shore, 
and from apollo's fane to [[battle]] sent, 
o'erthrew; nor phoebus could their [[fate]] prevent. 
peaceful menoetes after these he kill'd, 
who long had shunn'd the dangers of the field: 
on lerna's lake a silent [[life]] he [[led]], 
and with his nets and angle earn'd his bread; 
nor pompous cares [[care]], nor palaces, he knew, 
but wisely from th' infectious [[world]] withdrew: 
poor was his house; his father's painful hand 
discharg'd his rent, and plow'd another's [[land]]. 
as flames among the lofty woods are thrown 
on diff'rent sides, and both by winds are blown; 
the laurels crackle in the sputt'ring [[fire]]; 
the frighted sylvans from their shades retire: 
or as two neighb'ring torrents fall from high; 
rapid they run; the foamy waters fry; 
they roll to sea with unresisted [[force]], 
and down the rocks precipitate their course: 
not with less rage the rival heroes take 
their diff'rent ways, nor less destruction make. 
with spears afar, with swords [[sword]] at hand, they strike; 
and zeal of slaughter fires [[fire]] their souls [[soul]] alike. 
like them, their dauntless [[men]] maintain the field; 
and hearts [[heart]] are pierc'd, unknowing how to yield: 
they blow for blow return, and wound for wound; 
and heaps of bodies [[body]] raise the level ground. 
murranus, boasting of his [[blood]], that springs 
from a long [[royal]] [[race]] of latian kings [[king]], 
is by the trojan from his chariot thrown, 
crush'd with the weight of an unwieldy stone: 
betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore 
his living load, his dying [[body]] tore. 
his starting steeds, to shun the glitt'ring [[sword]], 
paw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their [[lord]]. 
fierce hyllus threaten'd high, and, face to face, 
affronted turnus in the middle space: 
the [[prince]] encounter'd him in full [[career]], 
and at his temples aim'd the deadly spear; 
so fatally the flying weapon sped, 
that thro' his helm it pierc'd his head. 
nor, cisseus, couldst thou scape from turnus' hand, 
in [[vain]] the strongest of th' arcadian band: 
nor to cupentus could his gods afford 
availing aid against th' aenean [[sword]], 
which to his naked [[heart]] pursued the course; 
nor could his plated shield sustain the [[force]]. 
iolas fell, whom not the grecian pow'rs, 
nor [[great]] subverter of the trojan tow'rs, 
were doom'd to kill, while heav'n prolong'd his date; 
but who can pass the bounds, prefix'd by [[fate]]? 
in high lyrnessus, and in troy, he held 
two palaces, and was from each expell'd: 
of all the mighty [[man]], the [[last]] remains 
a little spot of [[foreign]] [[earth]] contains. 
and now both hosts their broken [[troops]] unite 
in [[equal]] ranks, and mix in mortal [[fight]]. 
seresthus and undaunted mnestheus join 
the trojan, tuscan, and arcadian line: 
sea-born messapus, with atinas, heads 
the latin squadrons, and to [[battle]] leads. 
they strike, they push, they throng the scanty space, 
resolv'd on [[death]], impatient of disgrace; 
and, where one falls, another fills his place. 
the cyprian [[goddess]] now inspires her [[son]] 
to leave th' unfinish'd [[fight]], and storm the town: 
for, while he rolls his [[eyes]] around the plain 
in quest of turnus, whom he seeks in [[vain]], 
he views th' unguarded [[city]] from afar, 
in careless quiet, and secure of [[war]]. 
occasion offers, and excites his [[mind]] 
to dare beyond the task he first design'd. 
resolv'd, he calls his chiefs [[chief]]; they leave the [[fight]]: 
attended thus, he takes a neighb'ring height; 
the crowding [[troops]] about their gen'ral stand, 
all under arms, and wait his high command. 
then thus the lofty [[prince]]: "hear and obey, 
ye trojan bands, without the least delay 
jove is with us; and what i have decreed 
requires our utmost vigor, and our speed. 
your instant arms against the town prepare, 
the source of mischief, and the seat of [[war]]. 
this day the latian tow'rs, that mate the [[sky]], 
shall level with the plain in ashes [[lie]]: 
the [[people]] shall be slaves [[slave]], unless in [[time]] 
they kneel for pardon, and repent their crime. 
twice have our foes been vanquish'd on the plain: 
then shall i wait till turnus will be slain? 
your [[force]] against the perjur'd [[city]] bend. 
there it began, and there the [[war]] shall end. 
the [[peace]] profan'd our rightful arms requires; 
cleanse the polluted place with purging fires [[fire]]." 
he finish'd; and, one [[soul]] inspiring all, 
form'd in a wedge, the foot approach the wall. 
without the town, an unprovided train 
of gaping, gazing [[citizens]] are slain. 
some firebrands, others scaling ladders bear, 
and those they toss aloft, and these they rear: 
the flames now launch'd, the feather'd arrows fly, 
and clouds of missive arms obscure the [[sky]]. 
advancing to the front, the hero stands, 
and, stretching out to heav'n his pious hands, 
attests the gods, asserts his innocence, 
upbraids with breach of [[faith]] th' ausonian [[prince]]; 
declares the [[royal]] [[honor]] doubly stain'd, 
and twice the rites of holy [[peace]] profan'd. 
dissenting clamors in the town arise; 
each will be heard, and all at once advise. 
one part for [[peace]], and one for [[war]] contends; 
some would exclude their foes, and some admit their [[friends]].

the helpless [[king]] is hurried in the throng, 
and, whate'er tide prevails, is borne along. 
thus, when the swain, within a hollow rock, 
invades the bees with suffocating smoke, 
they run around, or labor on their wings, 
disus'd to flight, and shoot their sleepy stings; 
to shun the bitter fumes in [[vain]] they try; 
black vapors, issuing from the vent, involve the [[sky]]. 
but [[fate]] and envious [[fortune]] now prepare 
to plunge the latins in the [[last]] despair. 
the queen, who saw the foes invade the town, 
and brands on tops of burning houses thrown, 
cast round her [[eyes]], distracted with her fear- 
no [[troops]] of turnus in the field appear. 
once more she stares abroad, but still in [[vain]], 
and then concludes the [[royal]] [[youth]] is slain. 
mad with her anguish, impotent to bear 
the mighty [[grief]], she loathes the vital air. 
she calls herself the cause of all this ill, 
and owns the dire effects of her ungovern'd will; 
she raves against the gods; she beats her breast; 
she tears with both her hands her purple vest: 
then round a beam a running noose she tied, 
and, fasten'd by the neck, obscenely died. 
soon as the fatal news by fame was blown, 
and to her dames and to her [[daughter]] known, 
the [[sad]] lavinia rends her yellow hair 
and rosy cheeks; the rest her [[sorrow]] share: 
with shrieks the palace rings, and madness of despair. 
the spreading rumor fills the [[public]] place: 
confusion, [[fear]], distraction, and disgrace, 
and silent shame, are seen in ev'ry face. 
latinus tears his garments as he goes, 
both for his [[public]] and his private woes; 
with filth his venerable beard besmears, 
and sordid dust deforms his silver hairs. 
and much he blames the softness of his [[mind]], 
obnoxious to the charms of womankind, 
and soon seduc'd to [[change]] what he so well design'd; 
to break the solemn league so long desir'd, 
nor finish what his fates [[fate]], and those of troy, requir'd. 
now turnus rolls aloof o'er empty plains, 
and here and there some straggling foes he gleans. 
his flying coursers please him less and less, 
asham'd of easy [[fight]] and cheap [[success]]. 
thus half-contented, anxious in his [[mind]], 
the distant cries come driving in the wind, 
shouts from the walls, but shouts in murmurs drown'd; 
a jarring mixture, and a boding sound. 
"alas!" said he, "what mean these dismal cries? 
what doleful clamors from the town arise?" 
confus'd, he stops, and backward pulls the reins. 
she who the driver's office now sustains, 
replies: "neglect, my [[lord]], these new alarms; 
here [[fight]], and urge the [[fortune]] of your arms: 
there want not others to defend the wall. 
if by your rival's hand th' italians fall, 
so shall your fatal [[sword]] his [[friends]] [[oppress]], 
in [[honor]] [[equal]], [[equal]] in [[success]]." 
to this, the [[prince]]: "o sister- for i knew 
the [[peace]] infring'd proceeded first from you; 
i knew you, when you mingled first in [[fight]]; 
and now in [[vain]] you would [[deceive]] my sight- 
why, [[goddess]], this unprofitable [[care]]? 
who sent you down from heav'n, involv'd in air, 
your share of mortal sorrows [[sorrow]] to sustain, 
and see your [[brother]] bleeding on the plain? 
for to what pow'r can turnus have recourse, 
or how resist his fate's prevailing [[force]]? 
these [[eyes]] beheld murranus bite the ground: 
mighty the [[man]], and mighty was the wound. 
i heard my dearest friend, with dying breath, 
my name invoking to [[revenge]] his [[death]]. 
brave ufens fell with [[honor]] on the place, 
to shun the shameful sight of my disgrace. 
on [[earth]] supine, a manly corpse he lies [[lie]]; 
his vest and armor are the victor's prize. 
then, shall i see laurentum in a flame, 
which only wanted, to complete my shame? 
how will the latins hoot their champion's flight! 
how drances will insult and point them to the sight! 
is [[death]] so hard to bear? ye gods below, 
(since those above so small compassion show,) 
receive a [[soul]] unsullied yet with shame, 
which not belies my [[great]] forefather's name!" 
he said; and while he spoke, with flying speed 
came sages urging on his foamy steed: 
fix'd on his wounded face a shaft he bore, 
and, seeking turnus, sent his voice before: 
"turnus, on you, on you alone, depends 
our [[last]] relief: compassionate your friends! 
like lightning, fierce [[aeneas]], rolling on, 
with arms invests, with flames invades the town: 
the brands are toss'd on high; the winds conspire 
to drive along the deluge of the [[fire]]. 
all [[eyes]] are fix'd on you: your foes rejoice; 
ev'n the [[king]] staggers, and suspends his [[choice]]; 
doubts to deliver or defend the town, 
whom to reject, or whom to call his [[son]]. 
the queen, on whom your utmost hopes [[hope]] were plac'd, 
herself suborning [[death]], has breath'd her [[last]]. 
't is true, messapus, fearless of his [[fate]], 
with fierce atinas' aid, defends the gate: 
on ev'ry side surrounded by the foe, 
the more they kill, the greater numbers grow; 
an iron harvest mounts, and still remains to mow. 
you, far aloof from your forsaken bands, 
your rolling chariot drive o'er empty 
stupid he sate, his [[eyes]] on [[earth]] declin'd, 
and various cares [[care]] revolving in his [[mind]]: 
rage, boiling from the bottom of his breast, 
and [[sorrow]] mix'd with shame, his [[soul]] oppress'd; 
and conscious worth lay lab'ring in his [[thought]], 
and [[love]] by [[jealousy]] to madness wrought. 
by slow degrees [[degree]] his [[reason]] drove away 
the mists of passion, and resum'd her sway. 
then, rising on his car, he turn'd his look, 
and saw the town involv'd in [[fire]] and smoke. 
a wooden tow'r with flames already blaz'd, 
which his own hands on beams and rafters rais'd; 
and bridges laid above to join the space, 
and wheels below to roll from place to place. 
"sister, the fates [[fate]] have vanquish'd: let us go 
the way which heav'n and my hard [[fortune]] show. 
the [[fight]] is fix'd; nor shall the branded name 
of a base [[coward]] blot your brother's fame. 
death is my [[choice]]; but suffer me to try 
my [[force]], and vent my rage before i [[die]]." 
he said; and, leaping down without delay, 
thro' crowds of scatter'd foes he freed his way. 
striding he pass'd, impetuous as the wind, 
and left the grieving [[goddess]] far behind. 
as when a fragment, from a mountain torn 
by raging tempests, or by torrents borne, 
or sapp'd by [[time]], or loosen'd from the roots- 
prone thro' the void the rocky ruin shoots, 
rolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep; 
down sink, at once, the shepherds and their sheep: 
involv'd alike, they rush to nether ground; 
stunn'd with the shock they fall, and stunn'd from [[earth]] rebound:

so turnus, hasting headlong to the town, 
should'ring and shoving, bore the squadrons down. 
still pressing onward, to the walls he drew, 
where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew, 
and sanguine streams the slipp'ry ground embrue. 
first stretching out his arm, in sign of [[peace]], 
he cries aloud, to make the combat cease: 
"rutulians, hold; and latin [[troops]], retire! 
the [[fight]] is mine; and me the gods require. 
't is just that i should vindicate alone 
the broken truce, or for the breach atone. 
this day shall [[free]] from wars [[war]] th' ausonian [[state]], 
or finish my misfortunes in my [[fate]]." 
both armies [[army]] from their bloody [[work]] desist, 
and, bearing backward, form a spacious list. 
the trojan hero, who receiv'd from fame 
the welcome sound, and heard the champion's name, 
soon leaves the taken works [[work]] and mounted walls, 
greedy of [[war]] where greater [[glory]] calls. 
he springs to [[fight]], exulting in his [[force]] 
his jointed armor rattles in the course. 
like eryx, or like athos, [[great]] he shows, 
or [[father]] apennine, when, [[white]] with snows, 
his head [[divine]] obscure in clouds he hides, 
and shakes the sounding forest on his sides. 
the nations, overaw'd, surcease the [[fight]]; 
immovable their bodies [[body]], fix'd their sight. 
ev'n [[death]] stands still; nor from above they throw 
their darts, nor drive their batt'ring-rams below. 
in silent order either [[army]] stands, 
and drop their swords [[sword]], unknowing, from their hands. 
th' ausonian [[king]] beholds, with wond'ring sight, 
two mighty champions match'd in [[single]] [[fight]], 
born under climes remote, and brought by [[fate]], 
with swords [[sword]] to try their titles to the [[state]]. 
now, in clos'd field, each other from afar 
they view; and, rushing on, begin the [[war]]. 
they launch their spears; then hand to hand they meet; 
the trembling soil resounds beneath their feet: 
their bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high, 
and flakes of [[fire]] from their hard helmets fly. 
courage conspires with [[chance]], and both ingage 
with [[equal]] [[fortune]] yet, and mutual rage. 
as when two bulls for their [[fair]] female [[fight]] 
in sila's shades, or on taburnus' height; 
with horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies; 
mute stands the herd; the heifers roll their [[eyes]], 
and wait th' event; which victor they shall bear, 
and who shall be the [[lord]], to [[rule]] the lusty year: 
with rage of [[love]] the [[jealous]] rivals burn, 
and push for push, and wound for wound return; 
their dewlaps gor'd, their sides are lav'd in [[blood]]; 
loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro' the wood: 
such was the combat in the listed ground; 
so clash their swords [[sword]], and so their shields resound. 
jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays 
the champions' [[fate]], and each exactly weighs. 
on this side, [[life]] and lucky [[chance]] ascends; 
loaded with [[death]], that other scale descends. 
rais'd on the stretch, [[young]] turnus aims a blow 
full on the helm of his unguarded foe: 
shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side, 
as hopes [[hope]] and fears [[fear]] their panting hearts [[heart]] divide. 
but all in pieces flies the traitor [[sword]], 
and, in the middle stroke, deserts his [[lord]]. 
now is but [[death]], or flight; disarm'd he flies, 
when in his hand an unknown hilt he spies. 
fame says that turnus, when his steeds he join'd, 
hurrying to [[war]], disorder'd in his [[mind]], 
snatch'd the first weapon which his haste could find. 
't was not the fated [[sword]] his [[father]] bore, 
but that his charioteer metiscus wore. 
this, while the trojans fled, the toughness held; 
but, [[vain]] against the [[great]] vulcanian shield, 
the mortal-temper'd steel deceiv'd his hand: 
the shiver'd fragments shone amid the sand. 
surpris'd with [[fear]], he fled along the field, 
and now forthright, and now in orbits wheel'd; 
for here the trojan [[troops]] the list surround, 
and there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy ground.

aeneas hastens, tho' with heavier pace- 
his wound, so newly knit, retards the chase, 
and oft his trembling knees their aid refuse- 
yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues. 
thus, when a fearful stag is clos'd around 
with crimson toils, or in a river found, 
high on the bank the deep-mouth'd hound appears, 
still opening, following still, where'er he steers; 
the persecuted creature, to and fro, 
turns here and there, to scape his umbrian foe: 
steep is th' ascent, and, if he gains the [[land]], 
the purple [[death]] is pitch'd along the strand. 
his eager foe, determin'd to the chase, 
stretch'd at his length, gains ground at ev'ry pace; 
now to his beamy head he makes his way, 
and now he holds, or thinks [[think]] he holds, his prey: 
just at the pinch, the stag springs out with [[fear]]; 
he bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air:

the rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries; 
the mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies [[sky]]. 
thus flies the daunian [[prince]], and, flying, blames 
his tardy [[troops]], and, calling by their names, 
demands his trusty [[sword]]. the trojan threats 
the realm with ruin, and their ancient seats 
to lay in ashes, if they dare supply 
with arms or aid his vanquish'd [[enemy]]: 
thus menacing, he still pursues the course, 
with vigor, tho' diminish'd of his [[force]]. 
ten times [[time]] already round the listed place 
one [[chief]] had fled, and t' other giv'n the chase: 
no trivial prize is play'd; for on the [[life]] 
or [[death]] of turnus now depends the strife. 
within the space, an olive tree had stood, 
a [[sacred]] shade, a venerable wood, 
for vows to faunus paid, the latins' guardian [[god]]. 
here hung the vests, and tablets were ingrav'd, 
of sinking mariners from shipwrack sav'd. 
with heedless hands the trojans fell'd the tree, 
to make the ground inclos'd for combat [[free]]. 
deep in the root, whether by [[fate]], or [[chance]], 
or erring haste, the trojan drove his lance; 
then stoop'd, and tugg'd with [[force]] immense, to [[free]] 
th' incumber'd spear from the tenacious tree; 
that, whom his fainting limbs pursued in [[vain]], 
his flying weapon might from far attain. 
confus'd with [[fear]], bereft of [[human]] aid, 
then turnus to the gods, and first to faunus pray'd: 
"o faunus, pity! and thou [[mother]] [[earth]], 
where i thy foster [[son]] receiv'd my birth, 
hold fast the steel! if my [[religious]] hand 
your plant has honor'd, which your foes profan'd, 
propitious hear my pious pray'r!" he said, 
nor with successless vows invok'd their aid. 
th' incumbent hero wrench'd, and pull'd, and strain'd; 
but still the stubborn [[earth]] the steel detain'd. 
juturna took her [[time]]; and, while in [[vain]] 
he strove, assum'd meticus' form again, 
and, in that imitated shape, restor'd 
to the despairing [[prince]] his daunian [[sword]]. 
the queen of [[love]], who, with disdain and [[grief]], 
saw the bold [[nymph]] afford this prompt relief, 
t' assert her offspring with a greater deed, 
from the tough root the ling'ring weapon freed. 
once more erect, the rival chiefs [[chief]] advance: 
one trusts the [[sword]], and one the pointed lance; 
and both resolv'd alike to try their fatal [[chance]]. 
meantime imperial jove to juno spoke, 
who from a shining cloud beheld the shock: 
"what new arrest, o queen of heav'n, is sent 
to stop the fates [[fate]] now lab'ring in th' event? 
what farther hopes [[hope]] are left thee to pursue? 
divine [[aeneas]], (and thou know'st it too,) 
foredoom'd, to these celestial seats are due. 
what more attempts for turnus can be made, 
that thus thou ling'rest in this lonely shade? 
is it becoming of the due [[respect]] 
and awful [[honor]] of a [[god]] elect, 
a wound unworthy of our [[state]] to [[feel]], 
patient of [[human]] hands and earthly steel? 
or seems it just, the sister should restore 
a second [[sword]], when one was lost before, 
and arm a conquer'd wretch against his conqueror? 
for what, without thy [[knowledge]] and avow, 
nay more, thy dictate, durst juturna do? 
at [[last]], in deference to my [[love]], forbear 
to lodge within thy [[soul]] this anxious [[care]]; 
reclin'd upon my breast, thy [[grief]] unload: 
who should relieve the [[goddess]], but the [[god]]? 
now all things to their utmost issue tend, 
push'd by the fates [[fate]] to their appointed 
while leave was giv'n thee, and a lawful hour 
for vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow'r, 
toss'd on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress, 
and, driv'n ashore, with hostile arms [[oppress]]; 
deform the [[royal]] house; and, from the side 
of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride: 
now cease at my command." the thund'rer said; 
and, with dejected [[eyes]], this [[answer]] juno made: 
"because your dread decree too well i knew, 
from turnus and from [[earth]] unwilling i withdrew. 
else should you not behold me here, alone, 
involv'd in empty clouds, my [[friends]] bemoan, 
but, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight 
engag'd against my foes in mortal [[fight]]. 
't is true, juturna mingled in the strife 
by my command, to save her brother's life- 
at least to try; but, by the stygian lake, 
(the most [[religious]] oath the gods can take,) 
with this restriction, not to bend the bow, 
or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw. 
and now, resign'd to your superior might, 
and tir'd with fruitless toils, i loathe the [[fight]]. 
this let me beg (and this no fates [[fate]] withstand) 
both for myself and for your father's [[land]], 
that, when the nuptial bed shall bind the [[peace]], 
(which i, since you ordain, [[consent]] to bless,) 
the laws [[law]] of either nation be the same; 
but let the latins still retain their name, 
speak the same [[language]] which they spoke before, 
wear the same habits which their grandsires wore. 
call them not trojans: perish the renown 
and name of troy, with that detested town. 
latium be latium still; let alba reign 
and rome's [[immortal]] majesty remain." 
then thus the founder of [[mankind]] replies 
(unruffled was his front, serene his eyes) 
"can saturn's issue, and heav'n's other heir, 
such endless anger in her bosom bear? 
be mistress, and your full desires [[desire]] obtain; 
but quench the choler you foment in [[vain]]. 
from ancient [[blood]] th' ausonian [[people]] sprung, 
shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue. 
the trojans to their customs shall be tied: 
i will, myself, their [[common]] rites provide; 
the natives shall command, the foreigners subside. 
all shall be latium; troy without a name; 
and her lost sons [[son]] forget from whence they came. 
from [[blood]] so mix'd, a pious [[race]] shall flow, 
equal to gods, excelling all below. 
no nation more [[respect]] to you shall [[pay]], 
or greater off'rings on your altars lay." 
juno consents, well pleas'd that her desires [[desire]] 
had found [[success]], and from the cloud retires. 
the [[peace]] thus made, the thund'rer next prepares 
to [[force]] the wat'ry [[goddess]] from the wars [[war]]. 
deep in the dismal regions void of [[light]], 
three daughters [[daughter]] at a birth were born to night: 
these their brown [[mother]], brooding on her [[care]], 
indued with windy wings to flit in air, 
with serpents girt alike, and crown'd with hissing hair.

in heav'n the dirae call'd, and still at hand, 
before the [[throne]] of angry jove they stand, 
his ministers of wrath, and ready still 
the minds [[mind]] of mortal [[men]] with fears [[fear]] to fill, 
whene'er the moody sire, to wreak his hate 
on realms or towns deserving of their [[fate]], 
hurls down diseases, [[death]] and deadly [[care]], 
and terrifies the guilty [[world]] with [[war]]. 
one sister plague if these from heav'n he sent, 
to fright juturna with a dire portent. 
the pest comes whirling down: by far more slow 
springs the swift arrow from the parthian bow, 
or cydon yew, when, traversing the skies [[sky]], 
and drench'd in pois'nous juice, the sure destruction flies.

with such a sudden and unseen a flight 
shot thro' the clouds the [[daughter]] of the night. 
soon as the field inclos'd she had in view, 
and from afar her destin'd quarry knew, 
contracted, to the boding bird she turns, 
which haunts the ruin'd piles and hallow'd urns, 
and beats about the tombs with nightly wings, 
where songs [[song]] obscene on sepulchers she sings. 
thus lessen'd in her form, with frightful cries 
the fury round unhappy turnus flies, 
flaps on his shield, and flutters o'er his [[eyes]]. 
a lazy chillness crept along his [[blood]]; 
chok'd was his voice; his hair with [[horror]] stood. 
juturna from afar beheld her fly, 
and knew th' ill omen, by her screaming cry 
and stridor of her wings. amaz'd with [[fear]], 
her beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing hair.

"ah me!" she cries, "in this unequal strife 
what can thy sister more to save thy [[life]]? 
weak as i am, can i, alas! contend 
in arms with that inexorable fiend? 
now, now, i quit the field! forbear to fright 
my tender [[soul]], ye baleful birds of night; 
the lashing of your wings i [[know]] too well, 
the sounding flight, and fun'ral screams of hell! 
these are the gifts you bring from haughty jove, 
the worthy recompense of ravish'd love! 
did he for this exempt my [[life]] from [[fate]]? 
o hard conditions of [[immortal]] [[state]], 
tho' born to [[death]], not privileg'd to [[die]], 
but forc'd to bear impos'd eternity! 
take back your envious bribes, and let me go 
companion to my brother's ghost below! 
the joys are vanish'd: nothing now remains, 
of [[life]] [[immortal]], but [[immortal]] pains [[pain]]. 
what [[earth]] will open her devouring womb, 
to rest a weary [[goddess]] in the tomb!" 
she drew a length of sighs; nor more she said, 
but in her azure mantle wrapp'd her head, 
then plung'd into her stream, with deep despair, 
and her [[last]] sobs came bubbling up in air. 
now stern [[aeneas]] his weighty spear 
against his foe, and thus upbraids his [[fear]]: 
"what farther subterfuge can turnus find? 
what empty hopes [[hope]] are harbor'd in his [[mind]]? 
't is not thy swiftness can secure thy flight; 
not with their feet, but hands, the valiant [[fight]]. 
vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare 
what [[skill]] and [[courage]] can attempt in [[war]]; 
wish for the wings of winds, to mount the [[sky]]; 
or hid, within the hollow [[earth]] to lie!" 
the champion shook his head, and made this short reply: 
"no threats of thine my manly [[mind]] can move; 
't is hostile heav'n i dread, and partial jove." 
he said no more, but, with a sigh, repress'd 
the mighty [[sorrow]] in his swelling breast. 
then, as he roll'd his troubled [[eyes]] around, 
an antique stone he saw, the [[common]] bound 
of neighb'ring fields, and barrier of the ground; 
so vast, that twelve [[strong]] [[men]] of [[modern]] days 
th' enormous weight from [[earth]] could hardly raise. 
he heav'd it at a lift, and, pois'd on high, 
ran stagg'ring on against his [[enemy]], 
but so disorder'd, that he scarcely knew 
his way, or what unwieldly weight he threw. 
his knocking knees are bent beneath the load, 
and shiv'ring cold congeals his vital [[blood]]. 
the stone drops from his arms, and, falling short 
for want of vigor, mocks his [[vain]] effort. 
and as, when heavy sleep has clos'd the sight, 
the sickly fancy labors in the night; 
we seem to run; and, destitute of [[force]], 
our sinking limbs forsake us in the course: 
in [[vain]] we heave for breath; in [[vain]] we cry; 
the nerves, unbrac'd, their usual [[strength]] deny; 
and on the tongue the falt'ring accents [[die]]: 
so turnus far'd; whatever means he tried, 
all [[force]] of arms and points of art [[arts]] employ'd, 
the fury flew athwart, and made th' endeavor void. 
a thousand various thoughts [[thought]] his [[soul]] confound; 
he star'd about, nor aid nor issue found; 
his own [[men]] stop the pass, and his own walls surround. 
once more he pauses, and looks out again, 
and seeks the [[goddess]] charioteer in [[vain]]. 
trembling he views the thund'ring [[chief]] advance, 
and brandishing aloft the deadly lance: 
amaz'd he cow'rs beneath his conqu'ring foe, 
forgets to ward, and waits the coming blow. 
astonish'd while he stands, and fix'd with [[fear]], 
aim'd at his shield he sees th' impending spear. 
the hero measur'd first, with narrow view, 
the destin'd mark; and, rising as he threw, 
with its full swing the fatal weapon flew. 
not with less rage the rattling thunder falls, 
or stones from batt'ring-engines break the walls: 
swift as a whirlwind, from an arm so [[strong]], 
the lance drove on, and bore the [[death]] along. 
naught could his sev'nfold shield the [[prince]] avail, 
nor aught, beneath his arms, the coat of mail: 
it pierc'd thro' all, and with a grisly wound 
transfix'd his thigh, and doubled him to ground. 
with groans the latins rend the vaulted [[sky]]: 
woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply. 
now low on [[earth]] the lofty [[chief]] is laid, 
with [[eyes]] cast upward, and with arms display'd, 
and, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray'd: 
"i [[know]] my [[death]] deserv'd, nor [[hope]] to [[live]]: 
use what the gods and thy [[good]] [[fortune]] give. 
yet [[think]], o [[think]], if [[mercy]] may be shown- 
thou hadst a [[father]] once, and hast a son- 
pity my sire, now sinking to the grave; 
and for anchises' sake old daunus save! 
or, if thy vow'd [[revenge]] pursue my [[death]], 
give to my [[friends]] my [[body]] void of breath! 
the latian chiefs [[chief]] have seen me beg my [[life]]; 
thine is the [[conquest]], thine the [[royal]] [[wife]]: 
against a yielded [[man]], 't is mean ignoble strife." 
in deep suspense the trojan seem'd to stand, 
and, just prepar'd to strike, repress'd his hand. 
he roll'd his [[eyes]], and ev'ry moment [[felt]] 
his manly [[soul]] with more compassion melt; 
when, casting down a casual glance, he spied 
the golden belt that glitter'd on his side, 
the fatal spoils which haughty turnus tore 
from dying pallas, and in triumph wore. 
then, rous'd anew to wrath, he loudly cries 
(flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes) 
"traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend, 
clad, as thou art [[arts]], in trophies of my friend? 
to his [[sad]] [[soul]] a grateful off'ring go! 
't is pallas, pallas gives this deadly blow." 
he rais'd his arm aloft, and, at the word, 
deep in his bosom drove the shining [[sword]]. 
the streaming [[blood]] distain'd his arms around, 
and the disdainful [[soul]] came rushing thro' the wound.
