the forethought


herein [[lie]] buried many things which if [[read]] with patience may show the
strange meaning of being black here at the dawning of the twentieth
century. this meaning is not without interest to you, gentle reader;
for the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color
line. i [[pray]] you, then, receive my little [[book]] in all charity, studying
my words with me, forgiving mistake and foible for sake of the faith
and passion that is in me, and seeking the grain of [[truth]] hidden there.

i have sought here to sketch, in vague, uncertain outline, the
spiritual [[world]] in which ten thousand thousand americans [[live]] and
strive. first, in two chapters [[chapter]] i have tried to show what emancipation
meant to them, and what was its aftermath. in a third [[chapter]] i have
pointed out the slow rise of personal leadership, and criticized
candidly the leader who bears the [[chief]] burden of his [[race]] to-day.
then, in two other chapters [[chapter]] i have sketched in swift outline the two
worlds within and without the veil, and thus have come to the central
problem of training [[men]] for [[life]]. venturing now into deeper detail, i
have in two chapters [[chapter]] [[studied]] the struggles of the massed millions of
the black peasantry, and in another have sought to make clear the
present relations of the sons [[son]] of master and [[man]]. leaving, then, the
white [[world]], i have stepped within the veil, raising it that you may
view faintly its deeper recesses,—the meaning of its [[religion]], the
passion of its [[human]] [[sorrow]], and the struggle of its greater souls [[soul]]. all
this i have ended with a tale twice told but seldom written, and a
chapter of [[song]].

some of these thoughts [[thought]] of mine have seen the [[light]] before in other
guise. for kindly consenting to their republication here, in altered
and extended form, i must thank the publishers of the atlantic monthly,
the world’s [[work]], the dial, the new [[world]], and the annals of the
american academy of [[political]] and social [[science]]. before each [[chapter]],
as now printed, stands a bar of the [[sorrow]] songs [[song]],—some echo of haunting
melody from the only american [[music]] which welled up from black souls [[soul]] in
the dark [[past]]. and, finally, need i add that i who speak here am bone
of the bone and flesh of the flesh of them that [[live]] within the veil?

i.
of our [[spiritual]] strivings

o water, voice of my [[heart]], crying in the sand,
    all night long crying with a mournful cry,
as i [[lie]] and listen, and cannot understand
        the voice of my [[heart]] in my side or the voice of the sea,
    o water, crying for rest, is it i, is it i?
        all night long the water is crying to me.


unresting water, there shall never be rest
    till the [[last]] moon droop and the [[last]] tide fail,
and the [[fire]] of the end begin to burn in the west;
        and the [[heart]] shall be weary and wonder and cry like the sea,
    all [[life]] long crying without avail,
        as the water all night long is crying to me.

between me and the other [[world]] there is ever an unasked [[question]]:
unasked by some through feelings of delicacy; by others through the
difficulty of rightly framing it. all, nevertheless, flutter round it.
they approach me in a half-hesitant sort of way, eye me curiously or
compassionately, and then, instead of saying directly, how does it feel
to be a problem? they say, i [[know]] an excellent colored [[man]] in my town;
or, i fought at mechanicsville; or, do not these southern outrages make
your [[blood]] boil? at these i smile, or am interested, or reduce the
boiling to a simmer, as the [[occasion]] may require. to the real [[question]],
how does it [[feel]] to be a problem? i [[answer]] seldom a word.

and yet, being a problem is a [[strange]] [[experience]],—peculiar even for one
who has never been anything else, save perhaps in babyhood and in
europe. it is in the early days of rollicking boyhood that the
revelation first bursts upon one, all in a day, as it were. i remember
well when the shadow swept across me. i was a little thing, away up in
the hills of new [[england]], where the dark housatonic winds between
hoosac and taghkanic to the sea. in a wee wooden schoolhouse, something
put it into the boys’ and girls’ heads to buy gorgeous
visiting-cards—ten cents a package—and exchange. the exchange was
merry, till one girl, a tall newcomer, refused my card,—refused it
peremptorily, with a glance. then it dawned upon me with a certain
suddenness that i was different from the others; or like, mayhap, in
heart and [[life]] and longing, but shut out from their [[world]] by a vast
veil. i had thereafter no [[desire]] to tear down that veil, to creep
through; i held all beyond it in [[common]] contempt, and lived above it in
a region of blue [[sky]] and [[great]] wandering shadows. that [[sky]] was bluest
when i could beat my mates at examination-time, or beat them at a
foot-race, or even beat their stringy heads. alas, with the years all
this fine contempt began to fade; for the words i longed for, and all
their dazzling opportunities, were theirs, not mine. but they should
not keep these prizes, i said; some, all, i would wrest from them. just
how i would do it i could never decide: by reading [[law]], by healing the
sick, by telling the wonderful tales that swam in my head,—some way.
with other black boys the strife was not so fiercely sunny: their youth
shrunk into tasteless sycophancy, or into silent [[hatred]] of the pale
world about them and mocking distrust of everything [[white]]; or wasted
itself in a bitter cry, why did [[god]] make me an outcast and a stranger
in mine own house? the shades of the prison-house closed round about us
all: walls strait and stubborn to the whitest, but relentlessly narrow,
tall, and unscalable to sons [[son]] of night who must plod darkly on in
resignation, or beat unavailing palms against the stone, or steadily,
half hopelessly, watch the streak of blue above.

after the egyptian and [[indian]], the [[greek]] and roman, the teuton and
mongolian, the negro is a sort of seventh [[son]], born with a veil, and
gifted with second-sight in this american [[world]],—a [[world]] which yields
him no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through
the revelation of the other [[world]]. it is a peculiar sensation, this
double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one’s self
through the [[eyes]] of others, of measuring one’s [[soul]] by the tape of a
world that looks on in amused contempt and [[pity]]. one ever feels [[feel]] his
twoness,—an american, a negro; two souls [[soul]], two thoughts [[thought]], two
unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark [[body]], whose
dogged [[strength]] alone keeps it from being torn asunder.

the [[history]] of the american negro is the [[history]] of this strife,—this
longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double [[self]] into
a [[better]] and truer [[self]]. in this merging he wishes [[wish]] neither of the older
selves to be lost. he would not africanize [[america]], for [[america]] has too
much to [[teach]] the [[world]] and [[africa]]. he would not bleach his negro soul
in a flood of [[white]] americanism, for he knows [[know]] that negro [[blood]] has a
message for the [[world]]. he simply wishes [[wish]] to make it possible for a man
to be both a negro and an american, without being cursed and spit upon
by his fellows, without having the doors of opportunity closed roughly
in his face.

this, then, is the end of his striving: to be a co-worker in the
kingdom of [[culture]], to escape both [[death]] and isolation, to husband and
use his [[best]] powers [[power]] and his latent genius. these powers [[power]] of [[body]] and
mind have in the [[past]] been strangely wasted, dispersed, or forgotten.
the shadow of a mighty negro [[past]] flits through the tale of ethiopia
the shadowy and of [[egypt]] the sphinx. through [[history]], the powers [[power]] of
single black [[men]] flash here and there like falling stars, and die
sometimes before the [[world]] has rightly gauged their brightness. here in
america, in the few days since emancipation, the black man’s turning
hither and thither in hesitant and doubtful striving has often made his
very [[strength]] to lose effectiveness, to seem like absence of [[power]],
like weakness. and yet it is not weakness,—it is the contradiction of
double aims. the double-aimed struggle of the black artisan—on the one
hand to escape [[white]] contempt for a nation of mere hewers of wood and
drawers of water, and on the other hand to plough and nail and dig for
a poverty-stricken horde—could only result in making him a poor
craftsman, for he had but half a [[heart]] in either cause. by the poverty
and ignorance of his [[people]], the negro minister or doctor was tempted
toward quackery and demagogy; and by the criticism of the other [[world]],
toward ideals that made him ashamed of his lowly tasks. the would-be
black savant was confronted by the paradox that the [[knowledge]] his
people needed was a twice-told tale to his [[white]] neighbors, while the
knowledge which would [[teach]] the [[white]] [[world]] was [[greek]] to his own flesh
and [[blood]]. the innate [[love]] of harmony and [[beauty]] that set the ruder
souls of his [[people]] a-dancing and a-singing raised but confusion and
doubt in the [[soul]] of the black artist; for the [[beauty]] revealed to him
was the soul-beauty of a [[race]] which his larger audience despised, and
he could not articulate the message of another [[people]]. this waste of
double aims, this seeking to satisfy two unreconciled ideals, has
wrought [[sad]] havoc with the [[courage]] and [[faith]] and deeds of ten thousand
thousand [[people]],—has sent them often wooing false gods and invoking
false means of salvation, and at times [[time]] has even seemed about to make
them ashamed of themselves.

away back in the days of bondage they [[thought]] to see in one divine
event the end of all [[doubt]] and disappointment; few [[men]] ever worshipped
freedom with half such unquestioning [[faith]] as did the american negro
for two centuries. to him, so far as he [[thought]] and dreamed, slavery
was indeed the sum of all villainies, the cause of all [[sorrow]], the root
of all prejudice; emancipation was the key to a promised [[land]] of
sweeter [[beauty]] than ever stretched before the [[eyes]] of wearied
israelites. in [[song]] and exhortation swelled one refrain—liberty; in his
tears and curses the [[god]] he implored had [[freedom]] in his [[right]] hand. at
last it came,—suddenly, fearfully, like a [[dream]]. with one wild carnival
of [[blood]] and passion came the message in his own plaintive cadences:—

“shout, o children!
shout, you’re free!
for [[god]] has bought your liberty!”


years have passed away since then,—ten, twenty, forty; forty years of
national [[life]], forty years of renewal and [[development]], and yet the
swarthy spectre sits in its accustomed seat at the nation’s feast. in
vain do we cry to this our vastest social problem:—

“take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
shall never tremble!”


the nation has not yet found [[peace]] from its sins [[sin]]; the freedman has not
yet found in [[freedom]] his promised [[land]]. whatever of [[good]] may have come
in these years of [[change]], the shadow of a deep disappointment rests
upon the negro [[people]],—a disappointment all the more bitter because the
unattained ideal was unbounded save by the simple ignorance of a lowly
people.

the first decade was merely a prolongation of the [[vain]] search for
freedom, the boon that seemed ever barely to elude their grasp,—like a
tantalizing will-o’-the-wisp, maddening and misleading the headless
host. the holocaust of [[war]], the terrors of the ku-klux klan, the lies
of carpet-baggers, the disorganization of industry, and the
contradictory [[advice]] of [[friends]] and foes, left the bewildered serf with
no new watchword beyond the old cry for [[freedom]]. as the [[time]] flew,
however, he began to grasp a new [[idea]]. the ideal of [[liberty]] demanded
for its attainment powerful means, and these the fifteenth amendment
gave him. the ballot, which before he had looked upon as a visible sign
of [[freedom]], he now regarded as the [[chief]] means of gaining and
perfecting the [[liberty]] with which [[war]] had partially endowed him. and
why not? had not votes made [[war]] and emancipated millions? had not votes
enfranchised the freedmen? was anything impossible to a [[power]] that had
done all this? a million black [[men]] started with renewed zeal to vote
themselves into the [[kingdom]]. so the decade flew away, the [[revolution]] of
1876 came, and left the half-free serf weary, wondering, but still
inspired. slowly but steadily, in the following years, a new vision
began gradually to replace the [[dream]] of [[political]] [[power]],—a powerful
movement, the rise of another ideal to guide the unguided, another
pillar of [[fire]] by night after a clouded day. it was the ideal of
“book-learning”; the curiosity, born of compulsory ignorance, to know
and test the [[power]] of the cabalistic letters of the [[white]] [[man]], the
longing to [[know]]. here at [[last]] seemed to have been discovered the
mountain path to canaan; longer than the highway of emancipation and
law, steep and rugged, but straight, leading to heights high enough to
overlook [[life]].

up the new path the advance guard toiled, slowly, heavily, doggedly;
only those who have watched and guided the faltering feet, the misty
minds, the dull understandings, of the dark pupils of these schools
know how faithfully, how piteously, this [[people]] strove to learn. it was
weary [[work]]. the cold statistician wrote down the inches of progress
here and there, noted also where here and there a foot had slipped or
some one had fallen. to the tired climbers, the horizon was ever dark,
the mists were often cold, the canaan was always dim and far away. if,
however, the vistas disclosed as yet no goal, no resting-place, little
but [[flattery]] and criticism, the [[journey]] at least gave leisure for
reflection and self-examination; it changed the child of emancipation
to the [[youth]] with dawning self-consciousness, self-realization,
self-respect. in those sombre forests of his striving his own [[soul]] rose
before him, and he saw himself,—darkly as through a veil; and yet he
saw in himself some faint revelation of his [[power]], of his mission. he
began to have a dim feeling that, to attain his place in the [[world]], he
must be himself, and not another. for the first [[time]] he sought to
analyze the burden he bore upon his back, that dead-weight of social
degradation partially masked behind a half-named negro problem. he felt
his [[poverty]]; without a cent, without a [[home]], without [[land]], tools, or
savings, he had entered into competition with [[rich]], landed, skilled
neighbors. to be a [[poor]] [[man]] is hard, but to be a [[poor]] [[race]] in a [[land]] of
dollars is the very bottom of hardships. he [[felt]] the weight of his
ignorance,—not simply of letters, but of [[life]], of [[business]], of the
humanities; the accumulated sloth and shirking and awkwardness of
decades and centuries shackled his hands and feet. nor was his burden
all [[poverty]] and ignorance. the red stain of bastardy, which two
centuries of systematic legal defilement of negro [[women]] had stamped
upon his [[race]], meant not only the loss of ancient african chastity, but
also the hereditary weight of a mass of [[corruption]] from white
adulterers, threatening almost the obliteration of the negro [[home]].

a [[people]] thus handicapped ought not to be [[asked]] to [[race]] with the [[world]],
but rather allowed to give all its [[time]] and [[thought]] to its own social
problems. but alas! while sociologists gleefully count his bastards and
his prostitutes, the very [[soul]] of the toiling, sweating black [[man]] is
darkened by the shadow of a vast despair. [[men]] call the shadow
prejudice, and learnedly explain it as the [[natural]] defence of culture
against barbarism, learning against ignorance, purity against crime,
the “higher” against the “lower” races [[race]]. to which the negro cries amen!
and swears that to so much of this [[strange]] prejudice as is founded on
just homage to [[civilization]], [[culture]], [[righteousness]], and [[progress]], he
humbly bows and meekly does obeisance. but before that nameless
prejudice that leaps beyond all this he stands helpless, dismayed, and
well-nigh speechless; before that personal disrespect and mockery, the
ridicule and systematic humiliation, the distortion of [[fact]] and wanton
license of fancy, the cynical ignoring of the [[better]] and the boisterous
welcoming of the worse, the all-pervading [[desire]] to inculcate disdain
for everything black, from toussaint to the [[devil]],—before this there
rises a sickening despair that would disarm and discourage any nation
save that black host to whom “discouragement” is an unwritten word.

but the facing of so vast a prejudice could not but bring the
inevitable self-questioning, self-disparagement, and lowering of ideals
which ever accompany repression and breed in an atmosphere of contempt
and hate. whisperings and portents came [[home]] upon the four winds: lo!
we are diseased and dying, cried the dark hosts; we cannot write, our
voting is [[vain]]; what need of [[education]], since we must always cook and
serve? and the nation echoed and enforced this self-criticism, saying:
be content to be servants, and nothing more; what need of higher
culture for half-men? away with the black man’s ballot, by [[force]] or
fraud,—and behold the suicide of a race! nevertheless, out of the evil
came something of [[good]],—the more careful adjustment of [[education]] to
real [[life]], the clearer perception of the negroes’ social
responsibilities, and the sobering realization of the meaning of
progress.

so dawned the [[time]] of _sturm und drang:_ storm and stress to-day rocks
our little boat on the mad waters of the world-sea; there is within and
without the sound of conflict, the burning of [[body]] and rending of [[soul]];
inspiration strives with [[doubt]], and [[faith]] with [[vain]] questionings. the
bright ideals of the [[past]],—physical [[freedom]], [[political]] [[power]], the
training of brains and the training of hands,—all these in turn have
waxed and waned, until even the [[last]] grows dim and overcast. are they
all [[wrong]],—all false? no, not that, but each alone was over-simple and
incomplete,—the dreams [[dream]] of a credulous race-childhood, or the fond
imaginings of the other [[world]] which does not [[know]] and does not want to
know our [[power]]. to be really true, all these ideals must be melted and
welded into one. the training of the schools we need to-day more than
ever,—the training of deft hands, quick [[eyes]] and ears, and above all
the broader, deeper, higher [[culture]] of gifted minds [[mind]] and pure hearts [[heart]].
the [[power]] of the ballot we need in sheer self-defence,—else what shall
save us from a second [[slavery]]? [[freedom]], too, the long-sought, we still
seek,—the [[freedom]] of [[life]] and limb, the [[freedom]] to [[work]] and [[think]], the
freedom to [[love]] and aspire. [[work]], [[culture]], [[liberty]],—all these we need,
not singly but together, not successively but together, each growing
and aiding each, and all striving toward that vaster ideal that swims
before the negro [[people]], the ideal of [[human]] brotherhood, gained through
the unifying ideal of [[race]]; the ideal of fostering and developing the
traits and [[talents]] of the negro, not in opposition to or contempt for
other races [[race]], but rather in large conformity to the greater ideals of
the american [[republic]], in order that some day on american soil two
world-races may give each to each those characteristics both so sadly
lack. we the darker ones come even now not altogether empty-handed:
there are to-day no truer exponents of the pure [[human]] spirit of the
declaration of independence than the american negroes; there is no true
american [[music]] but the wild sweet melodies of the negro [[slave]]; the
american fairy tales and folklore are [[indian]] and african; and, all in
all, we black [[men]] seem the sole oasis of simple [[faith]] and reverence in
a dusty desert of dollars and smartness. will [[america]] be poorer if she
replace her brutal dyspeptic blundering with light-hearted but
determined negro [[humility]]? or her coarse and cruel wit with loving
jovial good-humor? or her vulgar [[music]] with the [[soul]] of the sorrow
songs?

merely a concrete test of the underlying principles [[principle]] of the great
republic is the negro problem, and the [[spiritual]] striving of the
freedmen’s sons [[son]] is the travail of souls [[soul]] whose burden is almost beyond
the measure of their [[strength]], but who bear it in the name of an
historic [[race]], in the name of this the [[land]] of their fathers’ fathers [[father]],
and in the name of [[human]] opportunity.

and now what i have briefly sketched in large outline let me on coming
pages tell again in many ways, with loving emphasis and deeper detail,
that [[men]] may listen to the striving in the souls [[soul]] of black folk.




ii.
of the dawn of freedom

careless seems the [[great]] avenger;
    history’s lessons but record
one death-grapple in the darkness
    ’twixt old systems [[system]] and the word;
truth forever on the scaffold,
    [[wrong]] forever on the [[throne]];
yet that scaffold sways the future,
    and behind the dim unknown
standeth [[god]] within the shadow
    keeping watch above his own.

the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the
color-line,—the relation of the darker to the lighter races [[race]] of [[men]] in
asia and [[africa]], in [[america]] and the islands of the sea. it was a phase
of this problem that caused the civil [[war]]; and however much they who
marched south and north in 1861 may have fixed on the technical points,
of union and local autonomy as a shibboleth, all nevertheless knew, as
we [[know]], that the [[question]] of negro [[slavery]] was the real cause of the
conflict. [[curious]] it was, too, how this deeper [[question]] ever forced
itself to the surface despite effort and disclaimer. no sooner had
northern armies [[army]] touched southern soil than this old [[question]], newly
guised, sprang from the [[earth]],—what shall be done with negroes?
peremptory [[military]] commands this way and that, could not [[answer]] the
query; the emancipation proclamation seemed but to broaden and
intensify the difficulties; and the [[war]] amendments made the negro
problems of to-day.

it is the aim of this essay to study the period of [[history]] from 1861 to
1872 so far as it relates to the american negro. in effect, this tale
of the dawn of [[freedom]] is an account of that [[government]] of [[men]] called
the freedmen’s bureau,—one of the most singular and interesting of the
attempts made by a [[great]] nation to grapple with vast problems of race
and social condition.

the [[war]] has naught to do with slaves [[slave]], cried congress, the president,
and the nation; and yet no sooner had the armies [[army]], east and west,
penetrated virginia and tennessee than fugitive slaves [[slave]] appeared within
their lines. they came at night, when the flickering camp-fires shone
like vast unsteady stars along the black horizon: old [[men]] and thin,
with gray and tufted hair; [[women]] with frightened [[eyes]], dragging
whimpering hungry [[children]]; [[men]] and girls, stalwart and gaunt,—a horde
of starving vagabonds, homeless, helpless, and pitiable, in their dark
distress. two methods of treating these newcomers seemed equally
logical to opposite sorts of minds [[mind]]. ben butler, in virginia, quickly
declared [[slave]] [[property]] contraband of [[war]], and put the fugitives to
work; while fremont, in missouri, declared the slaves [[slave]] [[free]] under
martial [[law]]. butler’s action was approved, but fremont’s was hastily
countermanded, and his successor, halleck, saw things differently.
“hereafter,” he commanded, “no slaves [[slave]] should be allowed to come into
your lines at all; if any come without your [[knowledge]], when owners call
for them deliver them.” such a policy was difficult to enforce; some of
the black refugees declared themselves freemen, others showed that
their masters had deserted them, and still others were captured with
forts and plantations. evidently, too, slaves [[slave]] were a source of strength
to the confederacy, and were being used as laborers and producers.
“they constitute a [[military]] resource,” wrote secretary cameron, late in
1861; “and being such, that they should not be turned over to the enemy
is too plain to discuss.” so gradually the tone of the [[army]] chiefs
changed; congress forbade the rendition of fugitives, and butler’s
“contrabands” were welcomed as [[military]] laborers. this complicated
rather than solved the problem, for now the scattering fugitives became
a steady stream, which flowed faster as the armies [[army]] marched.

then the long-headed [[man]] with care-chiselled face who sat in the white
house saw the inevitable, and emancipated the slaves [[slave]] of rebels on new
year’s, 1863. a month later congress called earnestly for the negro
soldiers whom the act of july, 1862, had half grudgingly allowed to
enlist. thus the barriers were levelled and the deed was done. the
stream of fugitives swelled to a flood, and anxious [[army]] officers kept
inquiring: “what must be done with slaves [[slave]], arriving almost daily? are
we to find food and shelter for [[women]] and [[children]]?”

it was a pierce of boston who pointed out the way, and thus became in a
sense the founder of the freedmen’s bureau. he was a firm friend of
secretary chase; and when, in 1861, the [[care]] of slaves [[slave]] and abandoned
lands devolved upon the treasury officials, pierce was specially
detailed from the ranks to study the conditions. first, he cared for
the refugees at fortress monroe; and then, after sherman had captured
hilton head, pierce was sent there to found his port [[royal]] experiment
of making [[free]] workingmen out of slaves [[slave]]. before his experiment was
barely started, however, the problem of the fugitives had assumed such
proportions that it was taken from the hands of the over-burdened
treasury department and given to the [[army]] officials. already centres of
massed freedmen were forming at fortress monroe, washington, new
orleans, vicksburg and corinth, columbus, ky., and cairo, ill., as well
as at port [[royal]]. [[army]] chaplains found here new and fruitful fields;
“superintendents of contrabands” multiplied, and some attempt at
systematic [[work]] was made by enlisting the able-bodied [[men]] and giving
work to the others.

then came the freedmen’s aid societies [[society]], born of the touching appeals
from pierce and from these other centres of distress. there was the
american missionary association, sprung from the amistad, and now
full-grown for [[work]]; the various [[church]] organizations, the national
freedmen’s relief association, the american freedmen’s union, the
western freedmen’s aid commission,—in all fifty or more active
organizations, which sent clothes, [[money]], school-books, and teachers
southward. all they did was needed, for the destitution of the freedmen
was often reported as “too appalling for [[belief]],” and the situation was
daily growing worse rather than [[better]].

and daily, too, it seemed more plain that this was no ordinary matter
of temporary relief, but a national crisis; for here loomed a labor
problem of vast dimensions. masses of negroes stood idle, or, if they
worked spasmodically, were never sure of [[pay]]; and if perchance they
received [[pay]], squandered the new thing thoughtlessly. in these and
other ways were camp-life and the new [[liberty]] demoralizing the
freedmen. the broader economic organization thus clearly demanded
sprang up here and there as accident and local conditions determined.
here it was that pierce’s port [[royal]] plan of leased plantations and
guided workmen pointed out the rough way. in washington the military
governor, at the urgent appeal of the superintendent, opened
confiscated estates to the cultivation of the fugitives, and there in
the shadow of the dome gathered black farm villages. general dix gave
over estates to the freedmen of fortress monroe, and so on, south and
west. the [[government]] and benevolent societies [[society]] furnished the means of
cultivation, and the negro turned again slowly to [[work]]. the systems [[system]] of
control, thus started, rapidly grew, here and there, into strange
little governments [[government]], like that of general banks in louisiana, with its
ninety thousand black subjects [[subject]], its fifty thousand guided laborers, and
its annual budget of one hundred thousand dollars and more. it made out
four thousand pay-rolls a year, registered all freedmen, inquired into
grievances and redressed them, laid and collected taxes, and
established a [[system]] of [[public]] schools. so, too, colonel eaton, the
superintendent of tennessee and arkansas, ruled over one hundred
thousand freedmen, leased and cultivated seven thousand acres of cotton
land, and fed ten thousand paupers a year. in south carolina was
general saxton, with his deep interest in black folk. he succeeded
pierce and the treasury officials, and sold forfeited estates, leased
abandoned plantations, encouraged schools, and received from sherman,
after that terribly picturesque march to the sea, thousands of the
wretched camp followers.

three characteristic things one might have seen in sherman’s raid
through georgia, which threw the new situation in shadowy relief: the
conqueror, the conquered, and the negro. some see all significance in
the grim front of the destroyer, and some in the bitter sufferers of
the lost cause. but to me neither soldier nor fugitive speaks with so
deep a meaning as that dark [[human]] cloud that clung like remorse on the
rear of those swift columns, swelling at times [[time]] to half their size,
almost engulfing and choking them. in [[vain]] were they ordered back, in
vain were bridges hewn from beneath their feet; on they trudged and
writhed and surged, until they rolled into savannah, a starved and
naked horde of tens of thousands. there too came the characteristic
military remedy: “the islands from charleston south, the abandoned
rice-fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and
the [[country]] bordering the st. john’s river, florida, are reserved and
set apart for the settlement of negroes now made [[free]] by act of [[war]].”
so [[read]] the celebrated “field-order number fifteen.”

all these experiments, orders, and systems [[system]] were bound to attract and
perplex the [[government]] and the nation. directly after the emancipation
proclamation, representative eliot had introduced a bill creating a
bureau of emancipation; but it was never reported. the following june a
committee of inquiry, appointed by the secretary of [[war]], reported in
favor of a temporary bureau for the “improvement, protection, and
employment of refugee freedmen,” on much the same lines as were
afterwards followed. petitions came in to president lincoln from
distinguished [[citizens]] and organizations, strongly urging a
comprehensive and unified plan of dealing with the freedmen, under a
bureau which should be “charged with the study of plans and execution
of measures for easily guiding, and in every way judiciously and
humanely aiding, the passage of our emancipated and yet to be
emancipated blacks from the old condition of forced labor to their new
state of voluntary industry.”

some half-hearted steps were taken to accomplish this, in part, by
putting the whole matter again in charge of the special treasury
agents. laws [[law]] of 1863 and 1864 directed them to take charge of and lease
abandoned lands [[land]] for periods not exceeding twelve months, and to
“provide in such leases, or otherwise, for the employment and general
welfare” of the freedmen. most of the [[army]] officers greeted this as a
welcome relief from perplexing “negro affairs,” and secretary
fessenden, july 29, 1864, issued an excellent [[system]] of regulations,
which were afterward closely followed by general howard. under treasury
agents, large quantities of [[land]] were leased in the mississippi valley,
and many negroes were employed; but in august, 1864, the new
regulations were suspended for reasons [[reason]] of “public policy,” and the army
was again in control.

meanwhile congress had turned its attention to the [[subject]]; and in
march the house passed a bill by a majority of two establishing a
bureau for freedmen in the [[war]] department. charles sumner, who had
charge of the bill in the senate, argued that freedmen and abandoned
lands ought to be under the same department, and reported a substitute
for the house bill attaching the bureau to the treasury department.
this bill passed, but too late for action by the house. the debates
wandered over the whole policy of the administration and the general
question of [[slavery]], without touching very closely the specific merits
of the measure in hand. then the national election took place; and the
administration, with a vote of renewed confidence from the [[country]],
addressed itself to the matter more seriously. a conference between the
two branches of congress agreed upon a carefully drawn measure which
contained the [[chief]] provisions of sumner’s bill, but made the proposed
organization a department independent of both the [[war]] and the treasury
officials. the bill was conservative, giving the new department
“general superintendence of all freedmen.” its [[purpose]] was to
“establish regulations” for them, [[protect]] them, lease them lands [[land]],
adjust their wages, and appear in civil and [[military]] courts as their
“next friend.” there were many limitations attached to the powers [[power]] thus
granted, and the organization was made permanent. nevertheless, the
senate defeated the bill, and a new conference committee was appointed.
this committee reported a new bill, february 28, which was whirled
through just as the session closed, and became the act of 1865
establishing in the [[war]] department a “bureau of refugees, freedmen, and
abandoned lands [[land]].”

this [[last]] compromise was a hasty bit of legislation, vague and
uncertain in outline. a bureau was created, “to continue during the
present [[war]] of rebellion, and for one year thereafter,” to which was
given “the supervision and management of all abandoned lands [[land]] and the
control of all subjects [[subject]] relating to refugees and freedmen,” under “such
rules and regulations as may be presented by the head of the bureau and
approved by the president.” a commissioner, appointed by the president
and senate, was to control the bureau, with an office [[force]] not
exceeding ten clerks. the president might also appoint assistant
commissioners in the seceded states, and to all these offices military
officials might be detailed at regular [[pay]]. the secretary of [[war]] could
issue rations, clothing, and fuel to the destitute, and all abandoned
property was placed in the hands of the bureau for eventual lease and
sale to ex-slaves in forty-acre parcels.

thus did the [[united]] states [[government]] definitely assume charge of the
emancipated negro as the ward of the nation. it was a tremendous
undertaking. here at a stroke of the pen was erected a [[government]] of
millions of [[men]],—and not ordinary [[men]] either, but black [[men]] emasculated
by a peculiarly complete [[system]] of [[slavery]], centuries old; and now,
suddenly, violently, they come into a new birthright, at a [[time]] of war
and passion, in the midst of the stricken and embittered [[population]] of
their former masters. any [[man]] might well have hesitated to assume
charge of such a [[work]], with vast responsibilities, indefinite powers [[power]],
and limited resources. probably no one but a soldier would have
answered such a call promptly; and, indeed, no one but a soldier could
be called, for congress had appropriated no [[money]] for salaries and
expenses.

less than a month after the weary emancipator passed to his rest, his
successor assigned major-gen. oliver o. howard to [[duty]] as commissioner
of the new bureau. he was a maine [[man]], then only thirty-five years of
age. he had marched with sherman to the sea, had fought well at
gettysburg, and but the year before had been assigned to the command of
the department of tennessee. an honest [[man]], with too much [[faith]] in
human [[nature]], little aptitude for [[business]] and intricate detail, he had
had large opportunity of becoming acquainted at first hand with much of
the [[work]] before him. and of that [[work]] it has been truly said that “no
approximately [[correct]] [[history]] of [[civilization]] can ever be written which
does not throw out in bold relief, as one of the [[great]] landmarks of
political and social [[progress]], the organization and administration of
the freedmen’s bureau.”

on may 12, 1865, howard was appointed; and he assumed the duties [[duty]] of his
office promptly on the 15th, and began examining the field of [[work]]. a
curious mess he looked upon: little despotisms, communistic
experiments, [[slavery]], peonage, [[business]] speculations, organized
charity, unorganized almsgiving,—all reeling on under the guise of
helping the freedmen, and all enshrined in the smoke and [[blood]] of the
war and the cursing and [[silence]] of angry [[men]]. on may 19 the new
government—for a [[government]] it really was—issued its [[constitution]];
commissioners were to be appointed in each of the seceded states, who
were to take charge of “all subjects [[subject]] relating to refugees and
freedmen,” and all relief and rations were to be given by their consent
alone. the bureau invited continued cooperation with benevolent
societies, and declared: “it will be the object of all commissioners to
introduce practicable systems [[system]] of compensated labor,” and to establish
schools. forthwith nine assistant commissioners were appointed. they
were to hasten to their fields of [[work]]; seek gradually to close relief
establishments, and make the destitute self-supporting; act as courts
of [[law]] where there were no courts, or where negroes were not recognized
in them as [[free]]; establish the institution of [[marriage]] among ex-slaves,
and keep records; see that freedmen were [[free]] to choose their
employers, and [[help]] in making [[fair]] contracts for them; and finally, the
circular said: “simple [[good]] [[faith]], for which we [[hope]] on all hands for
those concerned in the passing away of [[slavery]], will especially relieve
the assistant commissioners in the discharge of their duties [[duty]] toward the
freedmen, as well as promote the general welfare.”

no sooner was the [[work]] thus started, and the general [[system]] and local
organization in some measure begun, than two grave difficulties
appeared which changed largely the theory and outcome of bureau [[work]].
first, there were the abandoned lands [[land]] of the south. it had long been
the more or less definitely expressed theory of the north that all the
chief problems of emancipation might be settled by establishing the
slaves on the forfeited lands [[land]] of their masters,—a sort of poetic
justice, said some. but this poetry done into solemn prose meant either
wholesale confiscation of private [[property]] in the south, or vast
appropriations. now congress had not appropriated a cent, and no sooner
did the proclamations of general amnesty appear than the eight hundred
thousand acres of abandoned lands [[land]] in the hands of the freedmen’s bureau
melted quickly away. the second difficulty lay in perfecting the local
organization of the bureau throughout the wide field of [[work]]. making a
new machine and sending out officials of duly ascertained fitness for a
great [[work]] of social reform is no child’s task; but this task was even
harder, for a new central organization had to be fitted on a
heterogeneous and confused but already existing [[system]] of relief and
control of ex-slaves; and the agents available for this [[work]] must be
sought for in an [[army]] still busy with [[war]] operations,—men in the very
nature of the case ill fitted for delicate social [[work]],—or among the
questionable camp followers of an invading host. thus, after a year’s
work, vigorously as it was pushed, the problem looked even more
difficult to grasp and solve than at the beginning. nevertheless, three
things that year’s [[work]] did, well worth the doing: it relieved a vast
amount of physical suffering; it transported seven thousand fugitives
from congested centres back to the farm; and, [[best]] of all, it
inaugurated the crusade of the new [[england]] schoolma’am.

the annals of this ninth crusade are yet to be written,—the tale of a
mission that seemed to our [[age]] far more quixotic than the quest of st.
louis seemed to his. behind the mists of ruin and rapine waved the
calico dresses of [[women]] who dared, and after the hoarse mouthings of
the field guns rang the rhythm of the alphabet. [[rich]] and [[poor]] they
were, serious and [[curious]]. bereaved now of a [[father]], now of a [[brother]],
now of more than these, they came seeking a [[life]] [[work]] in planting new
england schoolhouses among the [[white]] and black of the south. they did
their [[work]] well. in that first year they taught one hundred thousand
souls, and more.

evidently, congress must soon legislate again on the hastily organized
bureau, which had so quickly grown into wide significance and vast
possibilities. an institution such as that was well-nigh as difficult
to end as to begin. early in 1866 congress took up the matter, when
senator trumbull, of illinois, introduced a bill to extend the bureau
and enlarge its powers [[power]]. this measure received, at the hands of
congress, far more thorough discussion and attention than its
predecessor. the [[war]] cloud had thinned enough to allow a clearer
conception of the [[work]] of emancipation. the champions of the bill
argued that the strengthening of the freedmen’s bureau was still a
military necessity; that it was needed for the proper carrying out of
the thirteenth amendment, and was a [[work]] of sheer [[justice]] to the
ex-slave, at a trifling cost to the [[government]]. the opponents of the
measure declared that the [[war]] was over, and the necessity for war
measures [[past]]; that the bureau, by [[reason]] of its extraordinary powers [[power]],
was clearly unconstitutional in [[time]] of [[peace]], and was destined to
irritate the south and pauperize the freedmen, at a final cost of
possibly hundreds of millions. these two arguments were unanswered, and
indeed unanswerable: the one that the extraordinary powers [[power]] of the
bureau threatened the civil rights [[right]] of all [[citizens]]; and the other that
the [[government]] must have [[power]] to do what manifestly must be done, and
that [[present]] abandonment of the freedmen meant their practical
reenslavement. the bill which finally passed enlarged and made
permanent the freedmen’s bureau. it was promptly vetoed by president
johnson as “unconstitutional,” “unnecessary,” and “extrajudicial,” and
failed of passage over the veto. meantime, however, the breach between
congress and the president began to broaden, and a modified form of the
lost bill was finally passed over the president’s second veto, july 16.

the act of 1866 gave the freedmen’s bureau its final form,—the form by
which it will be known to [[posterity]] and judged of [[men]]. it extended the
existence of the bureau to july, 1868; it authorized additional
assistant commissioners, the retention of [[army]] officers mustered out of
regular service, the sale of [[certain]] forfeited lands [[land]] to freedmen on
nominal terms, the sale of confederate [[public]] [[property]] for negro
schools, and a wider field of judicial interpretation and cognizance.
the [[government]] of the unreconstructed south was thus put very largely
in the hands of the freedmen’s bureau, especially as in many cases the
departmental [[military]] commander was now made also assistant
commissioner. it was thus that the freedmen’s bureau became a
full-fledged [[government]] of [[men]]. it made laws [[law]], executed them and
interpreted them; it laid and collected taxes, defined and punished
crime, maintained and used [[military]] [[force]], and dictated such measures
as it [[thought]] necessary and proper for the accomplishment of its varied
ends. naturally, all these powers [[power]] were not exercised continuously nor
to their fullest extent; and yet, as general howard has said, “scarcely
any [[subject]] that has to be legislated upon in civil [[society]] failed, at
one [[time]] or another, to demand the action of this singular bureau.”

to [[understand]] and criticise intelligently so vast a [[work]], one must not
forget an instant the drift of things in the later sixties. lee had
surrendered, lincoln was [[dead]], and johnson and congress were at
loggerheads; the thirteenth amendment was adopted, the fourteenth
pending, and the fifteenth declared in [[force]] in 1870. guerrilla
raiding, the ever-present flickering after-flame of [[war]], was spending
its forces [[force]] against the negroes, and all the southern [[land]] was awakening
as from some wild [[dream]] to [[poverty]] and social [[revolution]]. in a [[time]] of
perfect calm, amid willing neighbors and streaming [[wealth]], the social
uplifting of four million slaves [[slave]] to an assured and self-sustaining
place in the [[body]] [[politic]] and economic would have been a herculean
task; but when to the inherent difficulties of so delicate and nice a
social operation were added the spite and hate of conflict, the hell of
war; when suspicion and [[cruelty]] were rife, and gaunt [[hunger]] wept beside
bereavement,—in such a case, the [[work]] of any instrument of social
regeneration was in large part foredoomed to failure. the very name of
the bureau stood for a thing in the south which for two centuries and
better [[men]] had refused even to argue,—that [[life]] amid [[free]] negroes was
simply unthinkable, the maddest of experiments.

the agents that the bureau could command varied all the way from
unselfish philanthropists to narrow-minded busybodies and thieves; and
even though it be true that the average was far [[better]] than the worst,
it was the occasional fly that helped spoil the ointment.

then amid all crouched the freed [[slave]], bewildered between friend and
foe. he had emerged from [[slavery]],—not the worst [[slavery]] in the [[world]],
not a [[slavery]] that made all [[life]] unbearable, rather a [[slavery]] that had
here and there something of kindliness, fidelity, and [[happiness]],—but
withal [[slavery]], which, so far as [[human]] aspiration and desert were
concerned, classed the black [[man]] and the ox together. and the negro
knew full well that, whatever their deeper convictions may have been,
southern [[men]] had fought with desperate energy to perpetuate this
slavery under which the black masses, with half-articulate [[thought]], had
writhed and shivered. they welcomed [[freedom]] with a cry. they shrank
from the master who still strove for their chains; they fled to the
friends that had freed them, even though those [[friends]] stood ready to
use them as a club for driving the recalcitrant south back into
loyalty. so the cleft between the [[white]] and black south grew. idle to
say it never should have been; it was as inevitable as its results were
pitiable. curiously incongruous elements were left arrayed against each
other,—the north, the [[government]], the carpet-bagger, and the [[slave]],
here; and there, all the south that was [[white]], whether gentleman or
vagabond, honest [[man]] or rascal, lawless murderer or martyr to [[duty]].

thus it is doubly difficult to write of this period calmly, so intense
was the feeling, so mighty the [[human]] [[passions]] that swayed and blinded
men. amid it all, two figures ever stand to typify that day to coming
ages,—the one, a gray-haired gentleman, whose fathers [[father]] had quit
themselves like [[men]], whose sons [[son]] lay in nameless graves; who bowed to
the [[evil]] of [[slavery]] because its abolition threatened untold ill to all;
who stood at [[last]], in the evening of [[life]], a blighted, ruined form,
with hate in his [[eyes]];—and the other, a form hovering dark and
mother-like, her awful face black with the mists of centuries, had
aforetime quailed at that [[white]] master’s command, had bent in [[love]] over
the cradles of his sons [[son]] and daughters [[daughter]], and closed in [[death]] the sunken
eyes of his [[wife]],—aye, too, at his behest had laid herself low to his
lust, and borne a tawny man-child to the [[world]], only to see her dark
boy’s limbs scattered to the winds by midnight marauders riding after
“damned niggers.” these were the saddest sights of that woful day; and
no [[man]] clasped the hands of these two passing figures of the
present-past; but, hating, they went to their long [[home]], and, hating,
their children’s [[children]] [[live]] today.

here, then, was the field of [[work]] for the freedmen’s bureau; and since,
with some hesitation, it was continued by the act of 1868 until 1869,
let us look upon four years of its [[work]] as a whole. there were, in
1868, nine hundred bureau officials scattered from washington to texas,
ruling, directly and indirectly, many millions of [[men]]. the deeds of
these rulers fall mainly under seven heads: the relief of physical
suffering, the overseeing of the beginnings of [[free]] labor, the buying
and selling of [[land]], the establishment of schools, the paying of
bounties, the administration of [[justice]], and the financiering of all
these activities.

up to june, 1869, over half a million patients had been treated by
bureau physicians and surgeons, and sixty hospitals and asylums had
been in operation. in fifty months twenty-one million [[free]] rations were
distributed at a cost of over four million dollars. next came the
difficult [[question]] of labor. first, thirty thousand black [[men]] were
transported from the refuges and relief stations back to the farms,
back to the critical [[trial]] of a new way of working. plain instructions
went out from washington: the laborers must be [[free]] to choose their
employers, no fixed rate of wages was prescribed, and there was to be
no peonage or forced labor. so far, so [[good]]; but where local agents
differed _toto cælo_ in capacity and [[character]], where the _personnel_
was continually changing, the outcome was necessarily varied. the
largest element of [[success]] lay in the [[fact]] that the majority of the
freedmen were willing, even eager, to [[work]]. so labor contracts were
written,—fifty thousand in a [[single]] [[state]],—laborers advised, wages
guaranteed, and employers supplied. in [[truth]], the organization became a
vast labor bureau,—not [[perfect]], indeed, notably defective here and
there, but on the whole successful beyond the dreams [[dream]] of thoughtful [[men]].
the two [[great]] obstacles which confronted the officials were the tyrant
and the idler,—the slaveholder who was determined to perpetuate slavery
under another name; and, the freedman who regarded [[freedom]] as perpetual
rest,—the [[devil]] and the deep sea.

in the [[work]] of establishing the negroes as peasant proprietors, the
bureau was from the first handicapped and at [[last]] absolutely checked.
something was done, and larger things were planned; abandoned lands
were leased so long as they remained in the hands of the bureau, and a
total [[revenue]] of nearly half a million dollars derived from black
tenants. some other lands [[land]] to which the nation had gained title were
sold on easy terms, and [[public]] lands [[land]] were opened for settlement to the
very few freedmen who had tools and [[capital]]. but the vision of “forty
acres and a mule’—the righteous and reasonable [[ambition]] to become a
landholder, which the nation had all but categorically promised the
freedmen—was destined in most cases to bitter disappointment. and those
men of marvellous hindsight who are today seeking to preach the negro
back to the [[present]] peonage of the soil [[know]] well, or ought to [[know]],
that the opportunity of binding the negro peasant willingly to the soil
was lost on that day when the commissioner of the freedmen’s bureau had
to go to south carolina and tell the weeping freedmen, after their
years of toil, that their [[land]] was not theirs, that there was a
mistake—somewhere. if by 1874 the georgia negro alone owned three
hundred and fifty thousand acres of [[land]], it was by grace of his thrift
rather than by bounty of the [[government]].

the [[greatest]] [[success]] of the freedmen’s bureau lay in the planting of
the [[free]] school among negroes, and the [[idea]] of [[free]] elementary
education among all classes in the south. it not only called the
school-mistresses through the benevolent agencies and built them
schoolhouses, but it helped discover and support such [[apostles]] of human
culture as edmund ware, samuel armstrong, and erastus cravath. the
opposition to negro [[education]] in the south was at first bitter, and
showed itself in ashes, insult, and [[blood]]; for the south believed an
educated negro to be a dangerous negro. and the south was not wholly
wrong; for [[education]] among all kinds [[kind]] of [[men]] always has had, and always
will have, an element of danger and [[revolution]], of dissatisfaction and
discontent. nevertheless, [[men]] strive to [[know]]. perhaps some inkling of
this paradox, even in the unquiet days of the bureau, helped the
bayonets allay an opposition to [[human]] training which still to-day lies
smouldering in the south, but not flaming. fisk, atlanta, howard, and
hampton were founded in these days, and six million dollars were
expended for educational [[work]], seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars
of which the freedmen themselves gave of their [[poverty]].

such contributions, together with the buying of [[land]] and various other
enterprises, showed that the ex-slave was handling some [[free]] capital
already. the [[chief]] initial source of this was labor in the [[army]], and
his [[pay]] and bounty as a soldier. payments to negro soldiers were at
first complicated by the ignorance of the recipients, and the [[fact]] that
the quotas of colored regiments from northern states were largely
filled by recruits from the south, unknown to their fellow soldiers.
consequently, payments were accompanied by such frauds that congress,
by joint resolution in 1867, put the whole matter in the hands of the
freedmen’s bureau. in two years six million dollars was thus
distributed to five thousand claimants, and in the end the sum exceeded
eight million dollars. even in this [[system]] fraud was frequent; but
still the [[work]] put needed [[capital]] in the hands of practical paupers,
and some, at least, was well spent.

the most perplexing and least successful part of the bureau’s [[work]] lay
in the exercise of its judicial functions. the regular bureau court
consisted of one representative of the employer, one of the negro, and
one of the bureau. if the bureau could have maintained a perfectly
judicial attitude, this arrangement would have been ideal, and must in
time have gained confidence; but the [[nature]] of its other activities and
the [[character]] of its _personnel_ prejudiced the bureau in favor of the
black litigants, and [[led]] without [[doubt]] to much [[injustice]] and annoyance.
on the other hand, to leave the negro in the hands of southern courts
was impossible. in a distracted [[land]] where [[slavery]] had hardly fallen,
to keep the [[strong]] from wanton [[abuse]] of the [[weak]], and the [[weak]] from
gloating insolently over the half-shorn [[strength]] of the [[strong]], was a
thankless, hopeless task. the former masters of the [[land]] were
peremptorily ordered about, seized, and imprisoned, and punished over
and again, with scant courtesy from [[army]] officers. the former slaves
were intimidated, beaten, raped, and butchered by angry and revengeful
men. bureau courts tended to become centres simply for punishing
whites, while the regular civil courts tended to become solely
institutions for perpetuating the [[slavery]] of blacks. almost every law
and method ingenuity could devise was employed by the legislatures to
reduce the negroes to serfdom,—to make them the slaves [[slave]] of the [[state]], if
not of [[individual]] owners; while the bureau officials too often were
found striving to put the “bottom rail on top,” and gave the freedmen a
power and independence which they could not yet use. it is all well
enough for us of another [[generation]] to wax [[wise]] with [[advice]] to those
who bore the burden in the heat of the day. it is full easy now to see
that the [[man]] who lost [[home]], [[fortune]], and [[family]] at a stroke, and saw
his [[land]] ruled by “mules and niggers,” was really benefited by the
passing of [[slavery]]. it is not difficult now to say to the young
freedman, cheated and cuffed about who has seen his father’s head
beaten to a jelly and his own [[mother]] namelessly assaulted, that the
meek shall inherit the [[earth]]. above all, nothing is more convenient
than to heap on the freedmen’s bureau all the evils [[evil]] of that [[evil]] day,
and damn it utterly for every mistake and blunder that was made.

all this is easy, but it is neither sensible nor just. someone had
blundered, but that was long before oliver howard was born; there was
criminal aggression and heedless neglect, but without some [[system]] of
control there would have been far more than there was. had that control
been from within, the negro would have been re-enslaved, to all intents
and purposes [[purpose]]. coming as the control did from without, [[perfect]] [[men]] and
methods would have bettered all things; and even with imperfect agents
and questionable methods, the [[work]] accomplished was not undeserving of
commendation.

such was the dawn of [[freedom]]; such was the [[work]] of the freedmen’s
bureau, which, summed up in brief, may be epitomized thus: for some
fifteen million dollars, beside the sums spent before 1865, and the
dole of benevolent societies [[society]], this bureau set going a [[system]] of free
labor, established a beginning of peasant proprietorship, secured the
recognition of black freedmen before courts of [[law]], and founded the
free [[common]] school in the south. on the other hand, it failed to begin
the establishment of good-will between ex-masters and freedmen, to
guard its [[work]] wholly from paternalistic methods which discouraged
self-reliance, and to carry out to any considerable extent its implied
promises to furnish the freedmen with [[land]]. its successes were the
result of hard [[work]], supplemented by the aid of philanthropists and the
eager striving of black [[men]]. its failures were the result of [[bad]] local
agents, the inherent difficulties of the [[work]], and national neglect.

such an institution, from its wide powers [[power]], [[great]] responsibilities,
large control of moneys, and generally conspicuous position, was
naturally open to repeated and bitter attack. it sustained a searching
congressional investigation at the instance of fernando wood in 1870.
its archives and few remaining functions were with blunt discourtesy
transferred from howard’s control, in his absence, to the supervision
of secretary of [[war]] belknap in 1872, on the secretary’s recommendation.
finally, in consequence of grave intimations of wrong-doing made by the
secretary and his subordinates, general howard was court-martialed in
1874. in both of these trials the commissioner of the freedmen’s bureau
was officially exonerated from any wilful misdoing, and his work
commended. nevertheless, many unpleasant things were brought to
light,—the methods of transacting the [[business]] of the bureau were
faulty; several cases of defalcation were proved, and other frauds
strongly suspected; there were some [[business]] transactions which savored
of dangerous speculation, if not dishonesty; and around it all lay the
smirch of the freedmen’s bank.

morally and practically, the freedmen’s bank was part of the freedmen’s
bureau, although it had no legal connection with it. with the prestige
of the [[government]] back of it, and a directing board of unusual
respectability and national [[reputation]], this banking institution had
made a remarkable start in the [[development]] of that thrift among black
folk which [[slavery]] had kept them from knowing. then in one [[sad]] day came
the crash,—all the hard-earned dollars of the freedmen disappeared; but
that was the least of the loss,—all the [[faith]] in saving went too, and
much of the [[faith]] in [[men]]; and that was a loss that a nation which
to-day sneers at negro shiftlessness has never yet made [[good]]. not even
ten additional years of [[slavery]] could have done so much to throttle the
thrift of the freedmen as the mismanagement and bankruptcy of the
series of savings banks chartered by the nation for their especial aid.
where all the blame should rest, it is hard to say; whether the bureau
and the bank died chiefly by [[reason]] of the blows of its selfish friends
or the dark machinations of its foes, perhaps even [[time]] will never
reveal, for here lies [[lie]] unwritten [[history]].

of the foes without the bureau, the bitterest were those who attacked
not so much its conduct or policy under the [[law]] as the necessity for
any such institution at all. such attacks came primarily from the
border states and the south; and they were summed up by senator davis,
of kentucky, when he moved to entitle the act of 1866 a bill “to
promote strife and conflict between the [[white]] and black races… by a
grant of unconstitutional [[power]].” the argument gathered tremendous
strength south and north; but its very [[strength]] was its weakness. for,
argued the plain common-sense of the nation, if it is unconstitutional,
unpractical, and futile for the nation to stand guardian over its
helpless wards, then there is left but one alternative,—to make those
wards their own guardians by arming them with the ballot. moreover, the
path of the practical politician pointed the same way; for, argued this
opportunist, if we cannot peacefully reconstruct the south with white
votes, we certainly can with black votes. so [[justice]] and [[force]] joined
hands.

the alternative thus offered the nation was not between full and
restricted negro suffrage; else every sensible [[man]], black and [[white]],
would easily have chosen the latter. it was rather a [[choice]] between
suffrage and [[slavery]], after endless [[blood]] and gold had flowed to sweep
human bondage away. not a [[single]] southern legislature stood ready to
admit a negro, under any conditions, to the polls; not a single
southern legislature believed [[free]] negro labor was possible without a
system of restrictions that took all its [[freedom]] away; there was
scarcely a [[white]] [[man]] in the south who did not honestly regard
emancipation as a crime, and its practical nullification as a [[duty]]. in
such a situation, the granting of the ballot to the black [[man]] was a
necessity, the very least a guilty nation could grant a wronged [[race]],
and the only method of compelling the south to accept the results of
the [[war]]. thus negro suffrage ended a civil [[war]] by beginning a race
feud. and some [[felt]] gratitude toward the [[race]] thus sacrificed in its
swaddling clothes on the altar of national integrity; and some [[felt]] and
feel only indifference and contempt.

had [[political]] exigencies been less pressing, the opposition to
government guardianship of negroes less bitter, and the attachment to
the [[slave]] [[system]] less [[strong]], the social seer can well imagine a far
better policy,—a permanent freedmen’s bureau, with a national [[system]] of
negro schools; a carefully supervised employment and labor office; a
system of [[impartial]] protection before the regular courts; and such
institutions for social betterment as savings-banks, [[land]] and building
associations, and social settlements. all this vast expenditure of
money and brains might have formed a [[great]] school of prospective
citizenship, and solved in a way we have not yet solved the most
perplexing and persistent of the negro problems.

that such an institution was unthinkable in 1870 was due in part to
certain acts of the freedmen’s bureau itself. it came to regard its
work as merely temporary, and negro suffrage as a final [[answer]] to all
present perplexities. the [[political]] [[ambition]] of many of its agents and
_protégés_ [[led]] it far afield into questionable activities, until the
south, nursing its own deep prejudices, came easily to ignore all the
good deeds of the bureau and hate its very name with [[perfect]] [[hatred]]. so
the freedmen’s bureau died, and its child was the fifteenth amendment.

the passing of a [[great]] [[human]] institution before its [[work]] is done, like
the untimely passing of a [[single]] [[soul]], but leaves a legacy of striving
for other [[men]]. the legacy of the freedmen’s bureau is the heavy
heritage of this [[generation]]. to-day, when new and vaster problems are
destined to strain every fibre of the national [[mind]] and [[soul]], would it
not be well to count this legacy honestly and carefully? for this much
all [[men]] [[know]]: despite compromise, [[war]], and struggle, the negro is not
free. in the backwoods of the gulf states, for miles and miles, he may
not leave the plantation of his birth; in well-nigh the whole rural
south the black farmers [[farmer]] are peons, bound by [[law]] and custom to an
economic [[slavery]], from which the only escape is [[death]] or the
penitentiary. in the most cultured sections and cities [[city]] of the south the
negroes are a segregated servile caste, with restricted rights [[right]] and
privileges. before the courts, both in [[law]] and custom, they stand on a
different and peculiar basis. [[taxation]] without representation is the
rule of their [[political]] [[life]]. and the result of all this is, and in
nature must have been, lawlessness and crime. that is the large legacy
of the freedmen’s bureau, the [[work]] it did not do because it could not.

i have seen a [[land]] [[right]] merry with the sun, where [[children]] sing, and
rolling hills [[lie]] like passioned [[women]] wanton with harvest. and there
in the king’s highways sat and sits a figure veiled and bowed, by which
the traveller’s footsteps hasten as they go. on the tainted air broods
fear. three centuries’ [[thought]] has been the raising and unveiling of
that bowed [[human]] [[heart]], and now behold a century new for the [[duty]] and
the deed. the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the
color-line.

easily the most striking thing in the [[history]] of the american negro
since 1876 is the ascendancy of mr. booker t. washington. it began at
the [[time]] when [[war]] memories and ideals were rapidly passing; a day of
astonishing commercial [[development]] was dawning; a sense of [[doubt]] and
hesitation overtook the freedmen’s sons [[son]],—then it was that his leading
began. mr. washington came, with a simple definite programme, at the
psychological moment when the nation was a little ashamed of having
bestowed so much sentiment on negroes, and was concentrating its
energies on dollars. his programme of industrial [[education]],
conciliation of the south, and submission and [[silence]] as to civil and
political rights [[right]], was not wholly original; the [[free]] negroes from 1830
up to war-time had striven to build industrial schools, and the
american missionary association had from the first taught various
trades; and price and others had sought a way of honorable alliance
with the [[best]] of the southerners. but mr. washington first indissolubly
linked these things; he put enthusiasm, unlimited energy, and perfect
faith into his programme, and changed it from a by-path into a
veritable way of [[life]]. and the tale of the methods by which he did this
is a fascinating study of [[human]] [[life]].

it startled the nation to hear a negro advocating such a programme
after many decades of bitter complaint; it startled and won the
applause of the south, it interested and won the admiration of the
north; and after a confused murmur of [[protest]], it silenced if it did
not convert the negroes themselves.

to gain the sympathy and cooperation of the various elements comprising
the [[white]] south was mr. washington’s first task; and this, at the time
tuskegee was founded, seemed, for a black [[man]], well-nigh impossible.
and yet ten years later it was done in the word spoken at atlanta: “in
all things purely social we can be as separate as the five fingers, and
yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual [[progress]].” this
“atlanta compromise” is by all odds the most notable thing in mr.
washington’s [[career]]. the south interpreted it in different ways: the
radicals received it as a complete [[surrender]] of the demand for civil
and [[political]] equality; the conservatives, as a generously conceived
working basis for mutual understanding. so both approved it, and to-day
its author is certainly the most distinguished southerner since
jefferson davis, and the one with the largest personal following.

next to this achievement comes mr. washington’s [[work]] in gaining place
and consideration in the north. others less shrewd and tactful had
formerly essayed to sit on these two stools and had fallen between
them; but as mr. washington knew the [[heart]] of the south from birth and
training, so by singular insight he intuitively grasped the spirit of
the [[age]] which was dominating the north. and so thoroughly did he learn
the [[speech]] and [[thought]] of triumphant commercialism, and the ideals of
material [[prosperity]], that the picture of a lone black boy poring over a
french grammar amid the weeds and dirt of a neglected [[home]] soon seemed
to him the acme of absurdities. one wonders what [[socrates]] and st.
francis of assisi would say to this.

and yet this very singleness of vision and thorough oneness with his
age is a mark of the successful [[man]]. it is as though [[nature]] must needs
make [[men]] narrow in order to give them [[force]]. so mr. washington’s cult
has gained unquestioning followers, his [[work]] has wonderfully prospered,
his [[friends]] are legion, and his enemies [[enemy]] are confounded. to-day he
stands as the one recognized spokesman of his ten million fellows, and
one of the most notable figures in a nation of seventy millions. one
hesitates, therefore, to criticise a [[life]] which, beginning with so
little, has done so much. and yet the [[time]] is come when one may speak
in all sincerity and utter courtesy of the mistakes and shortcomings of
mr. washington’s [[career]], as well as of his triumphs, without being
thought captious or envious, and without forgetting that it is easier
to do ill than well in the [[world]].

the criticism that has hitherto met mr. washington has not always been
of this broad [[character]]. in the south especially has he had to walk
warily to avoid the harshest judgments [[judgment]],—and naturally so, for he is
dealing with the one [[subject]] of deepest sensitiveness to that section.
twice—once when at the chicago celebration of the spanish-american war
he alluded to the color-prejudice that is “eating away the vitals of
the south,” and once when he dined with president roosevelt—has the
resulting southern criticism been [[violent]] enough to threaten seriously
his popularity. in the north the feeling has several times [[time]] forced
itself into words, that mr. washington’s counsels of submission
overlooked [[certain]] elements of true manhood, and that his educational
programme was unnecessarily narrow. usually, however, such criticism
has not found open expression, although, too, the [[spiritual]] sons [[son]] of the
abolitionists have not been prepared to acknowledge that the schools
founded before tuskegee, by [[men]] of broad ideals and self-sacrificing
spirit, were wholly failures or worthy of ridicule. while, then,
criticism has not failed to [[follow]] mr. washington, yet the prevailing
public [[opinion]] of the [[land]] has been but too willing to deliver the
solution of a wearisome problem into his hands, and say, “if that is
all you and your [[race]] ask, take it.”

among his own [[people]], however, mr. washington has encountered the
strongest and most lasting opposition, amounting at times [[time]] to
bitterness, and even today continuing [[strong]] and insistent even though
largely silenced in outward expression by the [[public]] [[opinion]] of the
nation. some of this opposition is, of course, mere envy; the
disappointment of displaced demagogues and the spite of narrow minds [[mind]].
but aside from this, there is among educated and thoughtful colored men
in all parts of the [[land]] a feeling of deep regret, [[sorrow]], and
apprehension at the wide currency and ascendancy which some of mr.
washington’s theories have gained. these same [[men]] [[admire]] his sincerity
of [[purpose]], and are willing to [[forgive]] much to honest endeavor which is
doing something worth the doing. they cooperate with mr. washington as
far as they conscientiously can; and, indeed, it is no ordinary tribute
to this man’s tact and [[power]] that, steering as he must between so many
diverse interests and opinions [[opinion]], he so largely retains the [[respect]] of
all.

but the hushing of the criticism of honest opponents is a dangerous
thing. it leads some of the [[best]] of the critics to unfortunate silence
and paralysis of effort, and others to burst into [[speech]] so
passionately and intemperately as to lose listeners. honest and earnest
criticism from those whose interests are most nearly touched,—criticism
of writers by readers,—this is the [[soul]] of [[democracy]] and the safeguard
of [[modern]] [[society]]. if the [[best]] of the american negroes receive by outer
pressure a leader whom they had not recognized before, manifestly there
is here a [[certain]] palpable gain. yet there is also irreparable loss,—a
loss of that peculiarly valuable [[education]] which a group receives when
by search and criticism it finds and commissions its own leaders. the
way in which this is done is at once the most elementary and the nicest
problem of social [[growth]]. [[history]] is but the record of such
group-leadership; and yet how infinitely changeful is its type and
character! and of all types and kinds [[kind]], what can be more instructive
than the leadership of a group within a group?—that [[curious]] double
movement where real [[progress]] may be negative and actual advance be
relative retrogression. all this is the social student’s inspiration
and despair.

now in the [[past]] the american negro has had instructive [[experience]] in
the choosing of group leaders, founding thus a peculiar dynasty which
in the [[light]] of [[present]] conditions is worth while studying. when sticks
and stones and beasts form the sole environment of a [[people]], their
attitude is largely one of determined opposition to and [[conquest]] of
natural forces [[force]]. but when to [[earth]] and brute is added an environment of
men and ideas [[idea]], then the attitude of the imprisoned group may take three
main forms,—a feeling of revolt and [[revenge]]; an attempt to adjust all
thought and action to the will of the greater group; or, finally, a
determined effort at self-realization and self-development despite
environing [[opinion]]. the influence of all of these attitudes at various
times can be traced in the [[history]] of the american negro, and in the
evolution of his successive leaders.

before 1750, while the [[fire]] of african [[freedom]] still burned in the
veins of the slaves [[slave]], there was in all leadership or attempted
leadership but the one motive of revolt and [[revenge]],—typified in the
terrible maroons, the danish blacks, and cato of stono, and veiling all
the americas in [[fear]] of insurrection. the liberalizing tendencies of
the latter half of the eighteenth century brought, along with kindlier
relations between black and [[white]], thoughts [[thought]] of ultimate adjustment and
assimilation. such aspiration was especially voiced in the earnest
songs of phyllis, in the martyrdom of attucks, the fighting of salem
and [[poor]], the intellectual accomplishments of banneker and derham, and
the [[political]] demands of the cuffes.

stern financial and social stress after the [[war]] cooled much of the
previous humanitarian ardor. the disappointment and [[impatience]] of the
negroes at the persistence of [[slavery]] and serfdom voiced itself in two
movements. the slaves [[slave]] in the south, aroused undoubtedly by vague rumors
of the haytian revolt, made three fierce attempts at insurrection,—in
1800 under gabriel in virginia, in 1822 under vesey in carolina, and in
1831 again in virginia under the terrible nat turner. in the free
states, on the other hand, a new and [[curious]] attempt at
self-development was made. in philadelphia and new york
color-prescription [[led]] to a withdrawal of negro communicants from white
churches and the formation of a peculiar socio-religious institution
among the negroes known as the african [[church]],—an organization still
living and controlling in its various branches over a million of [[men]].

walker’s wild appeal against the trend of the times [[time]] showed how the
world was changing after the coming of the cotton-gin. by 1830 slavery
seemed hopelessly fastened on the south, and the slaves [[slave]] thoroughly
cowed into submission. the [[free]] negroes of the north, inspired by the
mulatto immigrants from the west indies, began to [[change]] the basis of
their demands; they recognized the [[slavery]] of slaves [[slave]], but insisted that
they themselves were freemen, and sought assimilation and amalgamation
with the nation on the same terms with other [[men]]. thus, forten and
purvis of philadelphia, shad of wilmington, du bois of new haven,
barbadoes of boston, and others, strove singly and together as [[men]],
they said, not as slaves [[slave]]; as “people of color,” not as “negroes.” the
trend of the times [[time]], however, refused them recognition save in
individual and exceptional cases, considered them as one with all the
despised blacks, and they soon found themselves striving to keep even
the rights [[right]] they formerly had of voting and working and moving as
freemen. schemes of migration and colonization arose among them; but
these they refused to entertain, and they eventually turned to the
abolition movement as a final refuge.

here, [[led]] by remond, nell, wells-brown, and douglass, a new period of
self-assertion and self-development dawned. to be sure, ultimate
freedom and assimilation was the ideal before the leaders, but the
assertion of the manhood rights [[right]] of the negro by himself was the main
reliance, and john brown’s raid was the extreme of its [[logic]]. after the
war and emancipation, the [[great]] form of frederick douglass, the
greatest of american negro leaders, still [[led]] the host. self-assertion,
especially in [[political]] lines, was the main programme, and behind
douglass came elliot, bruce, and langston, and the reconstruction
politicians, and, less conspicuous but of greater social significance,
alexander crummell and bishop daniel payne.

then came the [[revolution]] of 1876, the suppression of the negro votes,
the changing and shifting of ideals, and the seeking of new lights [[light]] in
the [[great]] night. douglass, in his old [[age]], still bravely stood for the
ideals of his early manhood,—ultimate assimilation _through_
self-assertion, and on no other terms. for a [[time]] price arose as a new
leader, destined, it seemed, not to give up, but to re-state the old
ideals in a form less repugnant to the [[white]] south. but he passed away
in his prime. then came the new leader. nearly all the former ones had
become leaders by the silent suffrage of their fellows, had sought to
lead their own [[people]] alone, and were usually, save douglass, little
known outside their [[race]]. but booker t. washington arose as essentially
the leader not of one [[race]] but of two,—a compromiser between the south,
the north, and the negro. naturally the negroes resented, at first
bitterly, signs of compromise which surrendered their civil and
political rights [[right]], even though this was to be exchanged for larger
chances of economic [[development]]. the [[rich]] and dominating north,
however, was not only weary of the [[race]] problem, but was investing
largely in southern enterprises, and welcomed any method of peaceful
cooperation. thus, by national [[opinion]], the negroes began to recognize
mr. washington’s leadership; and the voice of criticism was hushed.

mr. washington represents in negro [[thought]] the old attitude of
adjustment and submission; but adjustment at such a peculiar [[time]] as to
make his programme unique. this is an [[age]] of unusual economic
development, and mr. washington’s programme naturally takes an economic
cast, becoming a gospel of [[work]] and [[money]] to such an extent as
apparently almost completely to overshadow the higher aims of [[life]].
moreover, this is an [[age]] when the more advanced races [[race]] are coming in
closer contact with the less developed races [[race]], and the race-feeling is
therefore intensified; and mr. washington’s programme practically
accepts the alleged inferiority of the negro races [[race]]. again, in our own
land, the reaction from the sentiment of [[war]] [[time]] has given impetus to
race-prejudice against negroes, and mr. washington withdraws many of
the high demands of negroes as [[men]] and american [[citizens]]. in other
periods of intensified prejudice all the negro’s tendency to
self-assertion has been called forth; at this period a policy of
submission is advocated. in the [[history]] of nearly all other races [[race]] and
peoples the doctrine preached at such crises has been that manly
self-respect is worth more than lands [[land]] and houses, and that a [[people]] who
voluntarily [[surrender]] such [[respect]], or cease striving for it, are not
worth civilizing.

in [[answer]] to this, it has been claimed that the negro can survive only
through submission. mr. washington distinctly asks that black people
give up, at least for the [[present]], three things,—

first, [[political]] [[power]],

second, insistence on civil rights [[right]],

third, higher [[education]] of negro [[youth]],—and concentrate all their
energies on industrial [[education]], and accumulation of [[wealth]], and the
conciliation of the south. this policy has been courageously and
insistently advocated for over fifteen years, and has been triumphant
for perhaps ten years. as a result of this tender of the palm-branch,
what has been the return? in these years there have occurred:

1. the disfranchisement of the negro.

2. the legal creation of a distinct status of civil inferiority for the
negro.

3. the steady withdrawal of aid from [[institutions]] for the higher
training of the negro.

these movements are not, to be sure, direct results of mr. washington’s
teachings; but his propaganda has, without a shadow of [[doubt]], helped
their speedier accomplishment. the [[question]] then comes: is it possible,
and probable, that nine millions of [[men]] can make effective [[progress]] in
economic lines if they are deprived of [[political]] rights [[right]], made a servile
caste, and allowed only the most meagre [[chance]] for developing their
exceptional [[men]]? if [[history]] and [[reason]] give any distinct [[answer]] to
these questions [[question]], it is an emphatic _no_. and mr. washington thus faces
the triple paradox of his [[career]]:

1. he is striving nobly to make negro artisans [[business]] [[men]] and
property-owners; but it is utterly impossible, under [[modern]] competitive
methods, for workingmen and property-owners to defend their rights [[right]] and
exist without the [[right]] of suffrage.

2. he insists on thrift and self-respect, but at the same [[time]] counsels
a silent submission to civic inferiority such as is bound to sap the
manhood of any [[race]] in the long run.

3. he advocates common-school and industrial training, and depreciates
institutions of higher learning; but neither the negro common-schools,
nor tuskegee itself, could remain open a day were it not for teachers
trained in negro colleges, or trained by their graduates.

this triple paradox in mr. washington’s position is the object of
criticism by two classes of colored americans. one class is spiritually
descended from toussaint the savior, through gabriel, vesey, and
turner, and they represent the attitude of revolt and [[revenge]]; they
hate the [[white]] south blindly and distrust the [[white]] [[race]] generally, and
so far as they agree on definite action, [[think]] that the negro’s only
hope lies [[lie]] in emigration beyond the borders of the [[united]] states. and
yet, by the irony of [[fate]], nothing has more effectually made this
programme seem hopeless than the recent course of the [[united]] states
toward weaker and darker peoples [[people]] in the west indies, hawaii, and the
philippines,—for where in the [[world]] may we go and be safe from lying
and brute [[force]]?

the other class of negroes who cannot agree with mr. washington has
hitherto said little aloud. they deprecate the sight of scattered
counsels, of internal disagreement; and especially they dislike making
their just criticism of a useful and earnest [[man]] an excuse for a
general discharge of venom from small-minded opponents. nevertheless,
the questions [[question]] involved are so fundamental and serious that it is
difficult to see how [[men]] like the grimkes, kelly miller, j. w. e.
bowen, and other representatives of this group, can much longer be
silent. such [[men]] [[feel]] in [[conscience]] bound to ask of this nation three
things:

1. the [[right]] to vote.

2. civic equality.

3. the [[education]] of [[youth]] according to ability. they acknowledge mr.
washington’s invaluable service in counselling patience and courtesy in
such demands; they do not ask that ignorant black [[men]] vote when
ignorant whites are debarred, or that any reasonable restrictions in
the suffrage should not be applied; they [[know]] that the low social level
of the mass of the [[race]] is responsible for much discrimination against
it, but they also [[know]], and the nation knows [[know]], that relentless
color-prejudice is more often a cause than a result of the negro’s
degradation; they seek the abatement of this relic of barbarism, and
not its systematic encouragement and pampering by all agencies of
social [[power]] from the associated press to the [[church]] of [[christ]]. they
advocate, with mr. washington, a broad [[system]] of negro [[common]] schools
supplemented by thorough industrial training; but they are surprised
that a [[man]] of mr. washington’s insight cannot see that no such
educational [[system]] ever has rested or can rest on any other basis than
that of the well-equipped college and [[university]], and they insist that
there is a demand for a few such [[institutions]] throughout the south to
train the [[best]] of the negro [[youth]] as teachers, professional [[men]], and
leaders.

this group of [[men]] [[honor]] mr. washington for his attitude of conciliation
toward the [[white]] south; they accept the “atlanta compromise” in its
broadest interpretation; they recognize, with him, many signs of
promise, many [[men]] of high [[purpose]] and [[fair]] [[judgment]], in this section;
they [[know]] that no easy task has been laid upon a region already
tottering under heavy burdens. but, nevertheless, they insist that the
way to [[truth]] and [[right]] lies [[lie]] in straightforward honesty, not in
indiscriminate [[flattery]]; in praising those of the south who do well and
criticising uncompromisingly those who do ill; in taking advantage of
the opportunities at hand and urging their fellows to do the same, but
at the same [[time]] in remembering that only a firm adherence to their
higher ideals and aspirations will ever keep those ideals within the
realm of possibility. they do not expect that the [[free]] [[right]] to vote,
to enjoy civic rights [[right]], and to be educated, will come in a moment; they
do not expect to see the bias and prejudices of years disappear at the
blast of a trumpet; but they are absolutely [[certain]] that the way for a
people to gain their reasonable rights [[right]] is not by voluntarily throwing
them away and insisting that they do not want them; that the way for a
people to gain [[respect]] is not by continually belittling and ridiculing
themselves; that, on the contrary, negroes must insist continually, in
season and out of season, that voting is necessary to [[modern]] manhood,
that color discrimination is barbarism, and that black boys need
education as well as [[white]] boys.

in failing thus to [[state]] plainly and unequivocally the legitimate
demands of their [[people]], even at the cost of opposing an honored
leader, the thinking classes of american negroes would shirk a heavy
responsibility,—a responsibility to themselves, a responsibility to the
struggling masses, a responsibility to the darker races [[race]] of [[men]] whose
future depends so largely on this american experiment, but especially a
responsibility to this nation,—this [[common]] fatherland. it is [[wrong]] to
encourage a [[man]] or a [[people]] in evil-doing; it is [[wrong]] to aid and abet
a national crime simply because it is unpopular not to do so. the
growing spirit of kindliness and reconciliation between the north and
south after the frightful difference of a [[generation]] ago ought to be a
source of deep congratulation to all, and especially to those whose
mistreatment caused the [[war]]; but if that reconciliation is to be marked
by the industrial [[slavery]] and civic [[death]] of those same black [[men]], with
permanent legislation into a position of inferiority, then those black
men, if they are really [[men]], are called upon by every consideration of
patriotism and loyalty to oppose such a course by all civilized
methods, even though such opposition involves disagreement with mr.
booker t. washington. we have no [[right]] to sit silently by while the
inevitable seeds are sown for a harvest of disaster to our [[children]],
black and [[white]].

first, it is the [[duty]] of black [[men]] to [[judge]] the south discriminatingly.
the [[present]] [[generation]] of southerners are not responsible for the [[past]],
and they should not be blindly hated or blamed for it. furthermore, to
no class is the indiscriminate endorsement of the recent course of the
south toward negroes more nauseating than to the [[best]] [[thought]] of the
south. the south is not “solid’; it is a [[land]] in the ferment of social
change, wherein forces [[force]] of all kinds [[kind]] are fighting for [[supremacy]]; and to
praise the ill the south is today perpetrating is just as [[wrong]] as to
condemn the [[good]]. discriminating and broad-minded criticism is what the
south needs,—needs it for the sake of her own [[white]] sons [[son]] and daughters [[daughter]],
and for the insurance of robust, healthy mental and [[moral]] [[development]].

today even the attitude of the southern whites toward the blacks is
not, as so many assume, in all cases the same; the ignorant southerner
hates the negro, the workingmen [[fear]] his competition, the money-makers
wish to use him as a laborer, some of the educated see a menace in his
upward [[development]], while others—usually the sons [[son]] of the masters—wish
to [[help]] him to rise. national [[opinion]] has enabled this [[last]] class to
maintain the negro [[common]] schools, and to [[protect]] the negro partially
in [[property]], [[life]], and limb. through the pressure of the money-makers,
the negro is in danger of being reduced to semi-slavery, especially in
the [[country]] districts; the workingmen, and those of the educated who
fear the negro, have [[united]] to disfranchise him, and some have urged
his deportation; while the [[passions]] of the ignorant are easily aroused
to lynch and [[abuse]] any black [[man]]. to [[praise]] this intricate whirl of
thought and prejudice is nonsense; to inveigh indiscriminately against
“the south” is [[unjust]]; but to use the same breath in praising governor
aycock, exposing senator morgan, arguing with mr. thomas nelson page,
and denouncing senator ben tillman, is not only sane, but the
imperative [[duty]] of thinking black [[men]].

it would be [[unjust]] to mr. washington not to acknowledge that in several
instances he has opposed movements in the south which were [[unjust]] to
the negro; he sent memorials to the louisiana and alabama
constitutional conventions, he has spoken against lynching, and in
other ways has openly or silently set his influence against sinister
schemes and unfortunate happenings. notwithstanding this, it is equally
true to assert that on the whole the distinct impression left by mr.
washington’s propaganda is, first, that the south is justified in its
present attitude toward the negro because of the negro’s degradation;
secondly, that the prime cause of the negro’s failure to rise more
quickly is his [[wrong]] [[education]] in the [[past]]; and, thirdly, that his
future rise depends primarily on his own efforts. each of these
propositions is a dangerous half-truth. the supplementary truths [[truth]] must
never be lost sight of: first, [[slavery]] and race-prejudice are potent if
not sufficient causes of the negro’s position; second, industrial and
common-school training were necessarily slow in planting because they
had to await the black teachers trained by higher [[institutions]],—it
being extremely doubtful if any essentially different [[development]] was
possible, and certainly a tuskegee was unthinkable before 1880; and,
third, while it is a [[great]] [[truth]] to say that the negro must strive and
strive mightily to [[help]] himself, it is equally true that unless his
striving be not simply seconded, but rather aroused and encouraged, by
the initiative of the richer and wiser environing group, he cannot hope
for [[great]] [[success]].

in his failure to realize and impress this [[last]] point, mr. washington
is especially to be criticised. his doctrine has tended to make the
whites, north and south, shift the burden of the negro problem to the
negro’s shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic
spectators; when in [[fact]] the burden belongs to the nation, and the
hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting
these [[great]] wrongs [[wrong]].

the south ought to be [[led]], by candid and honest criticism, to assert
her [[better]] [[self]] and do her full [[duty]] to the [[race]] she has cruelly
wronged and is still wronging. the north—her co-partner in guilt—cannot
salve her [[conscience]] by plastering it with gold. we cannot settle this
problem by diplomacy and suaveness, by “policy” alone. if worse come to
worst, can the [[moral]] fibre of this [[country]] survive the slow throttling
and murder of nine millions of [[men]]?

the black [[men]] of [[america]] have a [[duty]] to perform, a [[duty]] stern and
delicate,—a forward movement to oppose a part of the [[work]] of their
greatest leader. so far as mr. washington preaches thrift, patience,
and industrial training for the masses, we must hold up his hands and
strive with him, rejoicing in his honors and glorying in the strength
of this joshua called of [[god]] and of [[man]] to lead the headless host. but
so far as mr. washington apologizes for [[injustice]], north or south, does
not rightly value the [[privilege]] and [[duty]] of voting, belittles the
emasculating effects of caste distinctions, and opposes the higher
training and [[ambition]] of our brighter minds [[mind]],—so far as he, the south,
or the nation, does this,—we must unceasingly and firmly oppose them.
by every civilized and peaceful method we must strive for the rights
which the [[world]] accords to [[men]], clinging unwaveringly to those great
words which the sons [[son]] of the fathers [[father]] would fain forget: “we hold these
truths to be self-evident: that all [[men]] are created [[equal]]; that they
are endowed by their creator with [[certain]] unalienable rights [[right]]; that
among these are [[life]], [[liberty]], and the pursuit of [[happiness]].”

once upon a [[time]] i taught school in the hills of tennessee, where the
broad dark vale of the mississippi begins to roll and crumple to greet

that tennessee—beyond the veil—was theirs alone, and in vacation time
they sallied forth in lusty bands to meet the county
school-commissioners. [[young]] and [[happy]], i too went, and i shall not soon
forget that summer, seventeen years ago.

first, there was a teachers’ institute at the county-seat; and there
distinguished guests of the superintendent taught the teachers
fractions and spelling and other mysteries,—white teachers in the
morning, negroes at night. a picnic now and then, and a supper, and the
rough [[world]] was softened by laughter and [[song]]. i [[remember]] how— but i
wander.

there came a day when all the teachers left the institute and began the
hunt for schools. i learn from hearsay (for my [[mother]] was mortally
afraid of firearms) that the hunting of ducks and bears and [[men]] is
wonderfully interesting, but i am sure that the [[man]] who has never
hunted a [[country]] school has something to learn of the pleasures [[pleasure]] of the
chase. i see now the [[white]], hot roads lazily rise and fall and wind
before me under the burning july sun; i [[feel]] the deep weariness of
heart and limb as ten, eight, six miles stretch relentlessly ahead; i
feel my [[heart]] sink heavily as i hear again and again, “got a teacher?
yes.” so i walked on and on—horses were too expensive—until i had
wandered beyond railways, beyond stage lines, to a [[land]] of “varmints”
and rattlesnakes, where the coming of a stranger was an event, and men
lived and died in the shadow of one blue hill.

sprinkled over hill and dale lay cabins and farmhouses, shut out from
the [[world]] by the forests and the rolling hills toward the east. there i
found at [[last]] a little school. josie told me of it; she was a thin,
homely girl of twenty, with a dark-brown face and thick, hard hair. i
had crossed the stream at watertown, and rested under the great
willows; then i had gone to the little cabin in the lot where josie was
resting on her way to town. the gaunt [[farmer]] made me welcome, and
josie, hearing my errand, told me anxiously that they wanted a school
over the hill; that but once since the [[war]] had a teacher been there;
that she herself longed to learn,—and thus she ran on, talking fast and
loud, with much earnestness and energy.

next morning i crossed the tall round hill, lingered to look at the
blue and yellow mountains stretching toward the carolinas, then plunged
into the wood, and came out at josie’s [[home]]. it was a dull frame
cottage with four rooms, perched just below the brow of the hill, amid
peach-trees. the [[father]] was a quiet, simple [[soul]], calmly ignorant, with
no touch of vulgarity. the [[mother]] was different,—strong, bustling, and
energetic, with a quick, restless tongue, and an [[ambition]] to [[live]] “like
folks.” there was a crowd of [[children]]. two boys had gone away. there
remained two growing girls; a shy midget of eight; john, tall, awkward,
and eighteen; jim, younger, quicker, and [[better]] looking; and two babies
of indefinite [[age]]. then there was josie herself. she seemed to be the
centre of the [[family]]: always busy at service, or at [[home]], or
berry-picking; a little nervous and inclined to scold, like her [[mother]],
yet faithful, too, like her [[father]]. she had about her a certain
fineness, the shadow of an unconscious [[moral]] heroism that would
willingly give all of [[life]] to make [[life]] broader, deeper, and fuller for
her and hers. i saw much of this [[family]] afterwards, and grew to love
them for their honest efforts to be decent and comfortable, and for
their [[knowledge]] of their own ignorance. there was with them no
affectation. the [[mother]] would scold the [[father]] for being so “easy’;
josie would roundly berate the boys for carelessness; and all knew that
it was a hard thing to dig a living out of a rocky side-hill.

i secured the school. i [[remember]] the day i rode horseback out to the
commissioner’s house with a pleasant [[young]] [[white]] fellow who wanted the
white school. the road ran down the bed of a stream; the sun laughed
and the water jingled, and we rode on. “come in,” said the
commissioner,—‘come in. have a seat. yes, that certificate will do.
stay to dinner. what do you want a month?” “oh,” [[thought]] i, “this is
lucky’; but even then fell the awful shadow of the veil, for they ate
first, then i—alone.

the schoolhouse was a log hut, where colonel wheeler used to shelter
his corn. it sat in a lot behind a rail fence and thorn bushes, near
the sweetest of springs. there was an entrance where a door once was,
and within, a massive rickety fireplace; [[great]] chinks between the logs
served as windows. furniture was scarce. a pale blackboard crouched in
the corner. my desk was made of three boards, reinforced at critical
points, and my chair, borrowed from the landlady, had to be returned
every night. seats for the children—these puzzled me much. i was
haunted by a new [[england]] vision of neat little desks and chairs, but,
alas! the reality was rough plank benches without backs, and at times
without legs. they had the one [[virtue]] of making naps
dangerous,—possibly fatal, for the floor was not to be trusted.

it was a hot morning late in july when the school opened. i trembled
when i heard the patter of little feet down the dusty road, and saw the
growing row of dark solemn faces and bright eager [[eyes]] facing me. first
came josie and her brothers [[brother]] and sisters. the longing to [[know]], to be a
student in the [[great]] school at nashville, hovered like a star above
this child-woman amid her [[work]] and worry, and she [[studied]] doggedly.
there were the dowells from their farm over toward alexandria,—fanny,
with her smooth black face and wondering [[eyes]]; martha, brown and dull;
the pretty girl-wife of a [[brother]], and the younger brood.

there were the burkes,—two brown and yellow lads, and a tiny
haughty-eyed girl. fat reuben’s little chubby girl came, with golden
face and old-gold hair, faithful and solemn. ’thenie was on hand
early,—a jolly, ugly, good-hearted girl, who slyly dipped snuff and
looked after her little bow-legged [[brother]]. when her [[mother]] could spare
her, ’tildy came,—a midnight [[beauty]], with starry [[eyes]] and tapering
limbs; and her [[brother]], correspondingly homely. and then the big
boys,—the hulking lawrences; the lazy neills, unfathered sons [[son]] of mother
and [[daughter]]; hickman, with a stoop in his shoulders; and the rest.

there they sat, nearly thirty of them, on the rough benches, their
faces shading from a pale cream to a deep brown, the little feet bare
and swinging, the [[eyes]] full of expectation, with here and there a
twinkle of mischief, and the hands grasping webster’s blue-black
spelling-book. i loved my school, and the fine [[faith]] the [[children]] had
in the [[wisdom]] of their teacher was truly marvellous. we [[read]] and
spelled together, wrote a little, picked flowers, sang, and listened to
stories of the [[world]] beyond the hill. at times [[time]] the school would dwindle
away, and i would start out. i would visit mun eddings, who lived in
two very dirty rooms, and ask why little lugene, whose flaming face
seemed ever ablaze with the dark-red hair uncombed, was absent all last
week, or why i missed so often the inimitable rags of mack and ed. then
the [[father]], who worked colonel wheeler’s farm on shares, would tell me
how the crops needed the boys; and the thin, slovenly [[mother]], whose
face was pretty when washed, assured me that lugene must [[mind]] the baby.
“but we’ll start them again next week.” when the lawrences stopped, i
knew that the doubts [[doubt]] of the old folks about book-learning had conquered
again, and so, toiling up the hill, and getting as far into the cabin
as possible, i put cicero “pro archia poeta” into the simplest english
with local applications, and usually convinced them—for a week or so.

on friday nights i often went [[home]] with some of the [[children]],—sometimes
to doc burke’s farm. he was a [[great]], loud, thin black, ever working,
and trying to buy the seventy-five acres of hill and dale where he
lived; but [[people]] said that he would surely fail, and the “white folks
would get it all.” his [[wife]] was a magnificent amazon, with saffron face
and shining hair, uncorseted and barefooted, and the [[children]] were
strong and beautiful. they lived in a one-and-a-half-room cabin in the
hollow of the farm, near the spring. the front room was full of great
fat [[white]] beds, scrupulously neat; and there were [[bad]] chromos on the
walls, and a tired centre-table. in the tiny back kitchen i was often
invited to “take out and help” myself to fried chicken and wheat
biscuit, “meat” and corn pone, string-beans and berries. at first i
used to be a little alarmed at the approach of bedtime in the one lone
bedroom, but embarrassment was very deftly avoided. first, all the
children nodded and slept, and were stowed away in one [[great]] pile of
goose feathers; next, the [[mother]] and the [[father]] discreetly slipped away
to the kitchen while i went to bed; then, blowing out the dim [[light]],
they retired in the dark. in the morning all were up and away before i
thought of awaking. across the road, where fat reuben lived, they all
went outdoors while the teacher retired, because they did not boast the
luxury of a kitchen.

i liked to stay with the dowells, for they had four rooms and plenty of
good [[country]] fare. uncle bird had a small, rough farm, all woods and
hills, miles from the big road; but he was full of tales,—he preached
now and then,—and with his [[children]], berries, horses, and wheat he was
happy and prosperous. often, to keep the [[peace]], i must go where life
was less lovely; for instance, ’tildy’s [[mother]] was incorrigibly dirty,
reuben’s larder was limited seriously, and herds of untamed insects
wandered over the eddingses’ beds. [[best]] of all i loved to go to
josie’s, and sit on the porch, eating peaches, while the [[mother]] bustled
and talked: how josie had bought the sewing-machine; how josie worked
at service in winter, but that four dollars a month was “mighty little”
wages; how josie longed to go away to school, but that it “looked like”
they never could get far enough ahead to let her; how the crops failed
and the well was yet unfinished; and, finally, how “mean” some of the
white folks were.

for two summers i lived in this little [[world]]; it was dull and humdrum.
the girls looked at the hill in wistful longing, and the boys fretted
and haunted alexandria. alexandria was “town,”—a straggling, lazy
village of houses, churches [[church]], and shops, and an [[aristocracy]] of toms,
dicks, and captains. cuddled on the hill to the north was the village
of the colored folks, who lived in three- or four-room unpainted
cottages, some neat and homelike, and some dirty. the dwellings were
scattered rather aimlessly, but they centred about the twin temples of
the hamlet, the methodist, and the hard-shell baptist churches [[church]]. these,
in turn, leaned gingerly on a sad-colored schoolhouse. hither my little
world wended its crooked way on sunday to meet other worlds [[world]], and
gossip, and wonder, and make the weekly [[sacrifice]] with frenzied priest
at the altar of the “old-time [[religion]].” then the soft melody and
mighty cadences of negro [[song]] fluttered and thundered.

i have called my tiny [[community]] a [[world]], and so its isolation made it;
and yet there was among us but a half-awakened [[common]] [[consciousness]],
sprung from [[common]] joy and [[grief]], at burial, birth, or wedding; from a
common hardship in [[poverty]], [[poor]] [[land]], and low wages; and, above all,
from the sight of the veil that hung between us and opportunity. all
this caused us to [[think]] some thoughts [[thought]] together; but these, when ripe
for [[speech]], were spoken in various languages [[language]]. those whose eyes
twenty-five and more years before had seen “the [[glory]] of the coming of
the [[lord]],” saw in every [[present]] hindrance or [[help]] a dark fatalism bound
to bring all things [[right]] in his own [[good]] [[time]]. the mass of those to
whom [[slavery]] was a dim recollection of [[childhood]] found the [[world]] a
puzzling thing: it [[asked]] little of them, and they answered with little,
and yet it ridiculed their offering. such a paradox they could not
understand, and therefore sank into listless indifference, or
shiftlessness, or reckless bravado. there were, however, some—such as
josie, jim, and ben—to whom [[war]], hell, and [[slavery]] were but childhood
tales, whose [[young]] appetites had been whetted to an edge by school and
story and half-awakened [[thought]]. ill could they be content, born
without and beyond the [[world]]. and their [[weak]] wings beat against their
barriers,—barriers of caste, of [[youth]], of [[life]]; at [[last]], in dangerous
moments, against everything that opposed even a whim.

the ten years that [[follow]] [[youth]], the years when first the realization
comes that [[life]] is leading somewhere,—these were the years that passed
after i left my little school. when they were [[past]], i came by chance
once more to the walls of fisk [[university]], to the halls of the chapel
of melody. as i lingered there in the joy and [[pain]] of meeting old
school-friends, there swept over me a sudden longing to pass again
beyond the blue hill, and to see the homes [[home]] and the school of other
days, and to learn how [[life]] had gone with my school-children; and i
went.

josie was [[dead]], and the gray-haired [[mother]] said simply, “we’ve had a
heap of trouble since you’ve been away.” i had feared for jim. with a
cultured parentage and a social caste to uphold him, he might have made
a venturesome merchant or a west point cadet. but here he was, angry
with [[life]] and reckless; and when fanner durham charged him with
stealing wheat, the old [[man]] had to ride fast to escape the stones which
the furious [[fool]] hurled after him. they told jim to run away; but he
would not run, and the constable came that afternoon. it [[grieved]] josie,
and [[great]] awkward john walked nine miles every day to see his little
brother through the bars of lebanon jail. at [[last]] the two came back
together in the dark night. the [[mother]] cooked supper, and josie emptied
her purse, and the boys stole away. josie grew thin and silent, yet
worked the more. the hill became steep for the quiet old [[father]], and
with the boys away there was little to do in the valley. josie helped
them to sell the old farm, and they moved nearer town. [[brother]] dennis,
the carpenter, built a new house with six rooms; josie toiled a year in
nashville, and brought back ninety dollars to furnish the house and
change it to a [[home]].

when the spring came, and the birds twittered, and the stream ran proud
and full, little sister lizzie, bold and thoughtless, flushed with the
passion of [[youth]], bestowed herself on the tempter, and brought [[home]] a
nameless child. josie shivered and worked on, with the vision of
schooldays all fled, with a face wan and tired,—worked until, on a
summer’s day, some one [[married]] another; then josie crept to her mother
like a hurt child, and slept—and sleeps.

i paused to scent the breeze as i entered the valley. the lawrences
have gone,—father and [[son]] forever,—and the other [[son]] lazily digs in the
earth to [[live]]. a new [[young]] widow rents out their cabin to fat reuben.
reuben is a baptist preacher now, but i [[fear]] as lazy as ever, though
his cabin has three rooms; and little ella has grown into a bouncing
woman, and is ploughing corn on the hot hillside. there are babies
a-plenty, and one half-witted girl. across the valley is a house i did
not [[know]] before, and there i found, rocking one baby and expecting
another, one of my schoolgirls, a [[daughter]] of uncle bird dowell. she
looked somewhat worried with her new duties [[duty]], but soon bristled into
pride over her neat cabin and the tale of her thrifty husband, and the
horse and cow, and the farm they were planning to buy.

my log schoolhouse was gone. in its place stood [[progress]]; and [[progress]],
i [[understand]], is necessarily ugly. the crazy foundation stones still
marked the former site of my [[poor]] little cabin, and not far away, on
six weary boulders, perched a jaunty board house, perhaps twenty by
thirty feet, with three windows and a door that locked. some of the
window-glass was broken, and part of an old iron stove lay mournfully
under the house. i peeped through the window half reverently, and found
things that were more familiar. the blackboard had grown by about two
feet, and the seats were still without backs. the county owns the lot
now, i hear, and every year there is a session of school. as i sat by
the spring and looked on the old and the new i [[felt]] glad, very glad,
and yet—

after two long drinks i started on. there was the [[great]] double
log-house on the corner. i remembered the broken, blighted [[family]] that
used to [[live]] there. the [[strong]], hard face of the [[mother]], with its
wilderness of hair, rose before me. she had driven her husband away,
and while i taught school a [[strange]] [[man]] lived there, big and jovial,
and [[people]] talked. i [[felt]] sure that ben and ’tildy would come to naught
from such a [[home]]. but this is an odd [[world]]; for ben is a busy [[farmer]] in
smith county, “doing well, too,” they say, and he had cared for little
’tildy until [[last]] spring, when a lover [[married]] her. a hard [[life]] the lad
had [[led]], toiling for meat, and laughed at because he was homely and
crooked. there was sam carlon, an impudent old skinflint, who had
definite notions about “niggers,” and hired ben a summer and would not
pay him. then the hungry boy gathered his sacks together, and in broad
daylight went into carlon’s corn; and when the hard-fisted [[farmer]] set
upon him, the angry boy flew at him like a beast. doc burke saved a
murder and a lynching that day.

the story reminded me again of the burkes, and an [[impatience]] seized me
to [[know]] who won in the [[battle]], doc or the seventy-five acres. for it is
a hard thing to make a farm out of nothing, even in fifteen years. so i
hurried on, thinking of the burkes. they used to have a certain
magnificent barbarism about them that i liked. they were never vulgar,
never immoral, but rather rough and primitive, with an
unconventionality that spent itself in loud guffaws, slaps on the back,
and naps in the corner. i hurried by the cottage of the misborn neill
boys. it was empty, and they were grown into fat, lazy farm-hands. i
saw the [[home]] of the hickmans, but albert, with his stooping shoulders,
had passed from the [[world]]. then i came to the burkes’ gate and peered
through; the enclosure looked rough and untrimmed, and yet there were
the same fences around the old farm save to the left, where lay
twenty-five other acres. and lo! the cabin in the hollow had climbed
the hill and swollen to a half-finished six-room cottage.

the burkes held a hundred acres, but they were still in debt. indeed,
the gaunt [[father]] who toiled night and day would scarcely be [[happy]] out
of debt, being so used to it. some day he must stop, for his massive
frame is showing decline. the [[mother]] wore shoes, but the lion-like
physique of other days was broken. the [[children]] had grown up. rob, the
image of his [[father]], was loud and rough with laughter. birdie, my
school baby of six, had grown to a picture of maiden [[beauty]], tall and
tawny. “edgar is gone,” said the [[mother]], with head half bowed,—‘gone to
work in nashville; he and his [[father]] couldn’t agree.”

little doc, the boy born since the [[time]] of my school, took me horseback
down the creek next morning toward [[farmer]] dowell’s. the road and the
stream were battling for mastery, and the stream had the [[better]] of it.
we splashed and waded, and the merry boy, perched behind me, chattered
and laughed. he showed me where simon thompson had bought a bit of
ground and a [[home]]; but his [[daughter]] lana, a plump, brown, slow girl,
was not there. she had [[married]] a [[man]] and a farm twenty miles away. we
wound on down the stream till we came to a gate that i did not
recognize, but the boy insisted that it was “uncle bird’s.” the farm
was fat with the growing crop. in that little valley was a strange
stillness as i rode up; for [[death]] and [[marriage]] had stolen [[youth]] and
left [[age]] and [[childhood]] there. we sat and talked that night after the
chores were done. uncle bird was grayer, and his [[eyes]] did not see so
well, but he was still jovial. we talked of the acres bought,—one
hundred and twenty-five,—of the new guest-chamber added, of martha’s
marrying. then we talked of [[death]]: fanny and fred were gone; a shadow
hung over the other [[daughter]], and when it lifted she was to go to
nashville to school. at [[last]] we spoke of the neighbors, and as night
fell, uncle bird told me how, on a night like that, ’thenie came
wandering back to her [[home]] over yonder, to escape the blows of her
husband. and next morning she died in the [[home]] that her little
bow-legged [[brother]], working and saving, had bought for their widowed
mother.

my [[journey]] was done, and behind me lay hill and dale, and [[life]] and
death. how shall [[man]] measure [[progress]] there where the dark-faced josie
lies? how many heartfuls of [[sorrow]] shall balance a bushel of wheat? how
hard a thing is [[life]] to the lowly, and yet how [[human]] and real! and all
this [[life]] and [[love]] and strife and failure,—is it the twilight of
nightfall or the flush of some faint-dawning day?

thus sadly musing, i rode to nashville in the jim crow car.




v.
of the wings of atalanta

o black boy of atlanta!
    but half was spoken;
the slave’s chains and the master’s
    alike are broken;
the one curse of the races
    held both in tether;
they are rising—all are rising—
    the black and [[white]] together.

whittier.

[illustration]


south of the north, yet north of the south, lies [[lie]] the [[city]] of a hundred
hills, peering out from the shadows of the [[past]] into the promise of the
future. i have seen her in the morning, when the first flush of day had
half-roused her; she lay gray and still on the crimson soil of georgia;
then the blue smoke began to curl from her chimneys, the tinkle of bell
and scream of whistle broke the [[silence]], the rattle and roar of busy
life slowly gathered and swelled, until the seething whirl of the city
seemed a [[strange]] thing in a sleepy [[land]].

once, they say, even atlanta slept dull and drowsy at the foot-hills of
the alleghanies, until the iron baptism of [[war]] awakened her with its
sullen waters, aroused and maddened her, and left her listening to the
sea. and the sea cried to the hills and the hills answered the sea,
till the [[city]] rose like a widow and cast away her weeds, and toiled for
her daily bread; toiled steadily, toiled cunningly,—perhaps with some
bitterness, with a touch, of _réclame_,—and yet with real earnestness,
and real sweat.

it is a hard thing to [[live]] haunted by the ghost of an untrue [[dream]]; to
see the wide vision of [[empire]] fade into real ashes and dirt; to feel
the pang of the conquered, and yet [[know]] that with all the [[bad]] that fell
on one black day, something was vanquished that deserved to [[live]],
something killed that in [[justice]] had not dared to [[die]]; to [[know]] that
with the [[right]] that triumphed, triumphed something of [[wrong]], something
sordid and mean, something less than the broadest and [[best]]. all this is
bitter hard; and many a [[man]] and [[city]] and [[people]] have found in it excuse
for sulking, and brooding, and listless waiting.

such are not [[men]] of the sturdier make; they of atlanta turned
resolutely toward the future; and that future held aloft vistas of
purple and gold:—atlanta, queen of the cotton [[kingdom]]; atlanta, gateway
to the [[land]] of the sun; atlanta, the new lachesis, spinner of web and
woof for the [[world]]. so the [[city]] crowned her hundred hills with
factories, and stored her shops with cunning handiwork, and stretched
long iron ways to greet the busy mercury in his coming. and the nation
talked of her striving.

perhaps atlanta was not christened for the winged maiden of dull
boeotia; you [[know]] the tale,—how swarthy atalanta, tall and wild, would
marry only him who out-raced her; and how the wily hippomenes laid
three apples of gold in the way. she fled like a shadow, paused,
startled over the first apple, but even as he stretched his hand, fled
again; hovered over the second, then, slipping from his hot grasp, flew
over river, vale, and hill; but as she lingered over the third, his
arms fell round her, and looking on each other, the blazing passion of
their [[love]] profaned the sanctuary of [[love]], and they were cursed. if
atlanta be not named for atalanta, she ought to have been.

atalanta is not the first or the [[last]] maiden whom greed of gold has led
to defile the temple of [[love]]; and not maids alone, but [[men]] in the race
of [[life]], sink from the high and generous ideals of [[youth]] to the
gambler’s code of the bourse; and in all our nation’s striving is not
the gospel of [[work]] befouled by the gospel of [[pay]]? so [[common]] is this
that one-half [[think]] it normal; so unquestioned, that we almost [[fear]] to
question if the end of racing is not gold, if the aim of [[man]] is not
rightly to be [[rich]]. and if this is the [[fault]] of [[america]], how dire a
danger lies [[lie]] before a new [[land]] and a new [[city]], lest atlanta, stooping
for mere gold, shall find that gold accursed!

it was no maiden’s idle whim that started this hard racing; a fearful
wilderness lay about the feet of that [[city]] after the [[war]],—feudalism,
poverty, the rise of the third estate, serfdom, the re-birth of [[law]] and
order, and above and between all, the veil of [[race]]. how heavy a journey
for weary feet! what wings must atalanta have to flit over all this
hollow and hill, through sour wood and sullen water, and by the red
waste of sun-baked clay! how fleet must atalanta be if she will not be
tempted by gold to profane the sanctuary!

the sanctuary of our fathers [[father]] has, to be sure, few gods,—some sneer,
“all too few.” there is the thrifty mercury of new [[england]], pluto of
the north, and ceres of the west; and there, too, is the half-forgotten
apollo of the south, under whose aegis the maiden ran,—and as she ran
she forgot him, even as there in boeotia [[venus]] was forgot. she forgot
the old ideal of the southern gentleman,—that new-world heir of the
grace and courtliness of patrician, knight, and [[noble]]; forgot his honor
with his foibles, his kindliness with his carelessness, and stooped to
apples of gold,—to [[men]] busier and sharper, thriftier and more
unscrupulous. golden apples are beautiful—i [[remember]] the lawless days
of boyhood, when orchards in crimson and gold tempted me over fence and
field—and, too, the merchant who has dethroned the planter is no
despicable parvenu. [[work]] and [[wealth]] are the mighty levers to lift this
old new [[land]]; thrift and toil and saving are the highways to new hopes
and new possibilities; and yet the warning is needed lest the wily
hippomenes tempt atalanta to thinking that golden apples are the goal
of racing, and not mere incidents by the way.

atlanta must not lead the south to [[dream]] of material [[prosperity]] as the
touchstone of all [[success]]; already the fatal might of this [[idea]] is
beginning to spread; it is replacing the finer type of southerner with
vulgar money-getters; it is burying the sweeter beauties [[beauty]] of southern
life beneath pretence and ostentation. for every social ill the panacea
of [[wealth]] has been urged,—wealth to overthrow the remains of the slave
feudalism; [[wealth]] to raise the “cracker” third estate; [[wealth]] to employ
the black serfs, and the prospect of [[wealth]] to keep them working;
wealth as the end and aim of [[politics]], and as the legal tender for law
and order; and, finally, instead of [[truth]], [[beauty]], and goodness, wealth
as the ideal of the [[public]] school.

not only is this true in the [[world]] which atlanta typifies, but it is
threatening to be true of a [[world]] beneath and beyond that [[world]],—the
black [[world]] beyond the veil. today it makes little difference to
atlanta, to the south, what the negro thinks [[think]] or dreams [[dream]] or wills. in the
soul-life of the [[land]] he is to-day, and naturally will long remain,
unthought of, half forgotten; and yet when he does come to [[think]] and
will and do for himself,—and let no [[man]] [[dream]] that day will never
come,—then the part he plays will not be one of sudden learning, but
words and thoughts [[thought]] he has been taught to lisp in his race-childhood.
to-day the ferment of his striving toward self-realization is to the
strife of the [[white]] [[world]] like a wheel within a wheel: beyond the veil
are smaller but like problems of ideals, of leaders and the [[led]], of
serfdom, of [[poverty]], of order and subordination, and, through all, the
veil of [[race]]. few [[know]] of these problems, few who [[know]] notice them; and
yet there they are, awaiting student, artist, and seer,—a field for
somebody sometime to discover. hither has the temptation of hippomenes
penetrated; already in this smaller [[world]], which now indirectly and
anon directly must influence the larger for [[good]] or ill, the habit is
forming of interpreting the [[world]] in dollars. the old leaders of negro
opinion, in the little groups where there is a negro social
consciousness, are being replaced by new; neither the black preacher
nor the black teacher leads as he did two decades ago. into their
places are pushing the farmers [[farmer]] and gardeners, the well-paid porters and
artisans, the business-men,—all those with [[property]] and [[money]]. and with
all this [[change]], so curiously parallel to that of the other-world, goes
too the same inevitable [[change]] in ideals. the south laments to-day the
slow, steady disappearance of a [[certain]] type of negro,—the faithful,
courteous [[slave]] of other days, with his incorruptible honesty and
dignified [[humility]]. he is passing away just as surely as the old type
of southern gentleman is passing, and from not dissimilar causes,—the
sudden transformation of a [[fair]] far-off ideal of [[freedom]] into the hard
reality of bread-winning and the consequent deification of bread.

in the black [[world]], the preacher and teacher embodied once the ideals
of this people—the strife for another and a juster [[world]], the vague
dream of [[righteousness]], the mystery of knowing; but to-day the danger
is that these ideals, with their simple [[beauty]] and weird inspiration,
will suddenly sink to a [[question]] of cash and a [[lust]] for gold. here
stands this black [[young]] atalanta, girding herself for the [[race]] that
must be run; and if her [[eyes]] be still toward the hills and [[sky]] as in
the days of old, then we may look for [[noble]] running; but what if some
ruthless or wily or even thoughtless hippomenes lay golden apples
before her? what if the negro [[people]] be wooed from a strife for
righteousness, from a [[love]] of knowing, to regard dollars as the be-all
and end-all of [[life]]? what if to the mammonism of [[america]] be added the
rising mammonism of the re-born south, and the mammonism of this south
be reinforced by the budding mammonism of its half-wakened black
millions? whither, then, is the new-world quest of goodness and beauty
and [[truth]] gone glimmering? must this, and that [[fair]] flower of freedom
which, despite the jeers of latter-day striplings, sprung from our
fathers’ [[blood]], must that too degenerate into a dusty quest of
gold,—into lawless [[lust]] with hippomenes?

the hundred hills of atlanta are not all crowned with factories. on
one, toward the west, the setting sun throws three buildings in bold
relief against the [[sky]]. the [[beauty]] of the group lies [[lie]] in its simple
unity:—a broad lawn of green rising from the red street and mingled
roses and peaches; north and south, two plain and stately halls; and in
the midst, half hidden in ivy, a larger building, boldly graceful,
sparingly decorated, and with one low spire. it is a restful group,
—one never looks for more; it is all here, all intelligible. there i
live, and there i hear from day to day the low hum of restful [[life]]. in
winter’s twilight, when the red sun glows, i can see the dark figures
pass between the halls to the [[music]] of the night-bell. in the morning,
when the sun is golden, the clang of the day-bell brings the hurry and
laughter of three hundred [[young]] hearts [[heart]] from hall and street, and from
the busy [[city]] below,—children all dark and heavy-haired,—to join their
clear [[young]] voices in the [[music]] of the morning [[sacrifice]]. in a
half-dozen class-rooms they gather then,—here to [[follow]] the love-song
of dido, here to listen to the tale of troy [[divine]]; there to wander
among the stars, there to wander among [[men]] and nations,—and elsewhere
other well-worn ways of knowing this queer [[world]]. nothing new, no
time-saving devices,—simply old time-glorified methods of delving for
truth, and searching out the hidden beauties [[beauty]] of [[life]], and learning the
good of living. the riddle of existence is the college curriculum that
was laid before the pharaohs, that was taught in the groves by [[plato]],
that formed the _trivium_ and _quadrivium_, and is to-day laid before
the freedmen’s sons [[son]] by atlanta [[university]]. and this course of study
will not [[change]]; its methods will grow more deft and effectual, its
content richer by toil of scholar and sight of seer; but the true
college will ever have one goal,—not to earn meat, but to [[know]] the end
and aim of that [[life]] which meat nourishes.

the vision of [[life]] that rises before these dark [[eyes]] has in it nothing
mean or selfish. not at oxford or at leipsic, not at yale or columbia,
is there an air of higher resolve or more unfettered striving; the
determination to realize for [[men]], both black and [[white]], the broadest
possibilities of [[life]], to seek the [[better]] and the [[best]], to spread with
their own hands the gospel of [[sacrifice]],—all this is the burden of
their talk and [[dream]]. here, amid a wide desert of caste and
proscription, amid the heart-hurting slights and jars and vagaries of a
deep race-dislike, lies [[lie]] this green oasis, where hot anger cools, and
the bitterness of disappointment is sweetened by the springs and
breezes of parnassus; and here [[men]] may [[lie]] and listen, and learn of a
future fuller than the [[past]], and hear the voice of [[time]]:

“entbehren sollst du, sollst entbehren.”


they made their mistakes, those who planted fisk and howard and atlanta
before the smoke of [[battle]] had lifted; they made their mistakes, but
those mistakes were not the things at which we lately laughed somewhat
uproariously. they were [[right]] when they sought to found a new
educational [[system]] upon the [[university]]: where, forsooth, shall we
ground [[knowledge]] save on the broadest and deepest [[knowledge]]? the roots
of the tree, rather than the leaves, are the sources of its [[life]]; and
from the dawn of [[history]], from academus to cambridge, the [[culture]] of
the [[university]] has been the broad foundation-stone on which is built
the kindergarten’s a b c.

but these builders did make a mistake in minimizing the gravity of the
problem before them; in thinking it a matter of years and decades; in
therefore building quickly and laying their foundation carelessly, and
lowering the standard of knowing, until they had scattered haphazard
through the south some dozen poorly equipped high schools and miscalled
them universities [[university]]. they forgot, too, just as their successors are
forgetting, the [[rule]] of inequality:—that of the million black [[youth]],
some were fitted to [[know]] and some to dig; that some had the talent and
capacity of [[university]] [[men]], and some the talent and capacity of
blacksmiths; and that true training meant neither that all should be
college [[men]] nor all artisans, but that the one should be made a
missionary of [[culture]] to an untaught [[people]], and the other a free
workman among serfs. and to seek to make the blacksmith a scholar is
almost as silly as the more [[modern]] scheme of making the scholar a
blacksmith; almost, but not quite.

the function of the [[university]] is not simply to [[teach]] bread-winning, or
to furnish teachers for the [[public]] schools or to be a centre of polite
society; it is, above all, to be the organ of that fine adjustment
between real [[life]] and the growing [[knowledge]] of [[life]], an adjustment
which forms the secret of [[civilization]]. such an institution the south
of to-day sorely needs. she has [[religion]], earnest, bigoted:—religion
that on both sides the veil often omits the sixth, seventh, and eighth
commandments, but substitutes a dozen supplementary ones. she has, as
atlanta shows, growing thrift and [[love]] of toil; but she lacks that
broad [[knowledge]] of what the [[world]] knows [[know]] and knew of [[human]] living and
doing, which she may apply to the thousand problems of real [[life]] to-day
confronting her. the need of the south is [[knowledge]] and [[culture]],—not in
dainty limited quantity, as before the [[war]], but in broad busy abundance
in the [[world]] of [[work]]; and until she has this, not all the apples of
hesperides, be they golden and bejewelled, can save her from the curse
of the boeotian lovers.

the wings of atalanta are the coming universities [[university]] of the south. they
alone can bear the maiden [[past]] the temptation of golden fruit. they
will not guide her flying feet away from the cotton and gold; for—ah,
thoughtful hippomenes!—do not the apples [[lie]] in the very way of [[life]]?
but they will guide her over and beyond them, and leave her kneeling in
the sanctuary of [[truth]] and [[freedom]] and broad [[humanity]], virgin and
undefiled. sadly did the old south err in [[human]] [[education]], despising
the [[education]] of the masses, and niggardly in the support of colleges.
her ancient [[university]] foundations dwindled and withered under the foul
breath of [[slavery]]; and even since the [[war]] they have fought a failing
fight for [[life]] in the tainted air of social unrest and commercial
selfishness, stunted by the [[death]] of criticism, and starving for lack
of broadly cultured [[men]]. and if this is the [[white]] south’s need and
danger, how much heavier the danger and need of the freedmen’s sons!
how pressing here the need of broad ideals and true [[culture]], the
conservation of [[soul]] from sordid aims and petty passions! let us build
the southern university—william and [[mary]], trinity, georgia, texas,
tulane, vanderbilt, and the others—fit to [[live]]; let us build, too, the
negro universities [[university]]:—fisk, whose foundation was ever broad; howard, at
the [[heart]] of the nation; atlanta at atlanta, whose ideal of scholarship
has been held above the temptation of numbers. why not here, and
perhaps elsewhere, plant deeply and for all [[time]] centres of learning
and living, colleges that yearly would send into the [[life]] of the south
a few [[white]] [[men]] and a few black [[men]] of broad [[culture]], catholic
tolerance, and trained ability, joining their hands to other hands, and
giving to this squabble of the races [[race]] a decent and dignified [[peace]]?

patience, [[humility]], manners, and taste, [[common]] schools and
kindergartens, industrial and technical schools, literature and
tolerance,—all these spring from [[knowledge]] and [[culture]], the [[children]] of
the [[university]]. so must [[men]] and nations build, not otherwise, not
upside down.

teach workers to [[work]],—a [[wise]] saying; [[wise]] when applied to [[german]] boys
and american girls; wiser when said of negro boys, for they have less
knowledge of working and none to [[teach]] them. [[teach]] thinkers to [[think]],—a
needed [[knowledge]] in a day of loose and careless [[logic]]; and they whose
lot is gravest must have the carefulest training to [[think]] aright. if
these things are so, how foolish to ask what is the [[best]] [[education]] for
one or seven or sixty million souls! shall we [[teach]] them trades [[trade]], or
train them in liberal [[arts]]? neither and both: [[teach]] the workers to work
and the thinkers to [[think]]; make carpenters of carpenters, and
philosophers of [[philosophers]], and fops of fools [[fool]]. nor can we pause here.
we are training not isolated [[men]] but a living group of [[men]],—nay, a
group within a group. and the final product of our training must be
neither a psychologist nor a brickmason, but a [[man]]. and to make [[men]], we
must have ideals, broad, pure, and inspiring ends of living,—not sordid
money-getting, not apples of gold. the worker must [[work]] for the glory
of his handiwork, not simply for [[pay]]; the thinker must [[think]] for [[truth]],
not for fame. and all this is gained only by [[human]] strife and longing;
by ceaseless training and [[education]]; by founding [[right]] on righteousness
and [[truth]] on the unhampered search for [[truth]]; by founding the common
school on the [[university]], and the industrial school on the common
school; and weaving thus a [[system]], not a distortion, and bringing a
birth, not an abortion.

when night falls on the [[city]] of a hundred hills, a wind gathers itself
from the seas and comes murmuring westward. and at its bidding, the
smoke of the drowsy factories sweeps down upon the mighty [[city]] and
covers it like a pall, while yonder at the [[university]] the stars twinkle
above stone hall. and they say that yon gray mist is the tunic of
atalanta pausing over her golden apples. fly, my maiden, fly, for
yonder comes hippomenes!




vi.
of the training of black men

why, if the [[soul]] can fling the dust aside,
and naked on the air of [[heaven]] ride,
    were’t not a shame—were’t not a shame for him
in this clay carcase crippled to abide?

omar khayyám (fitzgerald).

from the shimmering swirl of waters where many, many thoughts [[thought]] ago the
slave-ship first saw the square tower of jamestown, have flowed down to
our day three streams of thinking: one swollen from the larger world
here and overseas, saying, the multiplying of [[human]] wants in
culture-lands calls for the world-wide cooperation of [[men]] in satisfying
them. hence arises a new [[human]] unity, pulling the ends of [[earth]] nearer,
and all [[men]], black, yellow, and [[white]]. the larger [[humanity]] strives to
feel in this contact of living nations and sleeping hordes a thrill of
new [[life]] in the [[world]], crying, “if the contact of [[life]] and sleep be
death, shame on such [[life]].” to be sure, behind this [[thought]] lurks the
afterthought of [[force]] and dominion,—the making of brown [[men]] to delve
when the temptation of beads and red calico cloys.

the second [[thought]] streaming from the death-ship and the curving river
is the [[thought]] of the older south,—the sincere and passionate belief
that somewhere between [[men]] and cattle, [[god]] created a _tertium quid_,
and called it a negro,—a clownish, simple creature, at times [[time]] even
lovable within its limitations, but straitly foreordained to walk
within the veil. to be sure, behind the [[thought]] lurks the
afterthought,—some of them with favoring [[chance]] might become [[men]], but
in sheer self-defence we dare not let them, and we build about them
walls so high, and hang between them and the [[light]] a veil so thick,
that they shall not even [[think]] of breaking through.

and [[last]] of all there trickles down that third and darker [[thought]],—the
thought of the things themselves, the confused, half-conscious mutter
of [[men]] who are black and whitened, crying “liberty, [[freedom]],
opportunity—vouchsafe to us, o boastful [[world]], the [[chance]] of living
men!” to be sure, behind the [[thought]] lurks the afterthought,—suppose,
after all, the [[world]] is [[right]] and we are less than [[men]]? suppose this
mad impulse within is all [[wrong]], some mock mirage from the untrue?

so here we stand among thoughts [[thought]] of [[human]] unity, even through conquest
and [[slavery]]; the inferiority of black [[men]], even if forced by fraud; a
shriek in the night for the [[freedom]] of [[men]] who themselves are not yet
sure of their [[right]] to demand it. this is the tangle of [[thought]] and
afterthought wherein we are called to solve the problem of training men
for [[life]].

behind all its curiousness, so attractive alike to sage and
_dilettante_, [[lie]] its dim dangers, throwing across us shadows at once
grotesque and awful. plain it is to us that what the [[world]] seeks
through desert and wild we have within our threshold,—a stalwart
laboring [[force]], suited to the semi-tropics; if, deaf to the voice of
the zeitgeist, we refuse to use and develop these [[men]], we risk poverty
and loss. if, on the other hand, seized by the brutal afterthought, we
debauch the [[race]] thus caught in our talons, selfishly sucking their
blood and brains in the future as in the [[past]], what shall save us from
national decadence? only that saner selfishness, which education
teaches, can find the rights [[right]] of all in the whirl of [[work]].

again, we may decry the color-prejudice of the south, yet it remains a
heavy [[fact]]. such [[curious]] kinks of the [[human]] [[mind]] [[exist]] and must be
reckoned with soberly. they cannot be laughed away, nor always
successfully stormed at, nor easily abolished by act of legislature.
and yet they must not be encouraged by being let alone. they must be
recognized as facts [[fact]], but unpleasant facts [[fact]]; things that stand in the way
of [[civilization]] and [[religion]] and [[common]] decency. they can be met in but
one way,—by the breadth and broadening of [[human]] [[reason]], by catholicity
of taste and [[culture]]. and so, too, the native [[ambition]] and aspiration
of [[men]], even though they be black, backward, and ungraceful, must not
lightly be dealt with. to stimulate wildly [[weak]] and untrained minds [[mind]] is
to play with mighty fires [[fire]]; to flout their striving idly is to welcome a
harvest of brutish crime and shameless lethargy in our very laps. the
guiding of [[thought]] and the deft coordination of deed is at once the
path of [[honor]] and [[humanity]].

and so, in this [[great]] [[question]] of reconciling three vast and partially
contradictory streams of [[thought]], the one panacea of [[education]] leaps to
the lips of all:—such [[human]] training as will [[best]] use the labor of all
men without enslaving or brutalizing; such training as will give us
poise to encourage the prejudices that bulwark [[society]], and to stamp
out those that in sheer barbarity deafen us to the wail of prisoned
souls within the veil, and the mounting fury of shackled [[men]].

but when we have vaguely said that [[education]] will set this tangle
straight, what have we uttered but a truism? training for [[life]] teaches
living; but what training for the profitable living together of black
men and [[white]]? a hundred and fifty years ago our task would have seemed
easier. then dr. johnson blandly assured us that [[education]] was needful
solely for the embellishments of [[life]], and was useless for ordinary
vermin. to-day we have climbed to heights where we would open at least
the outer courts of [[knowledge]] to all, display its treasures to many,
and select the few to whom its mystery of [[truth]] is revealed, not wholly
by birth or the accidents of the stock market, but at least in part
according to deftness and aim, talent and [[character]]. this programme,
however, we are sorely puzzled in carrying out through that part of the
land where the blight of [[slavery]] fell hardest, and where we are dealing
with two backward peoples [[people]]. to make here in [[human]] [[education]] that ever
necessary combination of the permanent and the contingent—of the ideal
and the practical in workable equilibrium—has been there, as it ever
must be in every [[age]] and place, a matter of infinite experiment and
frequent mistakes.

in rough approximation we may point out four varying decades of [[work]] in
southern [[education]] since the civil [[war]]. from the close of the [[war]] until
1876, was the period of uncertain groping and temporary relief. there
were [[army]] schools, mission schools, and schools of the freedmen’s
bureau in chaotic disarrangement seeking [[system]] and co-operation. then
followed ten years of constructive definite effort toward the building
of complete school systems [[system]] in the south. normal schools and colleges
were founded for the freedmen, and teachers trained there to [[man]] the
public schools. there was the inevitable tendency of [[war]] to
underestimate the prejudices of the master and the ignorance of the
slave, and all seemed clear sailing out of the wreckage of the storm.
meantime, starting in this decade yet especially developing from 1885
to 1895, began the industrial [[revolution]] of the south. the [[land]] saw
glimpses of a new [[destiny]] and the stirring of new ideals. the
educational [[system]] striving to complete itself saw new obstacles and a
field of [[work]] ever broader and deeper. the negro colleges, hurriedly
founded, were inadequately equipped, illogically distributed, and of
varying efficiency and grade; the normal and high schools were doing
little more than common-school [[work]], and the [[common]] schools were
training but a third of the [[children]] who ought to be in them, and
training these too often poorly. at the same [[time]] the [[white]] south, by
reason of its sudden conversion from the [[slavery]] ideal, by so much the
more became set and strengthened in its racial prejudice, and
crystallized it into harsh [[law]] and harsher custom; while the marvellous
pushing forward of the [[poor]] [[white]] daily threatened to take even bread
and butter from the mouths of the heavily handicapped sons [[son]] of the
freedmen. in the midst, then, of the larger problem of negro education
sprang up the more practical [[question]] of [[work]], the inevitable economic
quandary that faces a [[people]] in the transition from [[slavery]] to [[freedom]],
and especially those who make that [[change]] amid hate and prejudice,
lawlessness and ruthless competition.

the industrial school springing to notice in this decade, but coming to
full recognition in the decade beginning with 1895, was the proffered
answer to this combined educational and economic crisis, and an answer
of singular [[wisdom]] and timeliness. from the very first in nearly all
the schools some attention had been given to training in handiwork, but
now was this training first raised to a [[dignity]] that brought it in
direct touch with the south’s magnificent industrial [[development]], and
given an emphasis which reminded black folk that before the temple of
knowledge swing the gates of toil.

yet after all they are but gates, and when turning our [[eyes]] from the
temporary and the contingent in the negro problem to the broader
question of the permanent uplifting and [[civilization]] of black [[men]] in
america, we have a [[right]] to inquire, as this enthusiasm for material
advancement mounts to its height, if after all the industrial school is
the final and sufficient [[answer]] in the training of the negro [[race]]; and
to ask gently, but in all sincerity, the ever-recurring query of the
ages, is not [[life]] more than meat, and the [[body]] more than raiment? and
men ask this to-day all the more eagerly because of sinister signs in
recent educational movements. the tendency is here, born of [[slavery]] and
quickened to renewed [[life]] by the crazy imperialism of the day, to
regard [[human]] beings as among the material resources of a [[land]] to be
trained with an eye [[single]] to future dividends. race-prejudices, which
keep brown and black [[men]] in their “places,” we are coming to regard as
useful allies with such a theory, no matter how much they may dull the
ambition and sicken the hearts [[heart]] of struggling [[human]] beings. and above
all, we daily hear that an [[education]] that encourages aspiration, that
sets the loftiest of ideals and seeks as an end [[culture]] and character
rather than bread-winning, is the [[privilege]] of [[white]] [[men]] and the danger
and delusion of black.

especially has criticism been directed against the former educational
efforts to aid the negro. in the four periods i have mentioned, we find
first, boundless, planless enthusiasm and [[sacrifice]]; then the
preparation of teachers for a vast public-school [[system]]; then the
launching and expansion of that school [[system]] amid increasing
difficulties; and finally the training of workmen for the new and
growing industries. this [[development]] has been sharply ridiculed as a
logical anomaly and flat reversal of [[nature]]. soothly we have been told
that first industrial and manual training should have taught the negro
to [[work]], then simple schools should have taught him to [[read]] and write,
and finally, after years, high and normal schools could have completed
the [[system]], as [[intelligence]] and [[wealth]] demanded.

that a [[system]] logically so complete was historically impossible, it
needs but a little [[thought]] to prove. [[progress]] in [[human]] affairs is more
often a pull than a push, a surging forward of the exceptional [[man]], and
the lifting of his duller brethren [[brother]] slowly and painfully to his
vantage-ground. thus it was no accident that gave birth to universities
centuries before the [[common]] schools, that made [[fair]] harvard the first
flower of our wilderness. so in the south: the mass of the freedmen at
the end of the [[war]] lacked the [[intelligence]] so necessary to modern
workingmen. they must first have the [[common]] school to [[teach]] them to
read, write, and cipher; and they must have higher schools to teach
teachers for the [[common]] schools. the [[white]] teachers who flocked south
went to establish such a common-school [[system]]. few held the [[idea]] of
founding colleges; most of them at first would have laughed at the
idea. but they faced, as all [[men]] since them have faced, that central
paradox of the south,—the social separation of the races [[race]]. at that time
it was the sudden volcanic rupture of nearly all relations between
black and [[white]], in [[work]] and [[government]] and [[family]] [[life]]. since then a
new adjustment of relations in economic and [[political]] affairs has grown
up,—an adjustment subtle and difficult to grasp, yet singularly
ingenious, which leaves still that frightful chasm at the color-line
across which [[men]] pass at their peril. thus, then and now, there stand
in the south two separate worlds [[world]]; and separate not simply in the higher
realms of social intercourse, but also in [[church]] and school, on railway
and street-car, in hotels and theatres, in streets and [[city]] sections,
in books [[book]] and newspapers, in asylums and jails, in hospitals and
graveyards. there is still enough of contact for large economic and
group cooperation, but the separation is so thorough and deep that it
absolutely precludes for the [[present]] between the races [[race]] anything like
that sympathetic and effective group-training and leadership of the one
by the other, such as the american negro and all backward peoples [[people]] must
have for effectual [[progress]].

this the missionaries of ’68 soon saw; and if effective industrial and
trade schools were impracticable before the establishment of a
common-school [[system]], just as certainly no adequate [[common]] schools
could be founded until there were teachers to [[teach]] them. southern
whites would not [[teach]] them; northern whites in sufficient numbers
could not be had. if the negro was to learn, he must [[teach]] himself, and
the most effective [[help]] that could be given him was the establishment
of schools to train negro teachers. this conclusion was slowly but
surely reached by every student of the situation until simultaneously,
in widely separated regions, without consultation or systematic plan,
there arose a series of [[institutions]] designed to furnish teachers for
the untaught. above the sneers of critics at the obvious defects of
this procedure must ever stand its one crushing rejoinder: in a single
generation they put thirty thousand black teachers in the south; they
wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of the black [[people]] of the
land, and they made tuskegee possible.

such higher training-schools tended naturally to deepen broader
development: at first they were [[common]] and grammar schools, then some
became high schools. and finally, by 1900, some thirty-four had one
year or more of studies of college grade. this [[development]] was reached
with different degrees [[degree]] of speed in different [[institutions]]: hampton is
still a high school, while fisk [[university]] started her college in 1871,
and spelman seminary about 1896. in all cases the aim was identical,—to
maintain the standards of the lower training by giving teachers and
leaders the [[best]] practicable training; and above all, to furnish the
black [[world]] with adequate standards of [[human]] [[culture]] and lofty ideals
of [[life]]. it was not enough that the teachers of teachers should be
trained in technical normal methods; they must also, so far as
possible, be broad-minded, cultured [[men]] and [[women]], to scatter
civilization among a [[people]] whose ignorance was not simply of letters,
but of [[life]] itself.

it can thus be seen that the [[work]] of [[education]] in the south began with
higher [[institutions]] of training, which threw off as their foliage
common schools, and later industrial schools, and at the same time
strove to shoot their roots ever deeper toward college and university
training. that this was an inevitable and necessary [[development]], sooner
or later, goes without saying; but there has been, and still is, a
question in many minds [[mind]] if the [[natural]] [[growth]] was not forced, and if the
higher training was not either overdone or done with cheap and unsound
methods. among [[white]] southerners this feeling is widespread and
positive. a prominent southern journal voiced this in a recent
editorial.

“the experiment that has been made to give the colored students
classical training has not been satisfactory. even though many were
able to pursue the course, most of them did so in a parrot-like way,
learning what was taught, but not seeming to appropriate the [[truth]] and
import of their instruction, and graduating without sensible aim or
valuable occupation for their future. the whole scheme has proved a
waste of [[time]], efforts, and the [[money]] of the [[state]].”


while most fair-minded [[men]] would recognize this as extreme and
overdrawn, still without [[doubt]] many are asking, are there a sufficient
number of negroes ready for college training to warrant the
undertaking? are not too many students prematurely forced into this
work? does it not have the effect of dissatisfying the [[young]] negro with
his environment? and do these graduates succeed in real [[life]]? such
natural questions [[question]] cannot be evaded, nor on the other hand must a nation
naturally skeptical as to negro ability assume an unfavorable answer
without careful inquiry and patient openness to conviction. we must not
forget that most americans [[answer]] all queries regarding the negro a
priori, and that the least that [[human]] courtesy can do is to listen to
evidence.

the advocates of the higher [[education]] of the negro would be the [[last]] to
deny the incompleteness and glaring defects of the [[present]] [[system]]: too
many [[institutions]] have attempted to do college [[work]], the [[work]] in some
cases has not been thoroughly done, and quantity rather than quality
has sometimes been sought. but all this can be said of higher education
throughout the [[land]]; it is the almost inevitable incident of
educational [[growth]], and leaves the deeper [[question]] of the legitimate
demand for the higher training of negroes untouched. and this latter
question can be settled in but one way,—by a first-hand study of the
facts. if we leave out of view all [[institutions]] which have not actually
graduated students from a course higher than that of a new [[england]] high
school, even though they be called colleges; if then we take the
thirty-four remaining [[institutions]], we may clear up many
misapprehensions by asking searchingly, what [[kind]] of [[institutions]] are
they? what do they [[teach]]? and what sort of [[men]] do they graduate?

and first we may say that this type of college, including atlanta,
fisk, and howard, wilberforce and claflin, shaw, and the rest, is
peculiar, almost unique. through the shining trees that whisper before
me as i write, i catch glimpses of a boulder of new [[england]] granite,
covering a grave, which graduates of atlanta [[university]] have placed
there,—

“grateful memory of their former teacher and friend and of the
unselfish [[life]] he lived, and the [[noble]] [[work]] he wrought; that they,
their [[children]], and their children’s [[children]] might be blessed.”


this was the gift of new [[england]] to the freed negro: not alms, but a
friend; not cash, but [[character]]. it was not and is not [[money]] these
seething millions want, but [[love]] and sympathy, the pulse of hearts
beating with red [[blood]];—a gift which to-day only their own kindred and
race can bring to the masses, but which once saintly souls [[soul]] brought to
their favored [[children]] in the crusade of the sixties, that finest thing
in american [[history]], and one of the few things untainted by sordid
greed and cheap vainglory. the teachers in these [[institutions]] came not
to keep the negroes in their place, but to raise them out of the
defilement of the places where [[slavery]] had wallowed them. the colleges
they founded were social settlements; homes [[home]] where the [[best]] of the sons
of the freedmen came in close and sympathetic touch with the best
traditions of new [[england]]. they lived and ate together, [[studied]] and
worked, hoped and harkened in the dawning [[light]]. in actual formal
content their curriculum was doubtless old-fashioned, but in
educational [[power]] it was supreme, for it was the contact of living
souls.

from such schools about two thousand negroes have gone forth with the
bachelor’s [[degree]]. the number in itself is enough to put at rest the
argument that too large a proportion of negroes are receiving higher
training. if the ratio to [[population]] of all negro students throughout
the [[land]], in both college and secondary training, be counted,
commissioner harris assures us “it must be increased to five times [[time]] its
present average” to [[equal]] the average of the [[land]].

fifty years ago the ability of negro students in any appreciable
numbers to master a [[modern]] college course would have been difficult to
prove. to-day it is proved by the [[fact]] that four hundred negroes, many
of whom have been reported as brilliant students, have received the
bachelor’s [[degree]] from harvard, yale, oberlin, and seventy other
leading colleges. here we have, then, nearly twenty-five hundred negro
graduates, of whom the crucial query must be made, how far did their
training fit them for [[life]]? it is of course extremely difficult to
collect satisfactory data on such a point,—difficult to reach the [[men]],
to get trustworthy testimony, and to gauge that testimony by any
generally acceptable criterion of [[success]]. in 1900, the conference at
atlanta [[university]] undertook to study these graduates, and published
the results. first they sought to [[know]] what these graduates were doing,
and succeeded in getting answers [[answer]] from nearly two-thirds of the living.
the direct testimony was in almost all cases corroborated by the
reports of the colleges where they graduated, so that in the main the
reports were worthy of credence. fifty-three per cent of these
graduates were teachers,—presidents of [[institutions]], heads of normal
schools, principals of [[city]] school-systems, and the like. seventeen per
cent were clergymen; another seventeen per cent were in the
professions, chiefly as physicians. over six per cent were merchants,
farmers, and artisans, and four per cent were in the government
civil-service. granting even that a considerable proportion of the
third unheard from are unsuccessful, this is a record of usefulness.
personally i [[know]] many hundreds of these graduates, and have
corresponded with more than a thousand; through others i have followed
carefully the life-work of scores; i have taught some of them and some
of the pupils whom they have taught, lived in homes [[home]] which they have
builded, and looked at [[life]] through their [[eyes]]. comparing them as a
class with my fellow students in new [[england]] and in [[europe]], i cannot
hesitate in saying that nowhere have i met [[men]] and [[women]] with a broader
spirit of helpfulness, with deeper devotion to their life-work, or with
more consecrated determination to succeed in the face of bitter
difficulties than among negro college-bred [[men]]. they have, to be sure,
their proportion of ne’er-do-wells, their pedants and lettered fools [[fool]],
but they have a surprisingly small proportion of them; they have not
that [[culture]] of manner which we instinctively associate with university
men, forgetting that in reality it is the heritage from cultured homes [[home]],
and that no [[people]] a [[generation]] removed from [[slavery]] can escape a
certain unpleasant rawness and gaucherie, despite the [[best]] of training.

with all their larger vision and deeper sensibility, these [[men]] have
usually been conservative, careful leaders. they have seldom been
agitators, have withstood the temptation to head the mob, and have
worked steadily and faithfully in a thousand communities [[community]] in the south.
as teachers, they have given the south a commendable [[system]] of city
schools and large numbers of private normal-schools and academies.
colored college-bred [[men]] have worked side by side with [[white]] college
graduates at hampton; almost from the beginning the backbone of
tuskegee’s teaching [[force]] has been formed of graduates from fisk and
atlanta. and to-day the institute is filled with college graduates,
from the energetic [[wife]] of the principal down to the teacher of
agriculture, including nearly half of the executive council and a
majority of the heads of departments. in the professions, college men
are slowly but surely leavening the negro [[church]], are healing and
preventing the devastations of disease, and beginning to furnish legal
protection for the [[liberty]] and [[property]] of the toiling masses. all this
is needful [[work]]. who would do it if negroes did not? how could negroes
do it if they were not trained carefully for it? if [[white]] [[people]] need
colleges to furnish teachers, ministers, lawyers, and doctors, do black
people need nothing of the sort?

if it is true that there are an appreciable number of negro [[youth]] in
the [[land]] capable by [[character]] and talent to receive that higher
training, the end of which is [[culture]], and if the two and a half
thousand who have had something of this training in the [[past]] have in
the main proved themselves useful to their [[race]] and [[generation]], the
question then comes, what place in the future [[development]] of the south
ought the negro college and college-bred [[man]] to occupy? that the
present social separation and acute race-sensitiveness must eventually
yield to the influences of [[culture]], as the south grows civilized, is
clear. but such transformation calls for singular [[wisdom]] and patience.
if, while the healing of this vast sore is progressing, the races [[race]] are
to [[live]] for many years side by side, [[united]] in economic effort, obeying
a [[common]] [[government]], sensitive to mutual [[thought]] and feeling, yet
subtly and silently separate in many matters of deeper human
intimacy,—if this unusual and dangerous [[development]] is to [[progress]] amid
peace and order, mutual [[respect]] and growing [[intelligence]], it will call
for social surgery at once the delicatest and nicest in [[modern]] [[history]].
it will demand broad-minded, upright [[men]], both [[white]] and black, and in
its final accomplishment american [[civilization]] will triumph. so far as
white [[men]] are concerned, this [[fact]] is to-day being recognized in the
south, and a [[happy]] renaissance of [[university]] [[education]] seems imminent.
but the very voices that cry hail to this [[good]] [[work]] are, [[strange]] to
relate, largely silent or antagonistic to the higher [[education]] of the
negro.

strange to relate! for this is [[certain]], no secure [[civilization]] can be
built in the south with the negro as an ignorant, turbulent
proletariat. suppose we seek to remedy this by making them laborers and
nothing more: they are not fools [[fool]], they have tasted of the tree of [[life]],
and they will not cease to [[think]], will not cease attempting to [[read]] the
riddle of the [[world]]. by taking away their [[best]] equipped teachers and
leaders, by slamming the door of opportunity in the faces of their
bolder and brighter minds [[mind]], will you make them satisfied with their lot?
or will you not rather transfer their leading from the hands of men
taught to [[think]] to the hands of untrained demagogues? we ought not to
forget that despite the pressure of [[poverty]], and despite the active
discouragement and even ridicule of [[friends]], the demand for higher
training steadily increases among negro [[youth]]: there were, in the years
from 1875 to 1880, 22 negro graduates from northern colleges; from 1885
to 1890 there were 43, and from 1895 to 1900, nearly 100 graduates.
from southern negro colleges there were, in the same three periods,
143, 413, and over 500 graduates. here, then, is the plain thirst for
training; by refusing to give this talented tenth the key to [[knowledge]],
can any sane [[man]] imagine that they will lightly lay aside their
yearning and contentedly become hewers of wood and drawers of water?

no. the dangerously clear [[logic]] of the negro’s position will more and
more loudly assert itself in that day when increasing [[wealth]] and more
intricate social organization preclude the south from being, as it so
largely is, simply an armed camp for intimidating black folk. such
waste of energy cannot be spared if the south is to catch up with
civilization. and as the black third of the [[land]] grows in thrift and
skill, unless skilfully guided in its larger [[philosophy]], it must more
and more brood over the red [[past]] and the creeping, crooked [[present]],
until it grasps a gospel of revolt and [[revenge]] and throws its new-found
energies athwart the current of advance. even to-day the masses of the
negroes see all too clearly the anomalies of their position and the
moral crookedness of yours. you may marshal [[strong]] indictments against
them, but their counter-cries, lacking though they be in formal [[logic]],
have burning truths [[truth]] within them which you may not wholly ignore, o
southern gentlemen! if you deplore their presence here, they ask, who
brought us? when you cry, deliver us from the vision of intermarriage,
they [[answer]] that legal [[marriage]] is infinitely [[better]] than systematic
concubinage and prostitution. and if in just fury you accuse their
vagabonds of violating [[women]], they also in fury quite as just may
reply: the rape which your gentlemen have done against helpless black
women in defiance of your own laws [[law]] is written on the foreheads of two
millions of mulattoes, and written in ineffaceable [[blood]]. and finally,
when you fasten crime upon this [[race]] as its peculiar trait, they answer
that [[slavery]] was the arch-crime, and lynching and lawlessness its twin
abortions; that color and [[race]] are not crimes, and yet it is they which
in this [[land]] receive most unceasing condemnation, north, east, south,
and west.

i will not say such arguments are wholly justified,—i will not insist
that there is no other side to the shield; but i do say that of the
nine millions of negroes in this nation, there is scarcely one out of
the cradle to whom these arguments do not daily [[present]] themselves in
the guise of terrible [[truth]]. i insist that the [[question]] of the future
is how [[best]] to keep these millions from brooding over the wrongs [[wrong]] of the
past and the difficulties of the [[present]], so that all their energies
may be bent toward a cheerful striving and cooperation with their white
neighbors toward a larger, juster, and fuller future. that one wise
method of doing this lies [[lie]] in the closer knitting of the negro to the
great industrial possibilities of the south is a [[great]] [[truth]]. and this
the [[common]] schools and the manual training and [[trade]] schools are
working to accomplish. but these alone are not enough. the foundations
of [[knowledge]] in this [[race]], as in others, must be sunk deep in the
college and [[university]] if we would build a solid, permanent structure.
internal problems of social advance must inevitably come, —problems of
work and wages, of families [[family]] and homes [[home]], of morals [[moral]] and the true valuing
of the things of [[life]]; and all these and other inevitable problems of
civilization the negro must meet and solve largely for himself, by
reason of his isolation; and can there be any possible solution other
than by study and [[thought]] and an appeal to the [[rich]] [[experience]] of the
past? is there not, with such a group and in such a crisis, infinitely
more danger to be apprehended from half-trained minds [[mind]] and shallow
thinking than from over-education and over-refinement? surely we have
wit enough to found a negro college so manned and equipped as to steer
successfully between the _dilettante_ and the [[fool]]. we shall hardly
induce black [[men]] to [[believe]] that if their stomachs be full, it matters
little about their brains. they already dimly perceive that the paths
of [[peace]] winding between honest toil and dignified manhood call for the
guidance of skilled thinkers, the loving, reverent comradeship between
the black lowly and the black [[men]] emancipated by training and [[culture]].

the function of the negro college, then, is clear: it must maintain the
standards of popular [[education]], it must seek the social regeneration of
the negro, and it must [[help]] in the solution of problems of [[race]] contact
and cooperation. and finally, beyond all this, it must develop [[men]].
above our [[modern]] socialism, and out of the [[worship]] of the mass, must
persist and evolve that higher individualism which the centres of
culture [[protect]]; there must come a loftier [[respect]] for the sovereign
human [[soul]] that seeks to [[know]] itself and the [[world]] about it; that seeks
a [[freedom]] for expansion and self-development; that will [[love]] and hate
and labor in its own way, untrammeled alike by old and new. such souls
aforetime have inspired and guided worlds [[world]], and if we be not wholly
bewitched by our rhinegold, they shall again. herein the longing of
black [[men]] must have [[respect]]: the [[rich]] and bitter depth of their
experience, the unknown treasures of their inner [[life]], the strange
rendings of [[nature]] they have seen, may give the [[world]] new points of
view and make their loving, living, and doing precious to all human
hearts. and to themselves in these the days that try their souls [[soul]], the
chance to soar in the dim blue air above the smoke is to their finer
spirits boon and guerdon for what they lose on [[earth]] by being black.

i sit with shakespeare and he winces not. across the color line i move
arm in arm with balzac and dumas, where smiling [[men]] and welcoming women
glide in gilded halls. from out the caves of evening that swing between
the strong-limbed [[earth]] and the tracery of the stars, i summon
aristotle and aurelius and what [[soul]] i will, and they come all
graciously with no scorn nor condescension. so, wed with [[truth]], i dwell
above the veil. is this the [[life]] you grudge us, o knightly [[america]]? is
this the [[life]] you long to [[change]] into the dull red hideousness of
georgia? are you so afraid lest peering from this high pisgah, between
philistine and amalekite, we sight the promised [[land]]?




vii.
of the black belt

i am black but comely, o ye daughters [[daughter]] of [[jerusalem]],
as the tents of kedar, as the curtains of solomon.
look not upon me, because i am black,
because the sun hath looked upon me:
my mother’s [[children]] were angry with me;
they made me the keeper of the vineyards;
but mine own vineyard have i not kept.

the [[song]] of solomon.

[illustration]


out of the north the train thundered, and we woke to see the crimson
soil of georgia stretching away bare and monotonous [[right]] and left.
here and there lay straggling, unlovely villages, and lean [[men]] loafed
leisurely at the depots; then again came the stretch of pines and clay.
yet we did not nod, nor weary of the scene; for this is historic
ground. [[right]] across our track, three hundred and sixty years ago,
wandered the cavalcade of hernando de soto, looking for gold and the
great sea; and he and his foot-sore captives disappeared yonder in the
grim forests to the west. here sits atlanta, the [[city]] of a hundred
hills, with something western, something southern, and something quite
its own, in its busy [[life]]. just this side atlanta is the [[land]] of the
cherokees and to the southwest, not far from where sam hose was
crucified, you may stand on a spot which is to-day the centre of the
negro problem,—the centre of those nine million [[men]] who are america’s
dark heritage from [[slavery]] and the slave-trade.

not only is georgia thus the geographical focus of our negro
population, but in many other respects [[respect]], both now and yesterday, the
negro problems have seemed to be centered in this [[state]]. no other state
in the union can count a million negroes among its [[citizens]],—a
population as large as the [[slave]] [[population]] of the whole union in 1800;
no other [[state]] fought so long and strenuously to gather this host of
africans. oglethorpe [[thought]] [[slavery]] against [[law]] and gospel; but the
circumstances which gave georgia its first inhabitants were not
calculated to furnish [[citizens]] over-nice in their ideas [[idea]] about rum and
slaves. despite the prohibitions of the trustees, these georgians, like
some of their descendants, proceeded to take the [[law]] into their own
hands; and so pliant were the judges [[judge]], and so flagrant the smuggling,
and so earnest were the prayers of whitefield, that by the middle of
the eighteenth century all restrictions were swept away, and the
slave-trade went merrily on for fifty years and more.

down in darien, where the delegal riots took place some summers ago,
there used to come a [[strong]] [[protest]] against [[slavery]] from the scotch
highlanders; and the moravians of ebenezer did not like the [[system]]. but
not till the haytian terror of toussaint was the [[trade]] in [[men]] even
checked; while the national statute of 1808 did not suffice to stop it.
how the africans poured in!—fifty thousand between 1790 and 1810, and
then, from virginia and from smugglers, two thousand a year for many
years more. so the thirty thousand negroes of georgia in 1790 doubled
in a decade,—were over a hundred thousand in 1810, had reached two
hundred thousand in 1820, and half a million at the [[time]] of the [[war]].
thus like a snake the black [[population]] writhed upward.

but we must hasten on our [[journey]]. this that we pass as we near atlanta
is the ancient [[land]] of the cherokees,—that brave [[indian]] nation which
strove so long for its fatherland, until [[fate]] and the [[united]] states
government drove them beyond the mississippi. if you [[wish]] to ride with
me you must come into the “jim crow car.” there will be no
objection,—already four other [[white]] [[men]], and a little [[white]] girl with
her nurse, are in there. usually the races [[race]] are mixed in there; but the
white coach is all [[white]]. of course this car is not so [[good]] as the
other, but it is fairly clean and comfortable. the discomfort lies
chiefly in the hearts [[heart]] of those four black [[men]] yonder—and in mine.

we rumble south in quite a business-like way. the bare red clay and
pines of northern georgia begin to disappear, and in their place
appears a [[rich]] rolling [[land]], luxuriant, and here and there well tilled.
this is the [[land]] of the creek indians [[indian]]; and a hard [[time]] the georgians
had to seize it. the towns grow more frequent and more interesting, and
brand-new cotton mills rise on every side. below macon the [[world]] grows
darker; for now we approach the black belt,—that [[strange]] [[land]] of
shadows, at which even slaves [[slave]] paled in the [[past]], and whence come now
only faint and half-intelligible murmurs to the [[world]] beyond. the “jim
crow car” grows larger and a shade [[better]]; three rough field-hands and
two or three [[white]] loafers accompany us, and the newsboy still spreads
his wares at one end. the sun is setting, but we can see the great
cotton [[country]] as we enter it,—the soil now dark and fertile, now thin
and gray, with fruit-trees and dilapidated buildings,—all the way to
albany.

at albany, in the [[heart]] of the black belt, we stop. two hundred miles
south of atlanta, two hundred miles west of the atlantic, and one
hundred miles north of the [[great]] gulf lies [[lie]] dougherty county, with ten
thousand negroes and two thousand whites. the flint river winds down
from andersonville, and, turning suddenly at albany, the county-seat,
hurries on to join the chattahoochee and the sea. andrew jackson knew
the flint well, and marched across it once to avenge the indian
massacre at fort mims. that was in 1814, not long before the [[battle]] of
new orleans; and by the creek treaty that followed this campaign, all
dougherty county, and much other [[rich]] [[land]], was ceded to georgia.
still, settlers fought shy of this [[land]], for the indians [[indian]] were all
about, and they were unpleasant neighbors in those days. the panic of
1837, which jackson bequeathed to van buren, turned the planters from
the impoverished lands [[land]] of virginia, the carolinas, and east georgia,
toward the west. the indians [[indian]] were removed to [[indian]] territory, and
settlers poured into these coveted lands [[land]] to retrieve their broken
fortunes. for a radius of a hundred miles about albany, stretched a
great fertile [[land]], luxuriant with forests of pine, oak, ash, hickory,
and poplar; hot with the sun and damp with the [[rich]] black swamp-land;
and here the corner-stone of the cotton [[kingdom]] was laid.

albany is to-day a wide-streeted, placid, southern town, with a broad
sweep of stores and saloons, and flanking rows of homes [[home]],—whites usually
to the north, and blacks to the south. six days in the week the town
looks decidedly too small for itself, and takes frequent and prolonged
naps. but on saturday suddenly the whole county disgorges itself upon
the place, and a [[perfect]] flood of black peasantry pours through the
streets, fills the stores, blocks the sidewalks, chokes the
thoroughfares, and takes full possession of the town. they are black,
sturdy, uncouth [[country]] folk, good-natured and simple, talkative to a
degree, and yet far more silent and brooding than the crowds of the
rhine-pfalz, or naples, or cracow. they drink considerable quantities
of whiskey, but do not get very drunk; they talk and laugh loudly at
times, but seldom quarrel or [[fight]]. they walk up and down the streets,
meet and gossip with [[friends]], stare at the shop windows, buy coffee,
cheap candy, and clothes, and at dusk drive home—happy? well no, not
exactly [[happy]], but much happier than as though they had not come.

thus albany is a real [[capital]],—a typical southern county town, the
centre of the [[life]] of ten thousand souls [[soul]]; their point of contact with
the outer [[world]], their centre of news and gossip, their market for
buying and selling, borrowing and lending, their fountain of justice
and [[law]]. once upon a [[time]] we knew [[country]] [[life]] so well and [[city]] [[life]] so
little, that we illustrated [[city]] [[life]] as that of a closely crowded
country district. now the [[world]] has well-nigh forgotten what the
country is, and we must imagine a little [[city]] of black [[people]] scattered
far and wide over three hundred lonesome square miles of [[land]], without
train or trolley, in the midst of cotton and corn, and wide patches of
sand and gloomy soil.

it gets pretty hot in southern georgia in july,—a sort of dull,
determined heat that seems quite independent of the sun; so it took us
some days to muster [[courage]] enough to leave the porch and venture out
on the long [[country]] roads, that we might see this unknown [[world]].
finally we started. it was about ten in the morning, bright with a
faint breeze, and we jogged leisurely southward in the valley of the
flint. we passed the scattered box-like cabins of the brickyard hands,
and the long tenement-row facetiously called “the ark,” and were soon
in the open [[country]], and on the confines of the [[great]] plantations of
other days. there is the “joe fields place”; a rough old fellow was he,
and had killed many a “nigger” in his day. twelve miles his plantation
used to run,—a regular barony. it is nearly all gone now; only
straggling bits belong to the [[family]], and the rest has passed to jews
and negroes. even the bits which are left are heavily mortgaged, and,
like the rest of the [[land]], tilled by tenants. here is one of them
now,—a tall brown [[man]], a hard worker and a hard drinker, illiterate,
but versed in farmlore, as his nodding crops declare. this
distressingly new board house is his, and he has just moved out of
yonder moss-grown cabin with its one square room.

from the curtains in benton’s house, down the road, a dark comely face
is staring at the strangers; for passing carriages are not every-day
occurrences here. benton is an [[intelligent]] yellow [[man]] with a good-sized
family, and manages a plantation blasted by the [[war]] and now the broken
staff of the widow. he might be well-to-do, they say; but he carouses
too much in albany. and the half-desolate spirit of neglect born of the
very soil seems to have settled on these acres. in times [[time]] [[past]] there
were cotton-gins and machinery here; but they have rotted away.

the whole [[land]] seems forlorn and forsaken. here are the remnants of the
vast plantations of the sheldons, the pellots, and the rensons; but the
souls of them are passed. the houses [[lie]] in half ruin, or have wholly
disappeared; the fences have flown, and the families [[family]] are wandering in
the [[world]]. [[strange]] vicissitudes have met these whilom masters. yonder
stretch the wide acres of bildad reasor; he died in war-time, but the
upstart overseer hastened to wed the widow. then he went, and his
neighbors too, and now only the black tenant remains; but the
shadow-hand of the master’s grand-nephew or cousin or creditor
stretches out of the gray distance to collect the rack-rent
remorselessly, and so the [[land]] is uncared-for and [[poor]]. only black
tenants can stand such a [[system]], and they only because they must. ten
miles we have ridden to-day and have seen no [[white]] face.

a resistless feeling of depression falls slowly upon us, despite the
gaudy sunshine and the green cottonfields. this, then, is the cotton
kingdom,—the shadow of a marvellous [[dream]]. and where is the [[king]]?
perhaps this is he,—the sweating ploughman, tilling his eighty acres
with two lean mules, and fighting a hard [[battle]] with debt. so we sit
musing, until, as we turn a corner on the sandy road, there comes a
fairer scene suddenly in view,—a neat cottage snugly ensconced by the
road, and near it a little store. a tall bronzed [[man]] rises from the
porch as we hail him, and comes out to our carriage. he is six feet in
height, with a sober face that smiles gravely. he walks too straight to
be a tenant,—yes, he owns two hundred and forty acres. “the [[land]] is run
down since the boom-days of eighteen hundred and fifty,” he explains,
and cotton is low. three black tenants [[live]] on his place, and in his
little store he keeps a small stock of tobacco, snuff, soap, and soda,
for the neighborhood. here is his gin-house with new machinery just
installed. three hundred bales of cotton went through it [[last]] year. two
children he has sent away to school. yes, he says sadly, he is getting
on, but cotton is down to four cents; i [[know]] how debt sits staring at
him.

wherever the [[king]] may be, the parks and palaces of the cotton kingdom
have not wholly disappeared. we plunge even now into [[great]] groves of
oak and towering pine, with an undergrowth of myrtle and shrubbery.
this was the “home-house” of the thompsons,—slave-barons who drove
their coach and four in the merry [[past]]. all is [[silence]] now, and ashes,
and tangled weeds. the owner put his whole [[fortune]] into the rising
cotton industry of the fifties, and with the falling prices of the
eighties he packed up and stole away. yonder is another grove, with
unkempt lawn, [[great]] magnolias, and grass-grown paths. the big house
stands in half-ruin, its [[great]] front door staring blankly at the
street, and the back part grotesquely restored for its black tenant. a
shabby, well-built negro he is, unlucky and irresolute. he digs hard to
pay rent to the [[white]] girl who owns the remnant of the place. she
married a policeman, and lives [[life]] in savannah.

now and again we come to churches [[church]]. here is one now,—shepherd’s, they
call it,—a [[great]] whitewashed barn of a thing, perched on stilts of
stone, and looking for all the [[world]] as though it were just resting
here a moment and might be expected to waddle off down the road at
almost any [[time]]. and yet it is the centre of a hundred cabin homes [[home]]; and
sometimes, of a sunday, five hundred persons [[person]] from far and near gather
here and talk and [[eat]] and sing. there is a schoolhouse near,—a very
airy, empty shed; but even this is an improvement, for usually the
school is held in the [[church]]. the churches [[church]] vary from log-huts to those
like shepherd’s, and the schools from nothing to this little house that
sits demurely on the county line. it is a tiny plank-house, perhaps ten
by twenty, and has within a double row of rough unplaned benches,
resting mostly on legs, sometimes on boxes. opposite the door is a
square home-made desk. in one corner are the ruins of a stove, and in
the other a dim blackboard. it is the cheerfulest schoolhouse i have
seen in dougherty, save in town. back of the schoolhouse is a
lodgehouse two stories high and not quite finished. societies [[society]] meet
there,—societies “to [[care]] for the sick and bury the dead’; and these
societies grow and flourish.

we had come to the boundaries of dougherty, and were about to turn west
along the county-line, when all these sights were pointed out to us by
a kindly old [[man]], black, white-haired, and seventy. forty-five years he
had lived here, and now supports himself and his old [[wife]] by the help
of the steer tethered yonder and the charity of his black neighbors. he
shows us the farm of the hills just across the county line in baker,—a
widow and two strapping sons [[son]], who raised ten bales (one need not add
“cotton” down here) [[last]] year. there are fences and pigs and cows, and
the soft-voiced, velvet-skinned [[young]] memnon, who sauntered
half-bashfully over to greet the strangers, is proud of his [[home]]. we
turn now to the west along the county line. [[great]] dismantled trunks of
pines tower above the green cottonfields, cracking their naked gnarled
fingers toward the border of living forest beyond. there is little
beauty in this region, only a sort of crude abandon that suggests
power,—a naked grandeur, as it were. the houses are bare and straight;
there are no hammocks or easy-chairs, and few flowers. so when, as here
at rawdon’s, one sees a vine clinging to a little porch, and home-like
windows peeping over the fences, one takes a long breath. i [[think]] i
never before quite realized the place of the fence in [[civilization]].
this is the [[land]] of the unfenced, where crouch on either hand scores of
ugly one-room cabins, cheerless and dirty. here lies [[lie]] the negro problem
in its naked dirt and penury. and here are no fences. but now and then
the crisscross rails or straight palings break into view, and then we
know a touch of [[culture]] is near. of course harrison gohagen,—a quiet
yellow [[man]], [[young]], smooth-faced, and diligent,—of course he is [[lord]] of
some hundred acres, and we expect to see a vision of well-kept rooms
and fat beds and laughing [[children]]. for has he not fine fences? and
those over yonder, why should they build fences on the rack-rented
land? it will only increase their rent.

on we wind, through sand and pines and glimpses of old plantations,
till there creeps into sight a cluster of buildings,—wood and brick,
mills and houses, and scattered cabins. it seemed quite a village. as
it came nearer and nearer, however, the aspect changed: the buildings
were rotten, the bricks were falling out, the mills were silent, and
the store was closed. only in the cabins appeared now and then a bit of
lazy [[life]]. i could imagine the place under some weird spell, and was
half-minded to search out the princess. an old ragged black [[man]],
honest, simple, and improvident, told us the tale. the wizard of the
north—the capitalist—had rushed down in the seventies to woo this coy
dark soil. he bought a square mile or more, and for a [[time]] the
field-hands sang, the gins groaned, and the mills buzzed. then came a
change. the agent’s [[son]] embezzled the funds and ran off with them. then
the agent himself disappeared. finally the new agent stole even the
books, and the company in wrath closed its [[business]] and its houses,
refused to sell, and let houses and furniture and machinery rust and
rot. so the waters-loring plantation was stilled by the spell of
dishonesty, and stands like some gaunt rebuke to a scarred [[land]].

somehow that plantation ended our day’s [[journey]]; for i could not shake
off the influence of that silent scene. back toward town we glided,
past the straight and thread-like pines, [[past]] a dark tree-dotted pond
where the air was heavy with a [[dead]] sweet perfume. [[white]] slender-legged
curlews flitted by us, and the garnet blooms of the cotton looked gay
against the green and purple stalks. a peasant girl was hoeing in the
field, white-turbaned and black-limbed. all this we saw, but the spell
still lay upon us.

how [[curious]] a [[land]] is this,—how full of untold story, of tragedy and
laughter, and the [[rich]] legacy of [[human]] [[life]]; shadowed with a tragic
past, and big with future promise! this is the black belt of georgia.
dougherty county is the west end of the black belt, and [[men]] once called
it the [[egypt]] of the confederacy. it is full of historic interest. first
there is the swamp, to the west, where the chickasawhatchee flows
sullenly southward. the shadow of an old plantation lies [[lie]] at its edge,
forlorn and dark. then comes the pool; pendent gray moss and brackish
waters appear, and forests filled with wildfowl. in one place the wood
is on [[fire]], smouldering in dull red anger; but nobody minds [[mind]]. then the
swamp grows beautiful; a raised road, built by chained negro convicts,
dips down into it, and forms a way walled and almost covered in living
green. spreading trees spring from a prodigal luxuriance of
undergrowth; [[great]] dark green shadows fade into the black background,
until all is one mass of tangled semi-tropical foliage, marvellous in
its weird savage splendor. once we crossed a black silent stream, where
the [[sad]] trees and writhing creepers, all glinting fiery yellow and
green, seemed like some vast cathedral,—some green milan builded of
wildwood. and as i crossed, i seemed to see again that fierce tragedy
of seventy years ago. osceola, the indian-negro chieftain, had risen in
the swamps of florida, vowing vengeance. his war-cry reached the red
creeks of dougherty, and their war-cry rang from the chattahoochee to
the sea. [[men]] and [[women]] and [[children]] fled and fell before them as they
swept into dougherty. in yonder shadows a dark and hideously painted
warrior glided stealthily on,—another and another, until three hundred
had crept into the [[treacherous]] swamp. then the false slime closing
about them called the [[white]] [[men]] from the east. waist-deep, they fought
beneath the tall trees, until the war-cry was hushed and the indians
glided back into the west. small wonder the wood is red.

then came the black slaves [[slave]]. day after day the clank of chained feet
marching from virginia and carolina to georgia was heard in these rich
swamp lands [[land]]. day after day the songs [[song]] of the callous, the wail of the
motherless, and the muttered curses of the wretched echoed from the
flint to the chickasawhatchee, until by 1860 there had risen in west
dougherty perhaps the richest [[slave]] [[kingdom]] the [[modern]] [[world]] ever knew.
a hundred and fifty barons commanded the labor of nearly six thousand
negroes, held sway over farms with ninety thousand acres tilled [[land]],
valued even in times [[time]] of cheap soil at three millions of dollars. twenty
thousand bales of ginned cotton went yearly to [[england]], new and old;
and [[men]] that came there bankrupt made [[money]] and grew [[rich]]. in a single
decade the cotton output increased four-fold and the value of lands [[land]] was
tripled. it was the heyday of the _nouveau riche_, and a [[life]] of
careless extravagance among the masters. four and six bobtailed
thoroughbreds rolled their coaches to town; open hospitality and gay
entertainment were the [[rule]]. parks and groves were laid out, [[rich]] with
flower and vine, and in the midst stood the low wide-halled “big
house,” with its porch and columns and [[great]] fireplaces.

and yet with all this there was something sordid, something forced,—a
certain feverish unrest and recklessness; for was not all this show and
tinsel built upon a groan? “this [[land]] was a little hell,” said a
ragged, brown, and grave-faced [[man]] to me. we were seated near a
roadside blacksmith shop, and behind was the bare ruin of some master’s
home. “i’ve seen niggers drop [[dead]] in the furrow, but they were kicked
aside, and the plough never stopped. down in the guard-house, there’s
where the [[blood]] ran.”

with such foundations a [[kingdom]] must in [[time]] sway and fall. the masters
moved to macon and augusta, and left only the irresponsible overseers
on the [[land]]. and the result is such ruin as this, the lloyd
“home-place’:—great waving oaks, a spread of lawn, myrtles and
chestnuts, all ragged and wild; a solitary gate-post standing where
once was a castle entrance; an old rusty anvil lying amid rotting
bellows and wood in the ruins of a blacksmith shop; a wide rambling old
mansion, brown and dingy, filled now with the grandchildren of the
slaves who once waited on its tables; while the [[family]] of the master
has dwindled to two lone [[women]], who [[live]] in macon and feed hungrily off
the remnants of an earldom. so we ride on, [[past]] phantom gates and
falling homes [[home]],—past the once flourishing farms of the smiths, the
gandys, and the lagores,—and find all dilapidated and half ruined, even
there where a solitary [[white]] woman, a relic of other days, sits alone
in [[state]] among miles of negroes and rides to town in her ancient coach
each day.

this was indeed the [[egypt]] of the confederacy,—the [[rich]] granary whence
potatoes and corn and cotton poured out to the famished and ragged
confederate [[troops]] as they battled for a cause lost long before 1861.
sheltered and secure, it became the place of refuge for families [[family]],
wealth, and slaves [[slave]]. yet even then the hard ruthless rape of the land
began to tell. the red-clay sub-soil already had begun to peer above
the loam. the harder the slaves [[slave]] were driven the more careless and fatal
was their farming. then came the [[revolution]] of [[war]] and emancipation,
the bewilderment of reconstruction,—and now, what is the [[egypt]] of the
confederacy, and what meaning has it for the nation’s weal or woe?

it is a [[land]] of rapid contrasts and of curiously mingled [[hope]] and [[pain]].
here sits a pretty blue-eyed quadroon hiding her bare feet; she was
married only [[last]] week, and yonder in the field is her dark young
husband, hoeing to support her, at thirty cents a day without board.
across the way is gatesby, brown and tall, [[lord]] of two thousand acres
shrewdly won and held. there is a store conducted by his black [[son]], a
blacksmith shop, and a ginnery. five miles below here is a town owned
and controlled by one [[white]] new englander. he owns almost a rhode
island county, with thousands of acres and hundreds of black laborers.
their cabins look [[better]] than most, and the farm, with machinery and
fertilizers, is much more business-like than any in the county,
although the manager drives hard bargains in wages. when now we turn
and look five miles above, there on the edge of town are five houses of
prostitutes,—two of blacks and three of whites; and in one of the
houses of the whites a worthless black boy was harbored too openly two
years ago; so he was [[hanged]] for rape. and here, too, is the high
whitewashed fence of the “stockade,” as the county prison is called;
the [[white]] folks say it is ever full of black criminals [[criminal]],—the black folks
say that only colored boys are sent to jail, and they not because they
are guilty, but because the [[state]] needs criminals [[criminal]] to eke out its income
by their forced labor.

immigrants are heirs of the [[slave]] baron in dougherty; and as we ride
westward, by wide stretching cornfields and stubby orchards of peach
and pear, we see on all sides within the circle of dark forest a land
of canaan. here and there are tales of projects for money-getting, born
in the swift days of reconstruction,—‘improvement’ companies, wine
companies, mills and factories; most failed, and foreigners fell heir.
it is a beautiful [[land]], this dougherty, west of the flint. the forests
are wonderful, the solemn pines have disappeared, and this is the
“oakey woods,” with its [[wealth]] of hickories, beeches, oaks and
palmettos. but a pall of debt hangs over the beautiful [[land]]; the
merchants are in debt to the wholesalers, the planters are in debt to
the merchants, the tenants owe the planters, and laborers bow and bend
beneath the burden of it all. here and there a [[man]] has raised his head
above these murky waters. we passed one fenced stock-farm with grass
and grazing cattle, that looked very home-like after endless corn and
cotton. here and there are black free-holders: there is the gaunt
dull-black jackson, with his hundred acres. “i says, ‘look up! if you
don’t look up you can’t get up,’” remarks jackson, philosophically. and
he’s gotten up. dark carter’s neat barns would do credit to new
england. his master helped him to get a start, but when the black man
died [[last]] fall the master’s sons [[son]] immediately laid claim to the estate.
“and them [[white]] folks will get it, too,” said my yellow gossip.

i turn from these well-tended acres with a comfortable feeling that the
negro is rising. even then, however, the fields, as we proceed, begin
to redden and the trees disappear. rows of old cabins appear filled
with renters and laborers,—cheerless, bare, and dirty, for the most
part, although here and there the very [[age]] and decay makes the scene
picturesque. a [[young]] black fellow greets us. he is twenty-two, and just
married. until [[last]] year he had [[good]] [[luck]] renting; then cotton fell,
and the sheriff seized and sold all he had. so he moved here, where the
rent is higher, the [[land]] poorer, and the owner inflexible; he rents a
forty-dollar mule for twenty dollars a year. [[poor]] lad!—a [[slave]] at
twenty-two. this plantation, owned now by a foreigner, was a part of
the famous bolton estate. after the [[war]] it was for many years worked by
gangs of negro convicts,—and black convicts then were even more
plentiful than now; it was a way of making negroes [[work]], and the
question of guilt was a minor one. hard tales of [[cruelty]] and
mistreatment of the chained freemen are told, but the county
authorities were deaf until the free-labor market was nearly ruined by
wholesale migration. then they took the convicts from the plantations,
but not until one of the fairest regions of the “oakey woods” had been
ruined and ravished into a red waste, out of which only a yankee or an
immigrant could squeeze more [[blood]] from debt-cursed tenants.

no wonder that luke black, slow, dull, and discouraged, shuffles to our
carriage and talks hopelessly. why should he strive? every year finds
him deeper in debt. how [[strange]] that georgia, the world-heralded refuge
of [[poor]] debtors, should bind her own to sloth and misfortune as
ruthlessly as ever [[england]] did! the [[poor]] [[land]] groans with its
birth-pains, and brings forth scarcely a hundred pounds of cotton to
the acre, where fifty years ago it yielded eight times [[time]] as much. of his
meagre yield the tenant pays [[pay]] from a quarter to a third in rent, and
most of the rest in interest on food and supplies bought on credit.
twenty years yonder sunken-cheeked, old black [[man]] has labored under
that [[system]], and now, turned day-laborer, is supporting his [[wife]] and
boarding himself on his wages of a dollar and a half a week, received
only part of the year.

the bolton convict farm formerly included the neighboring plantation.
here it was that the convicts were lodged in the [[great]] log prison still
standing. a dismal place it still remains, with rows of ugly huts
filled with surly ignorant tenants. “what rent do you [[pay]] here?” i
inquired. “i don’t [[know]],—what is it, sam?” “all we make,” answered sam.
it is a depressing place,—bare, unshaded, with no charm of past
association, only a memory of forced [[human]] toil,—now, then, and before
the [[war]]. they are not [[happy]], these black [[men]] whom we meet throughout
this region. there is little of the joyous abandon and playfulness
which we are wont to associate with the plantation negro. at [[best]], the
natural good-nature is edged with complaint or has changed into
sullenness and gloom. and now and then it blazes forth in veiled but
hot anger. i [[remember]] one big red-eyed black whom we met by the
roadside. forty-five years he had labored on this farm, beginning with
nothing, and still having nothing. to be sure, he had given four
children a common-school training, and perhaps if the new fence-law had
not allowed unfenced crops in west dougherty he might have raised a
little stock and kept ahead. as it is, he is hopelessly in debt,
disappointed, and embittered. he stopped us to inquire after the black
boy in albany, whom it was said a policeman had shot and killed for
loud talking on the sidewalk. and then he said slowly: “let a [[white]] man
touch me, and he dies; i don’t boast this,—i don’t say it around loud,
or before the [[children]],—but i mean it. i’ve seen them whip my father
and my old [[mother]] in them cotton-rows till the [[blood]] ran; by—” and we
passed on.

now sears, whom we met next lolling under the chubby oak-trees, was of
quite different fibre. [[happy]]?—well, yes; he laughed and flipped
pebbles, and [[thought]] the [[world]] was as it was. he had worked here twelve
years and has nothing but a mortgaged mule. [[children]]? yes, seven; but
they hadn’t been to school this year,—couldn’t afford books [[book]] and
clothes, and couldn’t spare their [[work]]. there go part of them to the
fields now,—three big boys astride mules, and a strapping girl with
bare brown legs. careless ignorance and laziness here, fierce hate and
vindictiveness there;—these are the extremes of the negro problem which
we met that day, and we scarce knew which we preferred.

here and there we meet distinct characters [[character]] quite out of the ordinary.
one came out of a piece of newly cleared ground, making a wide detour
to avoid the snakes. he was an old, hollow-cheeked [[man]], with a drawn
and characterful brown face. he had a sort of self-contained quaintness
and rough humor impossible to describe; a [[certain]] cynical earnestness
that puzzled one. “the niggers were [[jealous]] of me over on the other
place,” he said, “and so me and the old woman begged this piece of
woods, and i cleared it up myself. made nothing for two years, but i
reckon i’ve got a crop now.” the cotton looked tall and [[rich]], and we
praised it. he curtsied low, and then bowed almost to the ground, with
an imperturbable gravity that seemed almost suspicious. then he
continued, “my mule died [[last]] week,”—a calamity in this [[land]] [[equal]] to a
devastating [[fire]] in town,—‘but a [[white]] [[man]] loaned me another.” then he
added, eyeing us, “oh, i gets along with [[white]] folks.” we turned the
conversation. “bears? deer?” he answered, “well, i should say there
were,” and he let fly a string of brave oaths, as he told hunting-tales
of the swamp. we left him standing still in the middle of the road
looking after us, and yet apparently not noticing us.

the whistle place, which includes his bit of [[land]], was bought soon
after the [[war]] by an english syndicate, the “dixie cotton and corn
company.” a marvellous deal of style their factor put on, with his
servants and coach-and-six; so much so that the concern soon landed in
inextricable bankruptcy. nobody lives [[life]] in the old house now, but a man
comes each winter out of the north and collects his high rents. i know
not which are the more touching,—such old empty houses, or the homes [[home]] of
the masters’ sons [[son]]. [[sad]] and bitter tales [[lie]] hidden back of those white
doors,—tales of [[poverty]], of struggle, of disappointment. a revolution
such as that of ’63 is a terrible thing; they that rose [[rich]] in the
morning often slept in paupers’ beds. beggars and vulgar speculators
rose to [[rule]] over them, and their [[children]] went astray. see yonder
sad-colored house, with its cabins and fences and glad crops! it is not
glad within; [[last]] month the prodigal [[son]] of the struggling [[father]] wrote
home from the [[city]] for [[money]]. money! where was it to come from? and so
the [[son]] rose in the night and killed his baby, and killed his [[wife]], and
shot himself [[dead]]. and the [[world]] passed on.

i [[remember]] wheeling around a bend in the road beside a graceful bit of
forest and a singing brook. a long low house faced us, with porch and
flying pillars, [[great]] oaken door, and a broad lawn shining in the
evening sun. but the window-panes were gone, the pillars were
worm-eaten, and the moss-grown roof was falling in. half curiously i
peered through the unhinged door, and saw where, on the wall across the
hall, was written in once [[gay]] letters a faded “welcome.”

quite a contrast to the southwestern part of dougherty county is the
northwest. soberly timbered in oak and pine, it has none of that
half-tropical luxuriance of the southwest. then, too, there are fewer
signs of a romantic [[past]], and more of systematic [[modern]] land-grabbing
and money-getting. [[white]] [[people]] are more in evidence here, and farmer
and hired labor replace to some extent the absentee landlord and
rack-rented tenant. the crops have neither the luxuriance of the richer
land nor the signs of neglect so often seen, and there were fences and
meadows here and there. most of this [[land]] was [[poor]], and beneath the
notice of the slave-baron, before the [[war]]. since then his poor
relations and [[foreign]] immigrants have seized it. the returns of the
farmer are too small to allow much for wages, and yet he will not sell
off small farms. there is the negro sanford; he has worked fourteen
years as overseer on the ladson place, and “paid out enough for
fertilizers to have bought a farm,” but the owner will not sell off a
few acres.

two children—a boy and a girl—are hoeing sturdily in the fields on the
farm where corliss works [[work]]. he is smooth-faced and brown, and is fencing
up his pigs. he used to run a successful cotton-gin, but the cotton
seed [[oil]] trust has forced the price of ginning so low that he says it
hardly pays [[pay]] him. he points out a stately old house over the way as the
home of “pa willis.” we eagerly ride over, for “pa willis” was the tall
and powerful black [[moses]] who [[led]] the negroes for a [[generation]], and led
them well. he was a baptist preacher, and when he died, two thousand
black [[people]] followed him to the grave; and now they preach his funeral
sermon each year. his widow lives [[life]] here,—a weazened, sharp-featured
little woman, who curtsied quaintly as we greeted her. further on lives
jack delson, the most prosperous negro [[farmer]] in the county. it is a
joy to meet him,—a [[great]] broad-shouldered, handsome black [[man]],
intelligent and jovial. six hundred and fifty acres he owns, and has
eleven black tenants. a neat and tidy [[home]] nestled in a flower-garden,
and a little store stands beside it.

we pass the munson place, where a plucky [[white]] widow is renting and
struggling; and the eleven hundred acres of the sennet plantation, with
its negro overseer. then the [[character]] of the farms begins to [[change]].
nearly all the lands [[land]] belong to russian [[jews]]; the overseers are [[white]],
and the cabins are bare board-houses scattered here and there. the
rents are high, and day-laborers and “contract” hands abound. it is a
keen, hard struggle for living here, and few have [[time]] to talk. tired
with the long ride, we gladly drive into gillonsville. it is a silent
cluster of farmhouses standing on the crossroads, with one of its
stores closed and the other kept by a negro preacher. they tell great
tales of busy times [[time]] at gillonsville before all the railroads came to
albany; now it is chiefly a memory. riding down the street, we stop at
the preacher’s and seat ourselves before the door. it was one of those
scenes one cannot soon forget:—a wide, low, little house, whose
motherly roof reached over and sheltered a snug little porch. there we
sat, after the long hot drive, drinking cool water,—the talkative
little storekeeper who is my daily companion; the silent old black
woman patching pantaloons and saying never a word; the ragged picture
of helpless misfortune who called in just to see the preacher; and
finally the neat matronly preacher’s [[wife]], plump, yellow, and
intelligent. “own [[land]]?” said the [[wife]]; “well, only this house.” then
she added quietly. “we did buy seven hundred acres across up yonder,
and paid for it; but they cheated us out of it. sells was the owner.”
“sells!” echoed the ragged misfortune, who was leaning against the
balustrade and listening, “he’s a regular [[cheat]]. i worked for him
thirty-seven days this spring, and he paid me in cardboard checks which
were to be cashed at the end of the month. but he never cashed
them,—kept putting me off. then the sheriff came and took my mule and
corn and furniture—” “furniture? but furniture is exempt from seizure
by [[law]].” “well, he took it just the same,” said the hard-faced [[man]].




viii.
of the quest of the golden fleece

but the brute said in his breast, “till the mills i grind have ceased,
the riches [[rich]] shall be dust of dust, dry ashes be the feast!


    “on the [[strong]] and cunning few
    cynic favors i will strew;
i will stuff their maw with overplus until their spirit dies;
    from the patient and the low
    i will take the joys they [[know]];
    they shall [[hunger]] after vanities and still an-hungered go.
madness shall be on the [[people]], ghastly jealousies arise;
brother’s [[blood]] shall cry on [[brother]] up the [[dead]] and empty skies [[sky]].”

william vaughn moody.

[illustration]


have you ever seen a cotton-field [[white]] with harvest,—its golden fleece
hovering above the black [[earth]] like a silvery cloud edged with dark
green, its bold [[white]] signals waving like the foam of billows from
carolina to texas across that black and [[human]] sea? i have sometimes
half suspected that here the winged ram chrysomallus left that fleece
after which jason and his argonauts went vaguely wandering into the
shadowy east three thousand years ago; and certainly one might frame a
pretty and not far-fetched analogy of witchery and dragons’ teeth, and
blood and armed [[men]], between the ancient and the [[modern]] quest of the
golden fleece in the black sea.

and now the golden fleece is found; not only found, but, in its
birthplace, woven. for the hum of the cotton-mills is the newest and
most significant thing in the new south to-day. all through the
carolinas and georgia, away down to mexico, rise these gaunt red
buildings, bare and homely, and yet so busy and noisy withal that they
scarce seem to belong to the slow and sleepy [[land]]. perhaps they sprang
from dragons’ teeth. so the cotton [[kingdom]] still lives [[life]]; the [[world]] still
bows beneath her sceptre. even the markets that once defied the parvenu
have crept one by one across the seas, and then slowly and reluctantly,
but surely, have started toward the black belt.

to be sure, there are those who wag their heads knowingly and tell us
that the [[capital]] of the cotton [[kingdom]] has moved from the black to the
white belt,—that the negro of to-day raises not more than half of the
cotton crop. such [[men]] forget that the cotton crop has doubled, and more
than doubled, since the era of [[slavery]], and that, even granting their
contention, the negro is still supreme in a cotton [[kingdom]] larger than
that on which the confederacy builded its hopes [[hope]]. so the negro forms
to-day one of the [[chief]] figures in a [[great]] world-industry; and this,
for its own sake, and in the [[light]] of historic interest, makes the
field-hands of the cotton [[country]] worth studying.

we seldom study the condition of the negro to-day honestly and
carefully. it is so much easier to assume that we [[know]] it all. or
perhaps, having already reached conclusions in our own minds [[mind]], we are
loth to have them disturbed by facts [[fact]]. and yet how little we really know
of these millions,—of their daily lives [[life]] and longings, of their homely
joys and sorrows [[sorrow]], of their real shortcomings and the meaning of their
crimes! all this we can only learn by intimate contact with the masses,
and not by wholesale arguments covering millions separate in [[time]] and
space, and differing widely in training and [[culture]]. to-day, then, my
reader, let us turn our faces to the black belt of georgia and seek
simply to [[know]] the condition of the black farm-laborers of one county
there.

here in 1890 lived ten thousand negroes and two thousand whites. the
country is [[rich]], yet the [[people]] are [[poor]]. the keynote of the black belt
is debt; not commercial credit, but debt in the sense of continued
inability on the part of the mass of the [[population]] to make income
cover expense. this is the direct heritage of the south from the
wasteful economies of the [[slave]] _régime;_ but it was emphasized and
brought to a crisis by the emancipation of the slaves [[slave]]. in 1860,
dougherty county had six thousand slaves [[slave]], worth at least two and a half
millions of dollars; its farms were estimated at three millions,—making
five and a half millions of [[property]], the value of which depended
largely on the [[slave]] [[system]], and on the speculative demand for land
once marvellously [[rich]] but already partially devitalized by careless
and exhaustive [[culture]]. the [[war]] then meant a financial crash; in place
of the five and a half millions of 1860, there remained in 1870 only
farms valued at less than two millions. with this came increased
competition in cotton [[culture]] from the [[rich]] lands [[land]] of texas; a steady
fall in the normal price of cotton followed, from about fourteen cents
a pound in 1860 until it reached four cents in 1898. such a financial
revolution was it that involved the owners of the cotton-belt in debt.
and if things went ill with the master, how fared it with the [[man]]?

the plantations of dougherty county in [[slavery]] days were not as
imposing and aristocratic as those of virginia. the big house was
smaller and usually one-storied, and sat very near the [[slave]] cabins.
sometimes these cabins stretched off on either side like wings;
sometimes only on one side, forming a double row, or edging the road
that turned into the plantation from the main thoroughfare. the form
and disposition of the laborers’ cabins throughout the black belt is
to-day the same as in [[slavery]] days. some [[live]] in the self-same cabins,
others in cabins rebuilt on the sites of the old. all are sprinkled in
little groups over the face of the [[land]], centering about some
dilapidated big house where the head-tenant or agent lives [[life]]. the general
character and arrangement of these dwellings remains on the whole
unaltered. there were in the county, outside the corporate town of
albany, about fifteen hundred negro families [[family]] in 1898. out of all these,
only a [[single]] [[family]] occupied a house with seven rooms; only fourteen
have five rooms or more. the mass [[live]] in one- and two-room homes [[home]].

the size and arrangements of a people’s homes [[home]] are no unfair index of
their condition. if, then, we inquire more carefully into these negro
homes, we find much that is unsatisfactory. all over the face of the
land is the one-room cabin,—now standing in the shadow of the big
house, now staring at the dusty road, now rising dark and sombre amid
the green of the cotton-fields. it is nearly always old and bare, built
of rough boards, and neither plastered nor ceiled. [[light]] and
ventilation are supplied by the [[single]] door and by the square hole in
the wall with its wooden shutter. there is no glass, porch, or
ornamentation without. within is a fireplace, black and smoky, and
usually unsteady with [[age]]. a bed or two, a table, a wooden chest, and a
few chairs compose the furniture; while a stray show-bill or a
newspaper makes up the decorations for the walls. now and then one may
find such a cabin kept scrupulously neat, with merry steaming
fireplaces and hospitable door; but the majority are dirty and
dilapidated, smelling of eating and sleeping, poorly ventilated, and
anything but homes [[home]].

above all, the cabins are crowded. we have come to associate crowding
with homes [[home]] in cities [[city]] almost exclusively. this is primarily because we
have so little accurate [[knowledge]] of [[country]] [[life]]. here in dougherty
county one may find families [[family]] of eight and ten occupying one or two
rooms, and for every ten rooms of house accommodation for the negroes
there are twenty-five persons [[person]]. the worst tenement abominations of new
york do not have above twenty-two persons [[person]] for every ten rooms. of
course, one small, close room in a [[city]], without a yard, is in many
respects worse than the larger [[single]] [[country]] room. in other respects
it is [[better]]; it has glass windows, a decent chimney, and a trustworthy
floor. the [[single]] [[great]] advantage of the negro peasant is that he may
spend most of his [[life]] outside his hovel, in the open fields.

there are four [[chief]] causes of these wretched homes [[home]]: first, long custom
born of [[slavery]] has assigned such homes [[home]] to negroes; [[white]] laborers
would be offered [[better]] accommodations, and might, for that and similar
reasons, give [[better]] [[work]]. secondly, the negroes, used to such
accommodations, do not as a [[rule]] demand [[better]]; they do not [[know]] what
better houses mean. thirdly, the landlords as a class have not yet come
to realize that it is a [[good]] [[business]] investment to raise the standard
of living among labor by slow and judicious methods; that a negro
laborer who demands three rooms and fifty cents a day would give more
efficient [[work]] and leave a larger [[profit]] than a discouraged toiler
herding his [[family]] in one room and working for thirty cents. lastly,
among such conditions of [[life]] there are few incentives to make the
laborer become a [[better]] [[farmer]]. if he is ambitious, he moves to town or
tries other labor; as a tenant-farmer his outlook is almost hopeless,
and following it as a makeshift, he takes the house that is given him
without [[protest]].

in such homes [[home]], then, these negro peasants [[live]]. the families [[family]] are both
small and large; there are many [[single]] tenants,—widows and bachelors,
and remnants of broken groups. the [[system]] of labor and the size of the
houses both tend to the breaking up of [[family]] groups: the grown
children go away as contract hands or migrate to town, the sister goes
into service; and so one finds many families [[family]] with hosts of babies, and
many newly [[married]] couples, but comparatively few families [[family]] with
half-grown and grown sons [[son]] and daughters [[daughter]]. the average size of negro
families has undoubtedly decreased since the [[war]], primarily from
economic stress. in russia over a third of the bridegrooms and over
half the brides are under twenty; the same was true of the antebellum
negroes. today, however, very few of the boys and less than a fifth of
the negro girls under twenty are [[married]]. the [[young]] [[men]] [[marry]] between
the ages [[age]] of twenty-five and thirty-five; the [[young]] [[women]] between twenty
and thirty. such postponement is due to the difficulty of earning
sufficient to rear and support a [[family]]; and it undoubtedly leads, in
the [[country]] districts, to [[sexual]] immorality. the form of this
immorality, however, is very seldom that of prostitution, and less
frequently that of illegitimacy than one would imagine. rather, it
takes the form of separation and desertion after a [[family]] group has
been formed. the number of separated persons [[person]] is thirty-five to the
thousand,—a very large number. it would of course be unfair to compare
this number with divorce statistics, for many of these separated women
are in reality widowed, were the [[truth]] known, and in other cases the
separation is not permanent. nevertheless, here lies [[lie]] the seat of
greatest [[moral]] danger. there is little or no prostitution among these
negroes, and over three-fourths of the families [[family]], as found by
house-to-house investigation, deserve to be classed as decent people
with considerable regard for female chastity. to be sure, the ideas [[idea]] of
the mass would not suit new [[england]], and there are many loose habits
and notions. yet the rate of illegitimacy is undoubtedly lower than in
austria or [[italy]], and the [[women]] as a class are modest. the plague-spot
in [[sexual]] relations is easy [[marriage]] and easy separation. this is no
sudden [[development]], nor the fruit of emancipation. it is the plain
heritage from [[slavery]]. in those days sam, with his master’s [[consent]],
“took up” with [[mary]]. no [[ceremony]] was necessary, and in the busy [[life]] of
the [[great]] plantations of the black belt it was usually dispensed with.
if now the master needed sam’s [[work]] in another plantation or in another
part of the same plantation, or if he took a notion to sell the [[slave]],
sam’s [[married]] [[life]] with [[mary]] was usually unceremoniously broken, and
then it was clearly to the master’s interest to have both of them take
new mates. this widespread custom of two centuries has not been
eradicated in thirty years. to-day sam’s grandson “takes up” with a
woman without license or [[ceremony]]; they [[live]] together decently and
honestly, and are, to all intents and purposes [[purpose]], [[man]] and [[wife]]. sometimes
these unions are never broken until [[death]]; but in too many cases family
quarrels, a roving spirit, a rival suitor, or perhaps more frequently
the hopeless [[battle]] to support a [[family]], lead to separation, and a
broken household is the result. the negro [[church]] has done much to stop
this practice, and now most [[marriage]] ceremonies [[ceremony]] are performed by the
pastors. nevertheless, the [[evil]] is still deep seated, and only a
general raising of the standard of living will finally cure it.

looking now at the county black [[population]] as a whole, it is [[fair]] to
characterize it as [[poor]] and ignorant. perhaps ten per cent compose the
well-to-do and the [[best]] of the laborers, while at least nine per cent
are thoroughly lewd and vicious. the rest, over eighty per cent, are
poor and ignorant, fairly honest and well meaning, plodding, and to a
degree shiftless, with some but not [[great]] [[sexual]] looseness. such class
lines are by no means fixed; they vary, one might almost say, with the
price of cotton. the [[degree]] of ignorance cannot easily be expressed. we
may say, for instance, that nearly two-thirds of them cannot [[read]] or
write. this but partially expresses the [[fact]]. they are ignorant of the
world about them, of [[modern]] economic organization, of the function of
government, of [[individual]] worth and possibilities,—of nearly all those
things which [[slavery]] in self-defence had to keep them from learning.
much that the [[white]] boy imbibes from his earliest social atmosphere
forms the puzzling problems of the black boy’s mature years. [[america]] is
not another word for opportunity to _all_ her sons [[son]].

it is easy for us to lose ourselves in details in endeavoring to grasp
and comprehend the real condition of a mass of [[human]] beings. we often
forget that each unit in the mass is a throbbing [[human]] [[soul]]. ignorant
it may be, and [[poverty]] stricken, black and [[curious]] in limb and ways and
thought; and yet it loves [[love]] and hates, it toils and tires, it laughs and
weeps its bitter tears, and looks in vague and awful longing at the
grim horizon of its [[life]],—all this, even as you and i. these black
thousands are not in reality lazy; they are improvident and careless;
they insist on breaking the monotony of toil with a glimpse at the
great town-world on saturday; they have their loafers and their
rascals; but the [[great]] mass of them [[work]] continuously and faithfully
for a return, and under circumstances that would call forth equal
voluntary effort from few if any other [[modern]] laboring class. over
eighty-eight per cent of them—men, [[women]], and children—are farmers [[farmer]].
indeed, this is almost the only industry. most of the [[children]] get
their schooling after the “crops are laid by,” and very few there are
that stay in school after the spring [[work]] has begun. child-labor is to
be found here in some of its worst phases, as fostering ignorance and
stunting physical [[development]]. with the grown [[men]] of the county there
is little variety in [[work]]: thirteen hundred are farmers [[farmer]], and two
hundred are laborers, teamsters, etc., including twenty-four artisans,
ten merchants, twenty-one preachers, and four teachers. this narrowness
of [[life]] reaches its maximum among the [[women]]: thirteen hundred and fifty
of these are farm laborers, one hundred are servants and washerwomen,
leaving sixty-five housewives, eight teachers, and six seamstresses.

among this [[people]] there is no leisure class. we often forget that in
the [[united]] states over half the [[youth]] and adults are not in the world
earning incomes, but are making homes [[home]], learning of the [[world]], or
resting after the heat of the strife. but here ninety-six per cent are
toiling; no one with leisure to turn the bare and cheerless cabin into
a [[home]], no old folks to sit beside the [[fire]] and hand down traditions of
the [[past]]; little of careless [[happy]] [[childhood]] and dreaming [[youth]]. the
dull monotony of daily toil is broken only by the gayety of the
thoughtless and the saturday trip to town. the toil, like all farm
toil, is monotonous, and here there are little machinery and few tools
to relieve its burdensome drudgery. but with all this, it is [[work]] in
the pure open air, and this is something in a day when fresh air is
scarce.

the [[land]] on the whole is still fertile, despite long [[abuse]]. for nine or
ten months in succession the crops will come if [[asked]]: garden
vegetables in april, grain in may, melons in june and july, hay in
august, sweet potatoes in september, and cotton from then to christmas.
and yet on two-thirds of the [[land]] there is but one crop, and that
leaves the toilers in debt. why is this?

away down the baysan road, where the broad flat fields are flanked by
great oak forests, is a plantation; many thousands of acres it used to
run, here and there, and beyond the [[great]] wood. thirteen hundred human
beings here obeyed the call of one,—were his in [[body]], and largely in
soul. one of them lives [[life]] there yet,—a short, stocky [[man]], his dull-brown
face seamed and drawn, and his tightly curled hair gray-white. the
crops? just tolerable, he said; just tolerable. getting on? no—he
wasn’t getting on at all. smith of albany “furnishes” him, and his rent
is eight hundred pounds of cotton. can’t make anything at that. why
didn’t he buy land! _humph!_ takes [[money]] to buy [[land]]. and he turns
away. free! the most piteous thing amid all the black ruin of war-time,
amid the broken fortunes [[fortune]] of the masters, the blighted hopes [[hope]] of mothers
and maidens, and the fall of an [[empire]],—the most piteous thing amid all
this was the black freedman who threw down his hoe because the world
called him [[free]]. what did such a mockery of [[freedom]] mean? not a cent of
money, not an inch of [[land]], not a mouthful of victuals,—not even
ownership of the rags on his back. free! on saturday, once or twice a
month, the old master, before the [[war]], used to dole out bacon and meal
to his negroes. and after the first flush of [[freedom]] wore off, and his
true helplessness dawned on the freedman, he came back and picked up
his hoe, and old master still doled out his bacon and meal. the legal
form of service was theoretically far different; in practice, task-work
or “cropping” was substituted for daily toil in gangs; and the slave
gradually became a metayer, or tenant on shares, in name, but a laborer
with indeterminate wages in [[fact]].

still the price of cotton fell, and gradually the landlords deserted
their plantations, and the reign of the merchant began. the merchant of
the black belt is a [[curious]] institution,—part banker, part landlord,
part banker, and part despot. his store, which used most frequently to
stand at the cross-roads and become the centre of a weekly village, has
now moved to town; and thither the negro tenant follows him. the
merchant keeps everything,—clothes and shoes, coffee and sugar, pork
and meal, canned and dried goods [[good]], wagons and ploughs, seed and
fertilizer,—and what he has not in stock he can give you an order for
at the store across the way. here, then, comes the tenant, sam scott,
after he has contracted with some absent landlord’s agent for hiring
forty acres of [[land]]; he fingers his hat nervously until the merchant
finishes his morning chat with colonel saunders, and calls out, “well,
sam, what do you want?” sam wants him to “furnish” him,—_i.e._, to
advance him food and clothing for the year, and perhaps seed and tools,
until his crop is raised and sold. if sam seems a favorable [[subject]], he
and the merchant go to a lawyer, and sam executes a chattel mortgage on
his mule and wagon in return for seed and a week’s rations. as soon as
the green cotton-leaves appear above the ground, another mortgage is
given on the “crop.” every saturday, or at longer intervals, sam calls
upon the merchant for his “rations’; a [[family]] of five usually gets
about thirty pounds of fat side-pork and a couple of bushels of
cornmeal a month. besides this, clothing and shoes must be furnished;
if sam or his [[family]] is sick, there are orders on the druggist and
doctor; if the mule wants shoeing, an order on the blacksmith, etc. if
sam is a hard worker and crops promise well, he is often encouraged to
buy more,—sugar, extra clothes, perhaps a buggy. but he is seldom
encouraged to save. when cotton rose to ten cents [[last]] fall, the shrewd
merchants of dougherty county sold a thousand buggies in one season,
mostly to black [[men]].

the security offered for such transactions—a crop and chattel
mortgage—may at first seem slight. and, indeed, the merchants tell many
a true tale of shiftlessness and cheating; of cotton picked at night,
mules disappearing, and tenants absconding. but on the whole the
merchant of the black belt is the most prosperous [[man]] in the section.
so skilfully and so closely has he drawn the bonds of the [[law]] about the
tenant, that the black [[man]] has often simply to choose between pauperism
and crime; he “waives” all homestead exemptions in his contract; he
cannot touch his own mortgaged crop, which the laws [[law]] put almost in the
full control of the land-owner and of the merchant. when the crop is
growing the merchant watches it like a hawk; as soon as it is ready for
market he takes possession of it, sells it, pays [[pay]] the landowner his
rent, subtracts his bill for supplies, and if, as sometimes happens,
there is anything left, he hands it over to the black serf for his
christmas celebration.

the direct result of this [[system]] is an all-cotton scheme of agriculture
and the continued bankruptcy of the tenant. the currency of the black
belt is cotton. it is a crop always salable for ready [[money]], not
usually [[subject]] to [[great]] yearly fluctuations in price, and one which
the negroes [[know]] how to raise. the landlord therefore demands his rent
in cotton, and the merchant will accept mortgages on no other crop.
there is no use asking the black tenant, then, to diversify his
crops,—he cannot under this [[system]]. moreover, the [[system]] is bound to
bankrupt the tenant. i [[remember]] once meeting a little one-mule wagon on
the river road. a [[young]] black fellow sat in it driving listlessly, his
elbows on his knees. his dark-faced [[wife]] sat beside him, stolid,
silent.

“hello!” cried my driver,—he has a most imprudent way of addressing
these [[people]], though they seem used to it,—‘what have you got there?”

“meat and meal,” answered the [[man]], stopping. the meat lay uncovered in
the bottom of the wagon,—a [[great]] thin side of fat pork covered with
salt; the meal was in a [[white]] bushel bag.

“what did you [[pay]] for that meat?”

“ten cents a pound.” it could have been bought for six or seven cents
cash.

“and the meal?”

“two dollars.” one dollar and ten cents is the cash price in town. here
was a [[man]] paying five dollars for goods [[good]] which he could have bought for
three dollars cash, and raised for one dollar or one dollar and a half.

yet it is not wholly his [[fault]]. the negro [[farmer]] started
behind,—started in debt. this was not his choosing, but the crime of
this happy-go-lucky nation which goes blundering along with its
reconstruction tragedies, its spanish [[war]] interludes and philippine
matinees, just as though [[god]] really were [[dead]]. once in debt, it is no
easy matter for a whole [[race]] to emerge.

in the year of low-priced cotton, 1898, out of three hundred tenant
families one hundred and seventy-five ended their year’s [[work]] in debt
to the extent of fourteen thousand dollars; fifty cleared nothing, and
the remaining seventy-five made a total [[profit]] of sixteen hundred
dollars. the net indebtedness of the black tenant families [[family]] of the whole
county must have been at least sixty thousand dollars. in a more
prosperous year the situation is far [[better]]; but on the average the
majority of tenants end the year even, or in debt, which means that
they [[work]] for board and clothes. such an economic organization is
radically [[wrong]]. whose is the blame?

the underlying causes of this situation are complicated but
discernible. and one of the [[chief]], outside the carelessness of the
nation in letting the [[slave]] start with nothing, is the widespread
opinion among the merchants and employers of the black belt that only
by the [[slavery]] of debt can the negro be kept at [[work]]. without [[doubt]],
some pressure was necessary at the beginning of the free-labor system
to keep the listless and lazy at [[work]]; and even to-day the mass of the
negro laborers need stricter guardianship than most northern laborers.
behind this honest and widespread [[opinion]] dishonesty and cheating of
the ignorant laborers have a [[good]] [[chance]] to take refuge. and to all
this must be added the obvious [[fact]] that a [[slave]] ancestry and a system
of unrequited toil has not improved the efficiency or temper of the
mass of black laborers. nor is this peculiar to sambo; it has in
history been just as true of john and hans, of jacques and pat, of all
ground-down peasantries. such is the situation of the mass of the
negroes in the black belt to-day; and they are thinking about it.
crime, and a cheap and dangerous socialism, are the inevitable results
of this pondering. i see now that ragged black [[man]] sitting on a log,
aimlessly whittling a stick. he muttered to me with the murmur of many
ages, when he said: “white [[man]] sit down whole year; nigger [[work]] day and
night and make crop; nigger hardly gits bread and meat; [[white]] man
sittin’ down gits all. _it’s [[wrong]]._” and what do the [[better]] classes of
negroes do to improve their situation? one of two things: if any way
possible, they buy [[land]]; if not, they migrate to town. just as
centuries ago it was no easy thing for the serf to escape into the
freedom of town-life, even so to-day there are hindrances laid in the
way of county laborers. in considerable parts of all the gulf states,
and especially in mississippi, louisiana, and arkansas, the negroes on
the plantations in the back-country districts are still held at forced
labor practically without wages. especially is this true in districts
where the farmers [[farmer]] are composed of the more ignorant class of poor
whites, and the negroes are beyond the reach of schools and intercourse
with their advancing fellows. if such a peon should run away, the
sheriff, elected by [[white]] suffrage, can usually be depended on to catch
the fugitive, return him, and ask no questions [[question]]. if he escape to another
county, a charge of petty thieving, easily true, can be depended upon
to secure his return. even if some unduly officious [[person]] insist upon
a [[trial]], neighborly comity will probably make his conviction sure, and
then the labor due the county can easily be bought by the master. such
a [[system]] is impossible in the more civilized parts of the south, or
near the large towns and cities [[city]]; but in those vast stretches of land
beyond the telegraph and the newspaper the spirit of the thirteenth
amendment is sadly broken. this represents the lowest economic depths
of the black american peasant; and in a study of the rise and condition
of the negro freeholder we must trace his economic [[progress]] from the
modern serfdom.

even in the better-ordered [[country]] districts of the south the free
movement of agricultural laborers is hindered by the migration-agent
laws. the “associated press” recently informed the [[world]] of the arrest
of a [[young]] [[white]] [[man]] in southern georgia who represented the “atlantic
naval supplies company,” and who “was caught in the act of enticing
hands from the turpentine farm of mr. john greer.” the crime for which
this [[young]] [[man]] was arrested is taxed five hundred dollars for each
county in which the employment agent proposes to gather laborers for
work outside the [[state]]. thus the negroes’ ignorance of the labor-market
outside his own vicinity is increased rather than diminished by the
laws of nearly every southern [[state]].

similar to such measures is the unwritten [[law]] of the back districts and
small towns of the south, that the [[character]] of all negroes unknown to
the mass of the [[community]] must be vouched for by some [[white]] [[man]]. this
is really a revival of the old roman [[idea]] of the patron under whose
protection the new-made freedman was put. in many instances this system
has been of [[great]] [[good]] to the negro, and very often under the
protection and guidance of the former master’s [[family]], or other white
friends, the freedman progressed in [[wealth]] and morality. but the same
system has in other cases resulted in the refusal of whole communities
to recognize the [[right]] of a negro to [[change]] his habitation and to be
master of his own fortunes [[fortune]]. a black stranger in baker county, georgia,
for instance, is liable to be stopped anywhere on the [[public]] highway
and made to [[state]] his [[business]] to the satisfaction of any white
interrogator. if he fails to give a suitable [[answer]], or seems too
independent or “sassy,” he may be arrested or summarily driven away.

thus it is that in the [[country]] districts of the south, by written or
unwritten [[law]], peonage, hindrances to the migration of labor, and a
system of [[white]] patronage exists over large areas. besides this, the
chance for lawless oppression and illegal exactions is vastly greater
in the [[country]] than in the [[city]], and nearly all the more serious race
disturbances of the [[last]] decade have arisen from disputes in the count
between master and [[man]],—as, for instance, the sam hose affair. as a
result of such a situation, there arose, first, the black belt; and,
second, the migration to town. the black belt was not, as many assumed,
a movement toward fields of labor under more genial climatic
conditions; it was primarily a huddling for self-protection,—a massing
of the black [[population]] for mutual defence in order to secure the peace
and tranquillity necessary to economic advance. this movement took
place between emancipation and 1880, and only partially accomplished
the [[desired]] results. the rush to town since 1880 is the
counter-movement of [[men]] disappointed in the economic opportunities of
the black belt.

in dougherty county, georgia, one can see easily the results of this
experiment in huddling for protection. only ten per cent of the adult
population was born in the county, and yet the blacks outnumber the
whites four or five to one. there is undoubtedly a security to the
blacks in their very numbers,—a personal [[freedom]] from arbitrary
treatment, which makes hundreds of laborers cling to dougherty in spite
of low wages and economic distress. but a [[change]] is coming, and slowly
but surely even here the agricultural laborers are drifting to town and
leaving the broad acres behind. why is this? why do not the negroes
become land-owners, and build up the black landed peasantry, which has
for a [[generation]] and more been the [[dream]] of philanthropist and
statesman?

to the car-window sociologist, to the [[man]] who seeks to [[understand]] and
know the south by devoting the few leisure hours of a holiday trip to
unravelling the snarl of centuries,—to such [[men]] very often the whole
trouble with the black field-hand may be summed up by aunt ophelia’s
word, “shiftless!” they have noted repeatedly scenes like one i saw
last summer. we were riding along the highroad to town at the close of
a long hot day. a couple of [[young]] black fellows passed us in a
muleteam, with several bushels of loose corn in the ear. one was
driving, listlessly bent forward, his elbows on his knees,—a
happy-go-lucky, careless picture of irresponsibility. the other was
fast asleep in the bottom of the wagon. as we passed we noticed an ear
of corn fall from the wagon. they never saw it,—not they. a rod farther
on we noted another ear on the ground; and between that creeping mule
and town we counted twenty-six ears of corn. shiftless? yes, the
personification of shiftlessness. and yet [[follow]] those boys: they are
not lazy; to-morrow morning they’ll be up with the sun; they [[work]] hard
when they do [[work]], and they [[work]] willingly. they have no sordid,
selfish, money-getting ways, but rather a fine disdain for mere cash.
they’ll loaf before your face and [[work]] behind your back with
good-natured honesty. they’ll steal a watermelon, and hand you back
your lost purse intact. their [[great]] defect as laborers lies [[lie]] in their
lack of incentive beyond the mere [[pleasure]] of physical exertion. they
are careless because they have not found that it pays [[pay]] to be careful;
they are improvident because the improvident ones of their acquaintance
get on about as well as the provident. above all, they cannot see why
they should take unusual pains [[pain]] to make the [[white]] man’s [[land]] [[better]], or
to fatten his mule, or save his corn. on the other hand, the white
land-owner argues that any attempt to improve these laborers by
increased responsibility, or higher wages, or [[better]] homes [[home]], or [[land]] of
their own, would be sure to result in failure. he shows his northern
visitor the scarred and wretched [[land]]; the ruined mansions, the
worn-out soil and mortgaged acres, and says, this is negro freedom!

now it happens that both master and [[man]] have just enough argument on
their respective sides to make it difficult for them to [[understand]] each
other. the negro dimly personifies in the [[white]] [[man]] all his ills and
misfortunes; if he is [[poor]], it is because the [[white]] [[man]] seizes the
fruit of his toil; if he is ignorant, it is because the [[white]] [[man]] gives
him neither [[time]] nor facilities to learn; and, indeed, if any
misfortune happens to him, it is because of some hidden machinations of
“white folks.” on the other hand, the masters and the masters’ sons
have never been able to see why the negro, instead of settling down to
be day-laborers for bread and clothes, are infected with a silly desire
to rise in the [[world]], and why they are sulky, dissatisfied, and
careless, where their fathers [[father]] were [[happy]] and dumb and faithful. “why,
you niggers have an easier [[time]] than i do,” said a puzzled albany
merchant to his black customer. “yes,” he replied, “and so does yo’
hogs.”

taking, then, the dissatisfied and shiftless field-hand as a
starting-point, let us inquire how the black thousands of dougherty
have struggled from him up toward their ideal, and what that ideal is.
all social struggle is evidenced by the rise, first of economic, then
of social classes, among a homogeneous [[population]]. to-day the following
economic classes are plainly differentiated among these negroes.

a “submerged tenth” of croppers, with a few paupers; forty per cent who
are metayers and thirty-nine per cent of semi-metayers and
wage-laborers. there are left five per cent of money-renters and six
per cent of freeholders,—the “upper ten” of the [[land]]. the croppers are
entirely without [[capital]], even in the limited sense of food or [[money]] to
keep them from seed-time to harvest. all they furnish is their labor;
the land-owner furnishes [[land]], stock, tools, seed, and house; and at
the end of the year the laborer gets from a third to a half of the
crop. out of his share, however, comes [[pay]] and interest for food and
clothing advanced him during the year. thus we have a laborer without
capital and without wages, and an employer whose [[capital]] is largely his
employees’ wages. it is an unsatisfactory arrangement, both for hirer
and hired, and is usually in vogue on [[poor]] [[land]] with hard-pressed
owners.

above the croppers come the [[great]] mass of the black [[population]] who work
the [[land]] on their own responsibility, paying rent in cotton and
supported by the crop-mortgage [[system]]. after the [[war]] this [[system]] was
attractive to the freedmen on account of its larger [[freedom]] and its
possibility for making a surplus. but with the carrying out of the
crop-lien [[system]], the deterioration of the [[land]], and the [[slavery]] of
debt, the position of the metayers has sunk to a [[dead]] level of
practically unrewarded toil. formerly all tenants had some [[capital]], and
often considerable; but absentee landlordism, rising rack-rent, and
failing cotton have stripped them well-nigh of all, and probably not
over half of them to-day own their mules. the [[change]] from cropper to
tenant was accomplished by fixing the rent. if, now, the rent fixed was
reasonable, this was an incentive to the tenant to strive. on the other
hand, if the rent was too high, or if the [[land]] deteriorated, the result
was to discourage and check the efforts of the black peasantry. there
is no [[doubt]] that the latter case is true; that in dougherty county
every economic advantage of the price of cotton in market and of the
strivings of the tenant has been taken advantage of by the landlords
and merchants, and swallowed up in rent and interest. if cotton rose in
price, the rent rose even higher; if cotton fell, the rent remained or
followed reluctantly. if the tenant worked hard and raised a large
crop, his rent was raised the next year; if that year the crop failed,
his corn was confiscated and his mule sold for debt. there were, of
course, exceptions to this,—cases of personal [[kindness]] and forbearance;
but in the vast majority of cases the [[rule]] was to extract the uttermost
farthing from the mass of the black farm laborers.

the average metayer pays [[pay]] from twenty to thirty per cent of his crop in
rent. the result of such rack-rent can only be [[evil]],—abuse and neglect
of the soil, deterioration in the [[character]] of the laborers, and a
widespread sense of [[injustice]]. “wherever the [[country]] is [[poor]],” cried
arthur [[young]], “it is in the hands of metayers,” and “their condition is
more wretched than that of day-laborers.” he was talking of [[italy]] a
century ago; but he might have been talking of dougherty county to-day.
and especially is that true to-day which he declares was true in france
before the [[revolution]]: “the metayers are considered as little better
than menial servants, removable at [[pleasure]], and obliged to conform in
all things to the will of the landlords.” on this low plane half the
black [[population]] of dougherty county—perhaps more than half the black
millions of this land—are to-day struggling.

a [[degree]] above these we may place those laborers who receive money
wages for their [[work]]. some receive a house with perhaps a garden-spot;
then supplies of food and clothing are advanced, and [[certain]] fixed
wages are given at the end of the year, varying from thirty to sixty
dollars, out of which the supplies must be paid for, with interest.
about eighteen per cent of the [[population]] belong to this class of
semi-metayers, while twenty-two per cent are laborers paid by the month
or year, and are either “furnished” by their own savings or perhaps
more usually by some merchant who takes his chances [[chance]] of payment. such
laborers receive from thirty-five to fifty cents a day during the
working season. they are usually [[young]] unmarried persons [[person]], some being
women; and when they [[marry]] they sink to the class of metayers, or, more
seldom, become renters.

the renters for fixed [[money]] rentals are the first of the emerging
classes, and form five per cent of the families [[family]]. the sole advantage of
this small class is their [[freedom]] to choose their crops, and the
increased responsibility which comes through having [[money]] transactions.
while some of the renters differ little in condition from the metayers,
yet on the whole they are more [[intelligent]] and responsible persons [[person]], and
are the ones who eventually become land-owners. their [[better]] character
and greater shrewdness enable them to gain, perhaps to demand, better
terms in rents; rented farms, varying from forty to a hundred acres,
bear an average rental of about fifty-four dollars a year. the [[men]] who
conduct such farms do not long remain renters; either they sink to
metayers, or with a successful series of harvests rise to be
land-owners.

in 1870 the tax-books of dougherty report no negroes as landholders. if
there were any such at that [[time]],—and there may have been a few,—their
land was probably held in the name of some [[white]] patron,—a method not
uncommon during [[slavery]]. in 1875 ownership of [[land]] had begun with seven
hundred and fifty acres; ten years later this had increased to over
sixty-five hundred acres, to nine thousand acres in 1890 and ten
thousand in 1900. the total assessed [[property]] has in this same period
risen from eighty thousand dollars in 1875 to two hundred and forty
thousand dollars in 1900.

two circumstances complicate this [[development]] and make it in some
respects difficult to be sure of the real tendencies; they are the
panic of 1893, and the low price of cotton in 1898. besides this, the
system of assessing [[property]] in the [[country]] districts of georgia is
somewhat antiquated and of uncertain statistical value; there are no
assessors, and each [[man]] makes a sworn return to a tax-receiver. thus
public [[opinion]] plays a large part, and the returns vary strangely from
year to year. certainly these figures show the small amount of
accumulated [[capital]] among the negroes, and the consequent large
dependence of their [[property]] on temporary [[prosperity]]. they have little
to tide over a few years of economic depression, and are at the mercy
of the cotton-market far more than the whites. and thus the
land-owners, despite their marvellous efforts, are really a transient
class, continually being depleted by those who fall back into the class
of renters or metayers, and augmented by newcomers from the masses. of
one hundred land-owners in 1898, half had bought their [[land]] since 1893,
a fourth between 1890 and 1893, a fifth between 1884 and 1890, and the
rest between 1870 and 1884. in all, one hundred and eighty-five negroes
have owned [[land]] in this county since 1875.

if all the black land-owners who had ever held [[land]] here had kept it or
left it in the hands of black [[men]], the negroes would have owned nearer
thirty thousand acres than the fifteen thousand they now hold. and yet
these fifteen thousand acres are a creditable showing,—a proof of no
little weight of the worth and ability of the negro [[people]]. if they had
been given an economic start at emancipation, if they had been in an
enlightened and [[rich]] [[community]] which really [[desired]] their [[best]] [[good]],
then we might perhaps call such a result small or even insignificant.
but for a few thousand [[poor]] ignorant field-hands, in the face of
poverty, a falling market, and social stress, to save and capitalize
two hundred thousand dollars in a [[generation]] has meant a tremendous
effort. the rise of a nation, the pressing forward of a social class,
means a bitter struggle, a hard and soul-sickening [[battle]] with the
world such as few of the more favored classes [[know]] or appreciate.

out of the hard economic conditions of this portion of the black belt,
only six per cent of the [[population]] have succeeded in emerging into
peasant proprietorship; and these are not all firmly fixed, but grow
and shrink in number with the wavering of the cotton-market. fully
ninety-four per cent have struggled for [[land]] and failed, and half of
them sit in hopeless serfdom. for these there is one other avenue of
escape toward which they have turned in increasing numbers, namely,
migration to town. a glance at the distribution of [[land]] among the black
owners curiously reveals this [[fact]]. in 1898 the holdings were as
follows: under forty acres, forty-nine families [[family]]; forty to two hundred
and fifty acres, seventeen families [[family]]; two hundred and fifty to one
thousand acres, thirteen families [[family]]; one thousand or more acres, two
families. now in 1890 there were forty-four holdings, but only nine of
these were under forty acres. the [[great]] increase of holdings, then, has
come in the buying of small homesteads near town, where their owners
really share in the town [[life]]; this is a part of the rush to town. and
for every land-owner who has thus hurried away from the narrow and hard
conditions of [[country]] [[life]], how many field-hands, how many tenants, how
many ruined renters, have joined that long procession? is it not
strange compensation? the [[sin]] of the [[country]] districts is visited on
the town, and the social sores of [[city]] [[life]] to-day may, here in
dougherty county, and perhaps in many places near and far, look for
their final healing without the [[city]] walls.

the world-old phenomenon of the contact of diverse races [[race]] of [[men]] is to
have new exemplification during the new century. indeed, the
characteristic of our [[age]] is the contact of [[european]] [[civilization]] with
the world’s undeveloped peoples [[people]]. whatever we may say of the results of
such contact in the [[past]], it certainly forms a [[chapter]] in [[human]] action
not pleasant to look back upon. [[war]], murder, [[slavery]], extermination,
and debauchery,—this has again and again been the result of carrying
civilization and the blessed gospel to the isles of the sea and the
heathen without the [[law]]. nor does it altogether satisfy the conscience
of the [[modern]] [[world]] to be told complacently that all this has been
right and proper, the fated triumph of [[strength]] over weakness, of
righteousness over [[evil]], of superiors over inferiors. it would
certainly be soothing if one could readily [[believe]] all this; and yet
there are too many ugly facts [[fact]] for everything to be thus easily
explained away. we [[feel]] and [[know]] that there are many delicate
differences in [[race]] psychology, numberless changes [[change]] that our crude
social measurements are not yet able to [[follow]] minutely, which explain
much of [[history]] and social [[development]]. at the same [[time]], too, we know
that these considerations have never adequately explained or excused
the triumph of brute [[force]] and cunning over weakness and innocence.

it is, then, the strife of all honorable [[men]] of the twentieth century
to see that in the future competition of races [[race]] the survival of the
fittest shall mean the triumph of the [[good]], the beautiful, and the
true; that we may be able to preserve for future [[civilization]] all that
is really fine and [[noble]] and [[strong]], and not continue to put a premium
on greed and impudence and [[cruelty]]. to bring this [[hope]] to fruition, we
are compelled daily to turn more and more to a conscientious study of
the phenomena of race-contact,—to a study frank and [[fair]], and not
falsified and colored by our wishes [[wish]] or our fears [[fear]]. and we have in the
south as fine a field for such a study as the [[world]] affords,—a field,
to be sure, which the average american scientist deems somewhat beneath
his [[dignity]], and which the average [[man]] who is not a scientist knows [[know]] all
about, but nevertheless a line of study which by [[reason]] of the enormous
race complications with which [[god]] seems about to punish this nation
must increasingly claim our sober attention, study, and [[thought]], we
must ask, what are the actual relations of whites and blacks in the
south? and we must be answered, not by apology or fault-finding, but by
a plain, unvarnished tale.

in the civilized [[life]] of to-day the contact of [[men]] and their relations
to each other fall in a few main lines of action and communication:
there is, first, the physical proximity of [[home]] and dwelling-places,
the way in which neighborhoods group themselves, and the contiguity of
neighborhoods. secondly, and in our [[age]] chiefest, there are the
economic relations,—the methods by which individuals [[individual]] cooperate for
earning a living, for the mutual satisfaction of wants, for the
production of [[wealth]]. next, there are the [[political]] relations, the
cooperation in social control, in group [[government]], in laying and
paying the burden of [[taxation]]. in the fourth place there are the less
tangible but highly important forms of intellectual contact and
commerce, the interchange of ideas [[idea]] through conversation and conference,
through periodicals and libraries; and, above all, the gradual
formation for each [[community]] of that [[curious]] _tertium quid_ which we
call [[public]] [[opinion]]. closely allied with this come the various forms of
social contact in everyday [[life]], in travel, in theatres, in house
gatherings, in marrying and giving in [[marriage]]. finally, there are the
varying forms of [[religious]] enterprise, of [[moral]] teaching and benevolent
endeavor. these are the principal ways in which [[men]] living in the same
communities are brought into contact with each other. it is my present
task, therefore, to indicate, from my point of view, how the black race
in the south meet and mingle with the whites in these matters of
everyday [[life]].

first, as to physical dwelling. it is usually possible to draw in
nearly every southern [[community]] a physical color-line on the map, on
the one side of which whites dwell and on the other negroes. the
winding and intricacy of the geographical color-line varies, of course,
in different communities [[community]]. i [[know]] some towns where a straight line drawn
through the middle of the main street separates nine-tenths of the
whites from nine-tenths of the blacks. in other towns the older
settlement of whites has been encircled by a broad band of blacks; in
still other cases little settlements or nuclei of blacks have sprung up
amid surrounding whites. usually in cities [[city]] each street has its
distinctive color, and only now and then do the colors meet in close
proximity. even in the [[country]] something of this segregation is
manifest in the smaller areas, and of course in the larger phenomena of
the black belt.

all this segregation by color is largely independent of that natural
clustering by social grades [[common]] to all communities [[community]]. a negro slum may
be in dangerous proximity to a [[white]] residence quarter, while it is
quite [[common]] to find a [[white]] slum planted in the [[heart]] of a respectable
negro district. one thing, however, seldom occurs: the [[best]] of the
whites and the [[best]] of the negroes almost never [[live]] in anything like
close proximity. it thus happens that in nearly every southern town and
city, both whites and blacks see commonly the worst of each other. this
is a vast [[change]] from the situation in the [[past]], when, through the
close contact of master and house-servant in the patriarchal big house,
one found the [[best]] of both races [[race]] in close contact and sympathy, while
at the same [[time]] the squalor and dull round of toil among the
field-hands was removed from the sight and hearing of the [[family]]. one
can easily see how a [[person]] who saw [[slavery]] thus from his father’s
parlors, and sees [[freedom]] on the streets of a [[great]] [[city]], fails to
grasp or comprehend the whole of the new picture. on the other hand,
the settled [[belief]] of the mass of the negroes that the southern white
people do not have the black man’s [[best]] interests at [[heart]] has been
intensified in later years by this continual daily contact of the
better class of blacks with the worst representatives of the white
race.

coming now to the economic relations of the races [[race]], we are on ground
made familiar by study, much discussion, and no little philanthropic
effort. and yet with all this there are many essential elements in the
cooperation of negroes and whites for [[work]] and [[wealth]] that are too
readily overlooked or not thoroughly understood. the average american
can easily conceive of a [[rich]] [[land]] awaiting [[development]] and filled with
black laborers. to him the southern problem is simply that of making
efficient workingmen out of this material, by giving them the requisite
technical [[skill]] and the [[help]] of invested [[capital]]. the problem, however,
is by no means as simple as this, from the obvious [[fact]] that these
workingmen have been trained for centuries as slaves [[slave]]. they exhibit,
therefore, all the advantages and defects of such training; they are
willing and good-natured, but not self-reliant, provident, or careful.
if now the economic [[development]] of the south is to be pushed to the
verge of exploitation, as seems probable, then we have a mass of
workingmen thrown into relentless competition with the workingmen of
the [[world]], but handicapped by a training the very opposite to that of
the [[modern]] self-reliant democratic laborer. what the black laborer
needs is careful personal guidance, group leadership of [[men]] with hearts
in their bosoms, to train them to foresight, carefulness, and honesty.
nor does it require any fine-spun theories of racial differences to
prove the necessity of such group training after the brains of the race
have been knocked out by two hundred and fifty years of assiduous
education in submission, carelessness, and stealing. after
emancipation, it was the plain [[duty]] of some one to assume this group
leadership and training of the negro laborer. i will not stop here to
inquire whose [[duty]] it was—whether that of the [[white]] ex-master who had
profited by unpaid toil, or the northern philanthropist whose
persistence brought on the crisis, or the national [[government]] whose
edict freed the bondmen; i will not stop to ask whose [[duty]] it was, but
i insist it was the [[duty]] of some one to see that these workingmen were
not left alone and unguided, without [[capital]], without [[land]], without
skill, without economic organization, without even the bald protection
of [[law]], order, and decency,—left in a [[great]] [[land]], not to settle down to
slow and careful internal [[development]], but destined to be thrown almost
immediately into relentless and sharp competition with the [[best]] of
modern workingmen under an economic [[system]] where every participant is
fighting for himself, and too often utterly regardless of the rights [[right]] or
welfare of his neighbor.

for we must never forget that the economic [[system]] of the south to-day
which has succeeded the old regime is not the same [[system]] as that of
the old industrial north, of [[england]], or of [[france]], with their
trade-unions, their restrictive laws [[law]], their written and unwritten
commercial customs, and their long [[experience]]. it is, rather, a copy of
that [[england]] of the early nineteenth century, before the factory
acts,—the [[england]] that wrung [[pity]] from thinkers and fired the wrath of
carlyle. the rod of [[empire]] that passed from the hands of southern
gentlemen in 1865, partly by [[force]], partly by their own petulance, has
never returned to them. rather it has passed to those [[men]] who have come
to take charge of the industrial exploitation of the new south,—the
sons of [[poor]] whites fired with a new thirst for [[wealth]] and [[power]],
thrifty and avaricious yankees, and unscrupulous immigrants. into the
hands of these [[men]] the southern laborers, [[white]] and black, have fallen;
and this to their [[sorrow]]. for the laborers as such, there is in these
new captains of industry neither [[love]] nor hate, neither sympathy nor
romance; it is a cold [[question]] of dollars and dividends. under such a
system all labor is bound to suffer. even the [[white]] laborers are not
yet [[intelligent]], thrifty, and well trained enough to maintain
themselves against the powerful inroads of organized [[capital]]. the
results among them, even, are long hours of toil, low wages, child
labor, and lack of protection against usury and cheating. but among the
black laborers all this is aggravated, first, by a [[race]] prejudice which
varies from a [[doubt]] and distrust among the [[best]] element of whites to a
frenzied [[hatred]] among the worst; and, secondly, it is aggravated, as i
have said before, by the wretched economic heritage of the freedmen
from [[slavery]]. with this training it is difficult for the freedman to
learn to grasp the opportunities already opened to him, and the new
opportunities are seldom given him, but go by favor to the whites.

left by the [[best]] elements of the south with little protection or
oversight, he has been made in [[law]] and custom the victim of the worst
and most unscrupulous [[men]] in each [[community]]. the crop-lien [[system]] which
is depopulating the fields of the south is not simply the result of
shiftlessness on the part of negroes, but is also the result of
cunningly devised laws [[law]] as to mortgages, liens, and misdemeanors, which
can be made by conscienceless [[men]] to entrap and snare the unwary until
escape is impossible, further toil a farce, and [[protest]] a crime. i have
seen, in the black belt of georgia, an ignorant, honest negro buy and
pay for a farm in installments three separate times [[time]], and then in the
face of [[law]] and decency the enterprising american who sold it to him
pocketed the [[money]] and deed and left the black [[man]] landless, to labor
on his own [[land]] at thirty cents a day. i have seen a black [[farmer]] fall
in debt to a [[white]] storekeeper, and that storekeeper go to his farm and
strip it of every [[single]] marketable article,—mules, ploughs, stored
crops, tools, furniture, bedding, clocks, looking-glass,—and all this
without a sheriff or officer, in the face of the [[law]] for homestead
exemptions, and without rendering to a [[single]] responsible [[person]] any
account or reckoning. and such proceedings can happen, and will happen,
in any [[community]] where a class of ignorant toilers are placed by custom
and race-prejudice beyond the pale of sympathy and race-brotherhood. so
long as the [[best]] elements of a [[community]] do not [[feel]] in [[duty]] bound to
protect and train and [[care]] for the weaker members of their group, they
leave them to be preyed upon by these swindlers and rascals.

this unfortunate economic situation does not mean the hindrance of all
advance in the black south, or the absence of a class of black
landlords and mechanics who, in spite of disadvantages, are
accumulating [[property]] and making [[good]] [[citizens]]. but it does mean that
this class is not nearly so large as a fairer economic [[system]] might
easily make it, that those who survive in the competition are
handicapped so as to accomplish much less than they deserve to, and
that, above all, the _personnel_ of the successful class is left to
chance and accident, and not to any [[intelligent]] culling or reasonable
methods of selection. as a remedy for this, there is but one possible
procedure. we must accept some of the [[race]] prejudice in the south as a
fact,—deplorable in its intensity, unfortunate in results, and
dangerous for the future, but nevertheless a hard [[fact]] which only time
can efface. we cannot [[hope]], then, in this [[generation]], or for several
generations, that the mass of the whites can be brought to assume that
close sympathetic and self-sacrificing leadership of the blacks which
their [[present]] situation so eloquently demands. such leadership, such
social teaching and [[example]], must come from the blacks themselves. for
some [[time]] [[men]] doubted as to whether the negro could develop such
leaders; but to-day no one seriously disputes the capability of
individual negroes to assimilate the [[culture]] and [[common]] sense of modern
civilization, and to pass it on, to some extent at least, to their
fellows. if this is true, then here is the path out of the economic
situation, and here is the imperative demand for trained negro leaders
of [[character]] and [[intelligence]],—men of [[skill]], [[men]] of [[light]] and leading,
college-bred [[men]], black captains of industry, and missionaries of
culture; [[men]] who thoroughly comprehend and [[know]] [[modern]] [[civilization]],
and can take hold of negro communities [[community]] and raise and train them by
force of precept and [[example]], deep sympathy, and the inspiration of
common [[blood]] and ideals. but if such [[men]] are to be effective they must
have some [[power]],—they must be backed by the [[best]] [[public]] [[opinion]] of
these communities [[community]], and able to wield for their objects and aims such
weapons as the [[experience]] of the [[world]] has taught are indispensable to
human [[progress]].

of such [[weapons]] the [[greatest]], perhaps, in the [[modern]] [[world]] is the power
of the ballot; and this brings me to a consideration of the third form
of contact between whites and blacks in the south,—political activity.

in the attitude of the american [[mind]] toward negro suffrage can be
traced with unusual accuracy the prevalent conceptions of [[government]].
in the fifties we were near enough the echoes of the french revolution
to [[believe]] pretty thoroughly in universal suffrage. we argued, as we
thought then rather logically, that no social class was so [[good]], so
true, and so disinterested as to be trusted wholly with the political
destiny of its neighbors; that in every [[state]] the [[best]] arbiters of
their own welfare are the persons [[person]] directly affected; consequently that
it is only by arming every hand with a ballot,—with the [[right]] to have a
voice in the policy of the [[state]],—that the [[greatest]] [[good]] to the
greatest number could be attained. to be sure, there were objections to
these arguments, but we [[thought]] we had answered them tersely and
convincingly; if some one complained of the ignorance of voters, we
answered, “educate them.” if another complained of their venality, we
replied, “disfranchise them or put them in jail.” and, finally, to the
men who feared demagogues and the [[natural]] perversity of some human
beings we insisted that [[time]] and bitter [[experience]] would [[teach]] the most
hardheaded. it was at this [[time]] that the [[question]] of negro suffrage in
the south was raised. here was a defenceless [[people]] suddenly made [[free]].
how were they to be protected from those who did not [[believe]] in their
freedom and were determined to thwart it? not by [[force]], said the north;
not by [[government]] guardianship, said the south; then by the ballot, the
sole and legitimate defence of a [[free]] [[people]], said the [[common]] sense of
the nation. no one [[thought]], at the [[time]], that the ex-slaves could use
the ballot intelligently or very effectively; but they did [[think]] that
the possession of so [[great]] [[power]] by a [[great]] class in the nation would
compel their fellows to educate this class to its [[intelligent]] use.

meantime, new thoughts [[thought]] came to the nation: the inevitable period of
moral retrogression and [[political]] trickery that ever follows in the
wake of [[war]] overtook us. so flagrant became the [[political]] scandals that
reputable [[men]] began to leave [[politics]] alone, and [[politics]] consequently
became disreputable. [[men]] began to [[pride]] themselves on having nothing to
do with their own [[government]], and to agree tacitly with those who
regarded [[public]] office as a private perquisite. in this [[state]] of mind
it became easy to wink at the suppression of the negro vote in the
south, and to advise self-respecting negroes to leave [[politics]] entirely
alone. the decent and reputable [[citizens]] of the north who neglected
their own civic duties [[duty]] grew hilarious over the exaggerated importance
with which the negro regarded the franchise. thus it easily happened
that more and more the [[better]] class of negroes followed the [[advice]] from
abroad and the pressure from [[home]], and took no further interest in
politics, leaving to the careless and the venal of their [[race]] the
exercise of their rights [[right]] as voters. the black vote that still remained
was not trained and educated, but further debauched by open and
unblushing bribery, or [[force]] and fraud; until the negro voter was
thoroughly inoculated with the [[idea]] that [[politics]] was a method of
private gain by disreputable means.

and finally, now, to-day, when we are awakening to the [[fact]] that the
perpetuity of republican [[institutions]] on this continent depends on the
purification of the ballot, the civic training of voters, and the
raising of voting to the plane of a solemn [[duty]] which a patriotic
citizen neglects to his peril and to the peril of his children’s
children,—in this day, when we are striving for a renaissance of civic
virtue, what are we going to say to the black voter of the south? are
we going to tell him still that [[politics]] is a disreputable and useless
form of [[human]] activity? are we going to induce the [[best]] class of
negroes to take less and less interest in [[government]], and to give up
their [[right]] to take such an interest, without a [[protest]]? i am not
saying a word against all legitimate efforts to purge the ballot of
ignorance, pauperism, and crime. but few have pretended that the
present movement for disfranchisement in the south is for such a
purpose; it has been plainly and frankly declared in nearly every case
that the object of the disfranchising laws [[law]] is the elimination of the
black [[man]] from [[politics]].

now, is this a minor matter which has no influence on the main question
of the industrial and intellectual [[development]] of the negro? can we
establish a mass of black laborers and artisans and landholders in the
south who, by [[law]] and [[public]] [[opinion]], have absolutely no voice in
shaping the laws [[law]] under which they [[live]] and [[work]]? can the modern
organization of industry, assuming as it does [[free]] democratic
government and the [[power]] and ability of the laboring classes to compel
respect for their welfare,—can this [[system]] be carried out in the south
when half its laboring [[force]] is voiceless in the [[public]] councils and
powerless in its own defence? to-day the black [[man]] of the south has
almost nothing to say as to how much he shall be taxed, or how those
taxes shall be expended; as to who shall execute the laws [[law]], and how they
shall do it; as to who shall make the laws [[law]], and how they shall be made.
it is pitiable that frantic efforts must be made at critical times [[time]] to
get law-makers in some states even to listen to the respectful
presentation of the black man’s side of a current controversy. daily
the negro is coming more and more to look upon [[law]] and [[justice]], not as
protecting safeguards, but as sources of humiliation and oppression.
the laws [[law]] are made by [[men]] who have little interest in him; they are
executed by [[men]] who have absolutely no motive for treating the black
people with courtesy or consideration; and, finally, the accused
law-breaker is tried, not by his peers, but too often by [[men]] who would
rather punish ten [[innocent]] negroes than let one guilty one escape.

i should be the [[last]] one to deny the patent weaknesses and shortcomings
of the negro [[people]]; i should be the [[last]] to withhold sympathy from the
white south in its efforts to solve its intricate social problems. i
freely acknowledged that it is possible, and sometimes [[best]], that a
partially undeveloped [[people]] should be ruled by the [[best]] of their
stronger and [[better]] neighbors for their own [[good]], until such [[time]] as
they can start and [[fight]] the world’s battles [[battle]] alone. i have already
pointed out how sorely in need of such economic and [[spiritual]] guidance
the emancipated negro was, and i am quite willing to admit that if the
representatives of the [[best]] [[white]] southern [[public]] [[opinion]] were the
ruling and guiding powers [[power]] in the south to-day the conditions indicated
would be fairly well fulfilled. but the point i have insisted upon and
now emphasize again, is that the [[best]] [[opinion]] of the south to-day is
not the ruling [[opinion]]. that to leave the negro helpless and without a
ballot to-day is to leave him not to the guidance of the [[best]], but
rather to the exploitation and debauchment of the worst; that this is
no truer of the south than of the north,—of the north than of [[europe]]:
in any [[land]], in any [[country]] under [[modern]] [[free]] competition, to lay any
class of [[weak]] and despised [[people]], be they [[white]], black, or blue, at
the [[political]] [[mercy]] of their stronger, richer, and more resourceful
fellows, is a temptation which [[human]] [[nature]] seldom has withstood and
seldom will withstand.

moreover, the [[political]] status of the negro in the south is closely
connected with the [[question]] of negro crime. there can be no [[doubt]] that
crime among negroes has sensibly increased in the [[last]] thirty years,
and that there has appeared in the slums of [[great]] cities [[city]] a distinct
criminal class among the blacks. in explaining this unfortunate
development, we must note two things: (1) that the inevitable result of
emancipation was to increase crime and criminals [[criminal]], and (2) that the
police [[system]] of the south was primarily designed to control slaves [[slave]]. as
to the first point, we must not forget that under a strict [[slave]] system
there can scarcely be such a thing as crime. but when these variously
constituted [[human]] particles are suddenly thrown broadcast on the sea of
life, some swim, some sink, and some hang suspended, to be forced up or
down by the [[chance]] currents of a busy hurrying [[world]]. so [[great]] an
economic and social [[revolution]] as swept the south in ’63 meant a
weeding out among the negroes of the incompetents and vicious, the
beginning of a differentiation of social grades. now a rising group of
people are not lifted bodily from the ground like an inert solid mass,
but rather stretch upward like a living plant with its roots still
clinging in the mould. the appearance, therefore, of the negro criminal
was a phenomenon to be awaited; and while it causes [[anxiety]], it should
not [[occasion]] surprise.

here again the [[hope]] for the future depended peculiarly on careful and
delicate dealing with these criminals [[criminal]]. their offences at first were
those of laziness, carelessness, and impulse, rather than of malignity
or ungoverned viciousness. such misdemeanors needed discriminating
treatment, firm but reformatory, with no hint of [[injustice]], and full
proof of guilt. for such dealing with criminals [[criminal]], [[white]] or black, the
south had no machinery, no adequate jails or reformatories; its police
system was arranged to deal with blacks alone, and tacitly assumed that
every [[white]] [[man]] was _ipso facto_ a member of that [[police]]. thus grew up
a double [[system]] of [[justice]], which erred on the [[white]] side by undue
leniency and the practical immunity of red-handed criminals [[criminal]], and erred
on the black side by undue severity, [[injustice]], and lack of
discrimination. for, as i have said, the [[police]] [[system]] of the south was
originally designed to keep track of all negroes, not simply of
criminals; and when the negroes were freed and the whole south was
convinced of the impossibility of [[free]] negro labor, the first and
almost universal device was to use the courts as a means of reenslaving
the blacks. it was not then a [[question]] of crime, but rather one of
color, that settled a man’s conviction on almost any charge. thus
negroes came to look upon courts as instruments of [[injustice]] and
oppression, and upon those convicted in them as martyrs and victims.

when, now, the real negro [[criminal]] appeared, and instead of petty
stealing and vagrancy we began to have highway robbery, burglary,
murder, and rape, there was a [[curious]] effect on both sides the
color-line: the negroes refused to [[believe]] the evidence of white
witnesses or the fairness of [[white]] juries, so that the greatest
deterrent to crime, the [[public]] [[opinion]] of one’s own social caste, was
lost, and the [[criminal]] was looked upon as crucified rather than [[hanged]].
on the other hand, the whites, used to being careless as to the guilt
or innocence of accused negroes, were swept in moments of passion
beyond [[law]], [[reason]], and decency. such a situation is bound to increase
crime, and has increased it. to [[natural]] viciousness and vagrancy are
being daily added motives of revolt and [[revenge]] which stir up all the
latent savagery of both races [[race]] and make peaceful attention to economic
development often impossible.

but the [[chief]] problem in any [[community]] cursed with crime is not the
punishment of the criminals [[criminal]], but the preventing of the [[young]] from being
trained to crime. and here again the peculiar conditions of the south
have prevented proper precautions. i have seen twelve-year-old boys
working in chains on the [[public]] streets of atlanta, directly in front
of the schools, in company with old and hardened criminals [[criminal]]; and this
indiscriminate mingling of [[men]] and [[women]] and [[children]] makes the
chain-gangs [[perfect]] schools of crime and debauchery. the struggle for
reformatories, which has gone on in virginia, georgia, and other
states, is the one encouraging sign of the awakening of some
communities to the suicidal results of this policy.

it is the [[public]] schools, however, which can be made, outside the
homes, the [[greatest]] means of training decent self-respecting [[citizens]].
we have been so hotly engaged recently in discussing trade-schools and
the higher [[education]] that the pitiable plight of the public-school
system in the south has almost dropped from view. of every five dollars
spent for [[public]] [[education]] in the [[state]] of georgia, the [[white]] schools
get four dollars and the negro one dollar; and even then the white
public-school [[system]], save in the cities [[city]], is [[bad]] and cries for reform.
if this is true of the whites, what of the blacks? i am becoming more
and more convinced, as i look upon the [[system]] of common-school training
in the south, that the national [[government]] must soon step in and aid
popular [[education]] in some way. to-day it has been only by the most
strenuous efforts on the part of the thinking [[men]] of the south that the
negro’s share of the school fund has not been cut down to a pittance in
some half-dozen states; and that movement not only is not [[dead]], but in
many communities [[community]] is gaining [[strength]]. what in the name of [[reason]] does
this nation expect of a [[people]], poorly trained and hard pressed in
severe economic competition, without [[political]] rights [[right]], and with
ludicrously inadequate common-school facilities? what can it expect but
crime and listlessness, offset here and there by the dogged struggles
of the fortunate and more determined who are themselves buoyed by the
hope that in due [[time]] the [[country]] will come to its senses?

i have thus far sought to make clear the physical, economic, and
political relations of the negroes and whites in the south, as i have
conceived them, including, for the reasons [[reason]] set forth, crime and
education. but after all that has been said on these more tangible
matters of [[human]] contact, there still remains a part essential to a
proper description of the south which it is difficult to describe or
fix in terms easily understood by strangers. it is, in fine, the
atmosphere of the [[land]], the [[thought]] and feeling, the thousand and one
little actions which go to make up [[life]]. in any [[community]] or nation it
is these little things which are most elusive to the grasp and yet most
essential to any clear conception of the group [[life]] taken as a whole.
what is thus true of all communities [[community]] is peculiarly true of the south,
where, outside of written [[history]] and outside of printed [[law]], there has
been going on for a [[generation]] as deep a storm and stress of human
souls, as intense a ferment of feeling, as intricate a writhing of
spirit, as ever a [[people]] experienced. within and without the sombre
veil of color vast social forces [[force]] have been at [[work]],—efforts for human
betterment, movements toward disintegration and despair, tragedies and
comedies in social and economic [[life]], and a swaying and lifting and
sinking of [[human]] hearts [[heart]] which have made this [[land]] a [[land]] of mingled
sorrow and joy, of [[change]] and excitement and unrest.

the centre of this [[spiritual]] turmoil has ever been the millions of
black freedmen and their sons [[son]], whose [[destiny]] is so fatefully bound up
with that of the nation. and yet the casual observer visiting the south
sees at first little of this. he notes the growing frequency of dark
faces as he rides along,—but otherwise the days slip lazily on, the sun
shines, and this little [[world]] seems as [[happy]] and contented as other
worlds he has visited. indeed, on the [[question]] of questions—the negro
problem—he hears so little that there almost seems to be a conspiracy
of [[silence]]; the morning papers seldom mention it, and then usually in a
far-fetched academic way, and indeed almost every one seems to forget
and ignore the darker half of the [[land]], until the astonished visitor is
inclined to ask if after all there is any problem here. but if he
lingers long enough there comes the awakening: perhaps in a sudden
whirl of passion which leaves him gasping at its bitter intensity; more
likely in a gradually dawning sense of things he had not at first
noticed. slowly but surely his [[eyes]] begin to catch the shadows of the
color-line: here he meets crowds of negroes and whites; then he is
suddenly aware that he cannot discover a [[single]] dark face; or again at
the close of a day’s wandering he may find himself in some strange
assembly, where all faces are tinged brown or black, and where he has
the vague, uncomfortable feeling of the stranger. he realizes at last
that silently, resistlessly, the [[world]] about flows by him in two great
streams: they ripple on in the same sunshine, they approach and mingle
their waters in seeming carelessness,—then they divide and flow wide
apart. it is done quietly; no mistakes are made, or if one occurs, the
swift arm of the [[law]] and of [[public]] [[opinion]] swings down for a moment, as
when the other day a black [[man]] and a [[white]] woman were arrested for
talking together on whitehall street in atlanta.

now if one notices carefully one will see that between these two
worlds, despite much physical contact and daily intermingling, there is
almost no [[community]] of intellectual [[life]] or point of transference where
the thoughts [[thought]] and feelings of one [[race]] can come into direct contact and
sympathy with the thoughts [[thought]] and feelings of the other. before and
directly after the [[war]], when all the [[best]] of the negroes were domestic
servants in the [[best]] of the [[white]] families [[family]], there were bonds of
intimacy, affection, and sometimes [[blood]] relationship, between the
races. they lived in the same [[home]], shared in the [[family]] [[life]], often
attended the same [[church]], and talked and conversed with each other. but
the increasing [[civilization]] of the negro since then has naturally meant
the [[development]] of higher classes: there are increasing numbers of
ministers, teachers, physicians, merchants, mechanics, and independent
farmers, who by [[nature]] and training are the [[aristocracy]] and leaders of
the blacks. between them, however, and the [[best]] element of the whites,
there is little or no intellectual commerce. they go to separate
churches, they [[live]] in separate sections, they are strictly separated
in all [[public]] gatherings, they travel separately, and they are
beginning to [[read]] different papers and books [[book]]. to most libraries,
lectures, concerts, and museums, negroes are either not admitted at
all, or on terms peculiarly galling to the [[pride]] of the very classes
who might otherwise be attracted. the daily paper chronicles the doings
of the black [[world]] from afar with no [[great]] regard for accuracy; and so
on, throughout the category of means for intellectual
communication,—schools, conferences, efforts for social betterment, and
the like,—it is usually true that the very representatives of the two
races, who for mutual benefit and the welfare of the [[land]] ought to be
in complete understanding and sympathy, are so far strangers that one
side thinks [[think]] all whites are narrow and prejudiced, and the other thinks
educated negroes dangerous and insolent. moreover, in a [[land]] where the
tyranny of [[public]] [[opinion]] and the intolerance of criticism is for
obvious historical reasons [[reason]] so [[strong]] as in the south, such a situation
is extremely difficult to [[correct]]. the [[white]] [[man]], as well as the negro,
is bound and barred by the color-line, and many a scheme of
friendliness and philanthropy, of broad-minded sympathy and generous
fellowship between the two has dropped still-born because some busybody
has forced the color-question to the front and brought the tremendous
force of unwritten [[law]] against the innovators.

it is hardly necessary for me to add very much in regard to the social
contact between the races [[race]]. nothing has come to replace that finer
sympathy and [[love]] between some masters and house servants which the
radical and more uncompromising drawing of the color-line in recent
years has caused almost completely to disappear. in a [[world]] where it
means so much to take a [[man]] by the hand and sit beside him, to look
frankly into his [[eyes]] and [[feel]] his [[heart]] beating with red [[blood]]; in a
world where a social cigar or a cup of tea together means more than
legislative halls and magazine articles and speeches [[speech]],—one can imagine
the consequences of the almost utter absence of such social amenities
between estranged races [[race]], whose separation extends even to parks and
streetcars.

here there can be none of that social going down to the [[people]],—the
opening of [[heart]] and hand of the [[best]] to the worst, in generous
acknowledgment of a [[common]] [[humanity]] and a [[common]] [[destiny]]. on the other
hand, in matters of simple almsgiving, where there can be no question
of social contact, and in the succor of the aged and sick, the south,
as if stirred by a feeling of its unfortunate limitations, is generous
to a [[fault]]. the black beggar is never turned away without a [[good]] deal
more than a crust, and a call for [[help]] for the unfortunate meets quick
response. i [[remember]], one cold winter, in atlanta, when i refrained
from contributing to a [[public]] relief fund lest negroes should be
discriminated against, i afterward inquired of a friend: “were any
black [[people]] receiving aid?” “why,” said he, “they were _all_ black.”

and yet this does not touch the kernel of the problem. human
advancement is not a mere [[question]] of almsgiving, but rather of
sympathy and cooperation among classes who would scorn charity. and
here is a [[land]] where, in the higher walks of [[life]], in all the higher
striving for the [[good]] and [[noble]] and true, the color-line comes to
separate [[natural]] [[friends]] and coworkers; while at the bottom of the
social group, in the saloon, the gambling-hell, and the brothel, that
same line wavers and disappears.

i have sought to paint an average picture of real relations between the
sons of master and [[man]] in the south. i have not glossed over matters
for policy’s sake, for i [[fear]] we have already gone too far in that sort
of thing. on the other hand, i have sincerely sought to let no unfair
exaggerations creep in. i do not [[doubt]] that in some southern
communities conditions are [[better]] than those i have indicated; while i
am no less [[certain]] that in other communities [[community]] they are far worse.

nor does the paradox and danger of this situation fail to interest and
perplex the [[best]] [[conscience]] of the south. deeply [[religious]] and
intensely democratic as are the mass of the whites, they [[feel]] acutely
the false position in which the negro problems place them. such an
essentially honest-hearted and generous [[people]] cannot cite the
caste-levelling precepts of [[christianity]], or [[believe]] in equality of
opportunity for all [[men]], without coming to [[feel]] more and more with each
generation that the [[present]] drawing of the color-line is a flat
contradiction to their beliefs and professions. but just as often as
they come to this point, the [[present]] social condition of the negro
stands as a menace and a portent before even the most open-minded: if
there were nothing to charge against the negro but his blackness or
other physical peculiarities, they argue, the problem would be
comparatively simple; but what can we say to his ignorance,
shiftlessness, [[poverty]], and crime? can a self-respecting group hold
anything but the least possible fellowship with such persons [[person]] and
survive? and shall we let a mawkish sentiment sweep away the [[culture]] of
our fathers [[father]] or the [[hope]] of our [[children]]? the argument so put is of
great [[strength]], but it is not a whit stronger than the argument of
thinking negroes: granted, they reply, that the condition of our masses
is [[bad]]; there is certainly on the one hand adequate historical cause
for this, and unmistakable evidence that no small number have, in spite
of tremendous disadvantages, risen to the level of american
civilization. and when, by proscription and prejudice, these same
negroes are classed with and treated like the lowest of their [[people]],
simply because they are negroes, such a policy not only discourages
thrift and [[intelligence]] among black [[men]], but puts a direct premium on
the very things you [[complain]] of,—inefficiency and crime. draw lines of
crime, of incompetency, of [[vice]], as tightly and uncompromisingly as you
will, for these things must be proscribed; but a color-line not only
does not accomplish this [[purpose]], but thwarts it.

in the face of two such arguments, the future of the south depends on
the ability of the representatives of these opposing views to see and
appreciate and sympathize with each other’s position,—for the negro to
realize more deeply than he does at [[present]] the need of uplifting the
masses of his [[people]], for the [[white]] [[people]] to realize more vividly than
they have yet done the deadening and disastrous effect of a
color-prejudice that classes phillis wheatley and sam hose in the same
despised class.

it is not enough for the negroes to declare that color-prejudice is the
sole cause of their social condition, nor for the [[white]] south to reply
that their social condition is the main cause of prejudice. they both
act as reciprocal cause and effect, and a [[change]] in neither alone will
bring the [[desired]] effect. both must [[change]], or neither can improve to
any [[great]] extent. the negro cannot stand the [[present]] reactionary
tendencies and unreasoning drawing of the color-line indefinitely
without discouragement and retrogression. and the condition of the
negro is ever the excuse for further discrimination. only by a union of
intelligence and sympathy across the color-line in this critical period
of the [[republic]] shall [[justice]] and [[right]] triumph,

“that [[mind]] and [[soul]] according well,
may make one [[music]] as before,
    but vaster.”

it was out in the [[country]], far from [[home]], far from my foster [[home]], on a
dark sunday night. the road wandered from our rambling log-house up the
stony bed of a creek, [[past]] wheat and corn, until we could hear dimly
across the fields a rhythmic cadence of [[song]],—soft, thrilling,
powerful, that swelled and died sorrowfully in our ears. i was a
country schoolteacher then, fresh from the east, and had never seen a
southern negro revival. to be sure, we in berkshire were not perhaps as
stiff and formal as they in suffolk of olden [[time]]; yet we were very
quiet and subdued, and i [[know]] not what would have happened those clear
sabbath mornings had some one punctuated the sermon with a wild scream,
or interrupted the long prayer with a loud amen! and so most striking
to me, as i approached the village and the little plain [[church]] perched
aloft, was the air of intense excitement that possessed that mass of
black folk. a sort of suppressed terror hung in the air and seemed to
seize us,—a pythian madness, a demoniac possession, that lent terrible
reality to [[song]] and word. the black and massive form of the preacher
swayed and quivered as the words crowded to his lips and flew at us in
singular eloquence. the [[people]] moaned and fluttered, and then the
gaunt-cheeked brown woman beside me suddenly leaped straight into the
air and shrieked like a lost [[soul]], while round about came wail and
groan and outcry, and a scene of [[human]] passion such as i had never
conceived before.

those who have not thus witnessed the frenzy of a negro revival in the
untouched backwoods of the south can but dimly realize the religious
feeling of the [[slave]]; as described, such scenes appear grotesque and
funny, but as seen they are awful. three things characterized this
religion of the [[slave]],—the preacher, the [[music]], and the frenzy. the
preacher is the most unique personality developed by the negro on
american soil. a leader, a politician, an orator, a “boss,” an
intriguer, an idealist,—all these he is, and ever, too, the centre of a
group of [[men]], now twenty, now a thousand in number. the combination of
a [[certain]] adroitness with deep-seated earnestness, of tact with
consummate ability, gave him his preeminence, and helps him maintain
it. the type, of course, varies according to [[time]] and place, from the
west indies in the sixteenth century to new [[england]] in the nineteenth,
and from the mississippi bottoms to cities [[city]] like new orleans or new
york.

the [[music]] of negro [[religion]] is that plaintive rhythmic melody, with its
touching minor cadences, which, despite caricature and defilement,
still remains the most original and beautiful expression of [[human]] life
and longing yet born on american soil. sprung from the african forests,
where its counterpart can still be heard, it was adapted, changed, and
intensified by the tragic soul-life of the [[slave]], until, under the
stress of [[law]] and whip, it became the one true expression of a people’s
sorrow, despair, and [[hope]].

finally the frenzy of “shouting,” when the spirit of the [[lord]] passed
by, and, seizing the devotee, made him mad with supernatural joy, was
the [[last]] essential of negro [[religion]] and the one more devoutly believed
in than all the rest. it varied in expression from the silent rapt
countenance or the low murmur and moan to the mad abandon of physical
fervor,—the stamping, shrieking, and shouting, the rushing to and fro
and wild waving of arms, the weeping and laughing, the vision and the
trance. all this is nothing new in the [[world]], but old as [[religion]], as
delphi and endor. and so firm a hold did it have on the negro, that
many generations [[generation]] firmly believed that without this visible
manifestation of the [[god]] there could be no true communion with the
invisible.

these were the characteristics of negro [[religious]] [[life]] as developed up
to the [[time]] of emancipation. since under the peculiar circumstances of
the black man’s environment they were the one expression of his higher
life, they are of deep interest to the student of his [[development]], both
socially and psychologically. numerous are the attractive lines of
inquiry that here group themselves. what did [[slavery]] mean to the
african savage? what was his attitude toward the [[world]] and [[life]]? what
seemed to him [[good]] and [[evil]],—god and [[devil]]? whither went his longings
and strivings, and wherefore were his heart-burnings and
disappointments? answers [[answer]] to such questions [[question]] can come only from a study
of negro [[religion]] as a [[development]], through its gradual changes [[change]] from
the heathenism of the gold coast to the institutional negro [[church]] of
chicago.

moreover, the [[religious]] [[growth]] of millions of [[men]], even though they be
slaves, cannot be without potent influence upon their contemporaries.
the methodists and baptists of [[america]] owe much of their condition to
the silent but potent influence of their millions of negro converts.
especially is this noticeable in the south, where theology and
religious [[philosophy]] are on this account a long way behind the north,
and where the [[religion]] of the [[poor]] whites is a plain copy of negro
thought and methods. the mass of “gospel” hymns which has swept through
american churches [[church]] and well-nigh ruined our sense of [[song]] consists
largely of debased imitations of negro melodies made by ears that
caught the jingle but not the [[music]], the [[body]] but not the [[soul]], of the
jubilee songs [[song]]. it is thus clear that the study of negro [[religion]] is not
only a vital part of the [[history]] of the negro in [[america]], but no
uninteresting part of american [[history]].

the negro [[church]] of to-day is the social centre of negro [[life]] in the
united states, and the most characteristic expression of african
character. take a typical [[church]] in a small virginia town: it is the
“first baptist’—a roomy brick edifice seating five hundred or more
persons, tastefully finished in georgia pine, with a carpet, a small
organ, and stained-glass windows. underneath is a large assembly room
with benches. this building is the central club-house of a [[community]] of
a thousand or more negroes. various organizations meet here,—the church
proper, the sunday-school, two or three insurance societies [[society]], women’s
societies, secret societies [[society]], and mass meetings of various kinds [[kind]].
entertainments, suppers, and lectures are held beside the five or six
regular weekly [[religious]] services. considerable sums of [[money]] are
collected and expended here, employment is found for the idle,
strangers are introduced, news is disseminated and charity distributed.
at the same [[time]] this social, intellectual, and economic centre is a
religious centre of [[great]] [[power]]. depravity, [[sin]], redemption, [[heaven]],
hell, and damnation are preached twice a sunday after the crops are
laid by; and few indeed of the [[community]] have the hardihood to
withstand conversion. back of this more formal [[religion]], the church
often stands as a real conserver of morals [[moral]], a strengthener of family
life, and the final [[authority]] on what is [[good]] and [[right]].

thus one can see in the negro [[church]] to-day, reproduced in microcosm,
all the [[great]] [[world]] from which the negro is cut off by color-prejudice
and social condition. in the [[great]] [[city]] churches [[church]] the same tendency is
noticeable and in many respects [[respect]] emphasized. a [[great]] [[church]] like the
bethel of philadelphia has over eleven hundred members, an edifice
seating fifteen hundred persons [[person]] and valued at one hundred thousand
dollars, an annual budget of five thousand dollars, and a government
consisting of a pastor with several assisting local preachers, an
executive and legislative board, financial boards and tax collectors;
general [[church]] meetings for making laws [[law]]; sub-divided groups [[led]] by
class leaders, a company of militia, and twenty-four auxiliary
societies. the activity of a [[church]] like this is immense and
far-reaching, and the bishops who preside over these organizations
throughout the [[land]] are among the most powerful negro rulers in the
world.

such churches [[church]] are really governments [[government]] of [[men]], and consequently a little
investigation reveals the [[curious]] [[fact]] that, in the south, at least,
practically every american negro is a [[church]] member. some, to be sure,
are not regularly enrolled, and a few do not habitually attend
services; but, practically, a proscribed [[people]] must have a social
centre, and that centre for this [[people]] is the negro [[church]]. the census
of 1890 showed nearly twenty-four thousand negro churches [[church]] in the
country, with a total enrolled membership of over two and a half
millions, or ten actual [[church]] members to every twenty-eight persons [[person]],
and in some southern states one in every two persons [[person]]. besides these
there is the large number who, while not enrolled as members, attend
and take part in many of the activities of the [[church]]. there is an
organized negro [[church]] for every sixty black families [[family]] in the nation,
and in some states for every forty families [[family]], owning, on an average, a
thousand dollars’ worth of [[property]] each, or nearly twenty-six million
dollars in all.

such, then, is the large [[development]] of the negro [[church]] since
emancipation. the [[question]] now is, what have been the successive steps
of this social [[history]] and what are the [[present]] tendencies? first, we
must realize that no such institution as the negro [[church]] could rear
itself without definite historical foundations. these foundations we
can find if we [[remember]] that the social [[history]] of the negro did not
start in [[america]]. he was brought from a definite social
environment,—the polygamous clan [[life]] under the headship of the chief
and the potent influence of the [[priest]]. his [[religion]] was
nature-worship, with profound [[belief]] in invisible surrounding
influences, [[good]] and [[bad]], and his [[worship]] was through incantation and
sacrifice. the first rude [[change]] in this [[life]] was the [[slave]] ship and
the west [[indian]] sugar-fields. the plantation organization replaced the
clan and tribe, and the [[white]] master replaced the [[chief]] with far
greater and more despotic powers [[power]]. forced and long-continued toil became
the [[rule]] of [[life]], the old ties of [[blood]] relationship and kinship
disappeared, and instead of the [[family]] appeared a new polygamy and
polyandry, which, in some cases, almost reached promiscuity. it was a
terrific social [[revolution]], and yet some traces were retained of the
former group [[life]], and the [[chief]] remaining institution was the priest
or medicine-man. he early appeared on the plantation and found his
function as the healer of the sick, the interpreter of the unknown, the
comforter of the sorrowing, the supernatural avenger of [[wrong]], and the
one who rudely but picturesquely expressed the longing, disappointment,
and resentment of a stolen and [[oppressed]] [[people]]. thus, as bard,
physician, [[judge]], and [[priest]], within the narrow limits allowed by the
slave [[system]], rose the negro preacher, and under him the first church
was not at first by any means [[christian]] nor definitely organized;
rather it was an adaptation and mingling of heathen rites among the
members of each plantation, and roughly designated as voodooism.
association with the masters, missionary effort and motives of
expediency gave these rites an early veneer of [[christianity]], and after
the lapse of many generations [[generation]] the negro [[church]] became [[christian]].

two characteristic things must be noticed in regard to the [[church]].
first, it became almost entirely baptist and methodist in [[faith]];
secondly, as a social institution it antedated by many decades the
monogamic negro [[home]]. from the very circumstances of its beginning, the
church was confined to the plantation, and consisted primarily of a
series of disconnected units; although, later on, some [[freedom]] of
movement was allowed, still this geographical limitation was always
important and was one cause of the spread of the decentralized and
democratic baptist [[faith]] among the slaves [[slave]]. at the same [[time]], the
visible rite of baptism appealed strongly to their mystic temperament.
to-day the baptist [[church]] is still largest in membership among negroes,
and has a million and a half communicants. next in popularity came the
churches organized in connection with the [[white]] neighboring churches [[church]],
chiefly baptist and methodist, with a few episcopalian and others. the
methodists still form the second [[greatest]] denomination, with nearly a
million members. the [[faith]] of these two leading denominations was more
suited to the [[slave]] [[church]] from the prominence they gave to religious
feeling and fervor. the negro membership in other denominations has
always been small and relatively unimportant, although the
episcopalians and presbyterians are gaining among the more intelligent
classes to-day, and the catholic [[church]] is making headway in certain
sections. after emancipation, and still earlier in the north, the negro
churches largely severed such affiliations as they had had with the
white churches [[church]], either by [[choice]] or by compulsion. the baptist churches
became independent, but the methodists were compelled early to unite
for purposes [[purpose]] of episcopal [[government]]. this gave rise to the great
african methodist [[church]], the [[greatest]] negro organization in the [[world]],
to the zion [[church]] and the colored methodist, and to the black
conferences and churches [[church]] in this and other denominations.

the second [[fact]] noted, namely, that the negro [[church]] antedates the
negro [[home]], leads to an explanation of much that is paradoxical in this
communistic institution and in the morals [[moral]] of its members. but
especially it leads us to regard this institution as peculiarly the
expression of the inner ethical [[life]] of a [[people]] in a sense seldom true
elsewhere. let us turn, then, from the outer physical [[development]] of
the [[church]] to the more important inner ethical [[life]] of the [[people]] who
compose it. the negro has already been pointed out many times [[time]] as a
religious animal,—a being of that deep emotional [[nature]] which turns
instinctively toward the supernatural. endowed with a [[rich]] tropical
imagination and a keen, delicate appreciation of [[nature]], the
transplanted african lived in a [[world]] animate with gods and devils [[devil]],
elves and witches; full of [[strange]] influences,—of [[good]] to be implored,
of [[evil]] to be propitiated. [[slavery]], then, was to him the dark triumph
of [[evil]] over him. all the hateful powers [[power]] of the under-world were
striving against him, and a spirit of revolt and [[revenge]] filled his
heart. he called up all the resources of heathenism to aid,—exorcism
and witch-craft, the mysterious obi [[worship]] with its barbarious rites,
spells, and blood-sacrifice even, now and then, of [[human]] victims. weird
midnight orgies and mystic conjurations were invoked, the witch-woman
and the voodoo-priest became the centre of negro group [[life]], and that
vein of vague superstition which characterizes the unlettered negro
even to-day was deepened and strengthened.

in spite, however, of such [[success]] as that of the fierce maroons, the
danish blacks, and others, the spirit of revolt gradually died away
under the untiring energy and superior [[strength]] of the [[slave]] masters.
by the middle of the eighteenth century the black [[slave]] had sunk, with
hushed murmurs, to his place at the bottom of a new economic [[system]],
and was unconsciously ripe for a new [[philosophy]] of [[life]]. nothing suited
his condition then [[better]] than the doctrines of passive submission
embodied in the newly learned [[christianity]]. [[slave]] masters early
realized this, and cheerfully aided [[religious]] propaganda within certain
bounds. the long [[system]] of repression and degradation of the negro
tended to emphasize the elements of his [[character]] which made him a
valuable chattel: courtesy became [[humility]], [[moral]] [[strength]] degenerated
into submission, and the exquisite native appreciation of the beautiful
became an infinite capacity for dumb suffering. the negro, losing the
joy of this [[world]], eagerly seized upon the offered conceptions of the
next; the avenging spirit of the [[lord]] enjoining patience in this [[world]],
under [[sorrow]] and tribulation until the [[great]] day when he should lead
his dark [[children]] [[home]],—this became his comforting [[dream]]. his preacher
repeated the prophecy, and his bards sang,—

“children, we all shall be free
when the [[lord]] shall appear!”


this deep [[religious]] fatalism, painted so beautifully in “uncle tom,”
came soon to breed, as all fatalistic faiths will, the sensualist side
by side with the martyr. under the lax [[moral]] [[life]] of the plantation,
where [[marriage]] was a farce, laziness a [[virtue]], and [[property]] a theft, a
religion of resignation and submission degenerated easily, in less
strenuous minds [[mind]], into a [[philosophy]] of indulgence and crime. many of the
worst characteristics of the negro masses of to-day had their seed in
this period of the slave’s ethical [[growth]]. here it was that the home
was ruined under the very shadow of the [[church]], [[white]] and black; here
habits of shiftlessness took root, and sullen hopelessness replaced
hopeful strife.

with the beginning of the abolition movement and the gradual [[growth]] of
a class of [[free]] negroes came a [[change]]. we often neglect the influence
of the freedman before the [[war]], because of the paucity of his numbers
and the small weight he had in the [[history]] of the nation. but we must
not forget that his [[chief]] influence was internal,—was exerted on the
black [[world]]; and that there he was the ethical and social leader.
huddled as he was in a few centres like philadelphia, new york, and new
orleans, the masses of the freedmen sank into [[poverty]] and listlessness;
but not all of them. the [[free]] negro leader early arose and his chief
characteristic was intense earnestness and deep feeling on the slavery
question. [[freedom]] became to him a real thing and not a [[dream]]. his
religion became darker and more intense, and into his ethics crept a
note of [[revenge]], into his songs [[song]] a day of reckoning close at hand. the
“coming of the lord” swept this side of [[death]], and came to be a thing
to be hoped for in this day. through fugitive slaves [[slave]] and irrepressible
discussion this [[desire]] for [[freedom]] seized the black millions still in
bondage, and became their one ideal of [[life]]. the black bards caught new
notes, and sometimes even dared to sing,—

“o [[freedom]], o [[freedom]], o [[freedom]] over me!
before i’ll be a slave
i’ll be buried in my grave,
and go [[home]] to my lord
and be [[free]].”


for fifty years negro [[religion]] thus transformed itself and identified
itself with the [[dream]] of abolition, until that which was a radical fad
in the [[white]] north and an anarchistic plot in the [[white]] south had
become a [[religion]] to the black [[world]]. thus, when emancipation finally
came, it seemed to the freedman a literal coming of the [[lord]]. his
fervid [[imagination]] was stirred as never before, by the tramp of armies [[army]],
the [[blood]] and dust of [[battle]], and the wail and whirl of social
upheaval. he stood dumb and motionless before the whirlwind: what had
he to do with it? was it not the lord’s doing, and marvellous in his
eyes? joyed and bewildered with what came, he stood awaiting new
wonders till the inevitable [[age]] of reaction swept over the nation and
brought the crisis of to-day.

it is difficult to explain clearly the [[present]] critical stage of negro
religion. first, we must [[remember]] that living as the blacks do in close
contact with a [[great]] [[modern]] nation, and sharing, although imperfectly,
the soul-life of that nation, they must necessarily be affected more or
less directly by all the [[religious]] and ethical forces [[force]] that are to-day
moving the [[united]] states. these questions [[question]] and movements are, however,
overshadowed and dwarfed by the (to them) all-important [[question]] of
their civil, [[political]], and economic status. they must perpetually
discuss the “negro problem,”—must [[live]], move, and have their being in
it, and interpret all else in its [[light]] or darkness. with this come,
too, peculiar problems of their inner [[life]],—of the status of [[women]], the
maintenance of [[home]], the training of [[children]], the accumulation of
wealth, and the prevention of crime. all this must mean a [[time]] of
intense ethical ferment, of [[religious]] heart-searching and intellectual
unrest. from the double [[life]] every american negro must [[live]], as a negro
and as an american, as swept on by the current of the nineteenth while
yet struggling in the eddies of the fifteenth century,—from this must
arise a painful self-consciousness, an almost morbid sense of
personality and a [[moral]] hesitancy which is fatal to self-confidence.
the worlds [[world]] within and without the veil of color are changing, and
changing rapidly, but not at the same rate, not in the same way; and
this must [[produce]] a peculiar wrenching of the [[soul]], a peculiar sense of
doubt and bewilderment. such a double [[life]], with double thoughts [[thought]],
double duties [[duty]], and double social classes, must give rise to double
words and double ideals, and tempt the [[mind]] to pretence or revolt, to
hypocrisy or radicalism.

in some such doubtful words and phrases can one perhaps most clearly
picture the peculiar ethical paradox that faces the negro of to-day and
is tingeing and changing his [[religious]] [[life]]. feeling that his rights
and his dearest ideals are being trampled upon, that the public
conscience is ever more deaf to his righteous appeal, and that all the
reactionary forces [[force]] of prejudice, greed, and [[revenge]] are daily gaining
new [[strength]] and fresh allies, the negro faces no enviable dilemma.
conscious of his impotence, and pessimistic, he often becomes bitter
and vindictive; and his [[religion]], instead of a [[worship]], is a complaint
and a curse, a wail rather than a [[hope]], a sneer rather than a [[faith]]. on
the other hand, another type of [[mind]], shrewder and keener and more
tortuous too, sees in the very [[strength]] of the anti-negro movement its
patent weaknesses, and with jesuitic casuistry is deterred by no
ethical considerations in the endeavor to turn this weakness to the
black man’s [[strength]]. thus we have two [[great]] and hardly reconcilable
streams of [[thought]] and ethical strivings; the danger of the one lies [[lie]] in
anarchy, that of the other in hypocrisy. the one type of negro stands
almost ready to curse [[god]] and [[die]], and the other is too often found a
traitor to [[right]] and a [[coward]] before [[force]]; the one is wedded to ideals
remote, whimsical, perhaps impossible of realization; the other forgets
that [[life]] is more than meat and the [[body]] more than raiment. but, after
all, is not this simply the writhing of the [[age]] translated into
black,—the triumph of the [[lie]] which today, with its false [[culture]],
faces the hideousness of the anarchist assassin?

to-day the two groups of negroes, the one in the north, the other in
the south, represent these divergent ethical tendencies, the first
tending toward radicalism, the other toward hypocritical compromise. it
is no idle regret with which the [[white]] south mourns the loss of the
old-time negro,—the frank, honest, simple old servant who stood for the
earlier [[religious]] [[age]] of submission and [[humility]]. with all his laziness
and lack of many elements of true manhood, he was at least
open-hearted, faithful, and sincere. to-day he is gone, but who is to
blame for his going? is it not those very persons [[person]] who mourn for him? is
it not the tendency, born of reconstruction and reaction, to found a
society on lawlessness and deception, to tamper with the [[moral]] fibre of
a naturally honest and straightforward [[people]] until the whites threaten
to become ungovernable tyrants [[tyrant]] and the blacks criminals [[criminal]] and hypocrites?
deception is the [[natural]] defence of the [[weak]] against the [[strong]], and
the south used it for many years against its conquerors; to-day it must
be prepared to see its black proletariat turn that same two-edged
weapon against itself. and how [[natural]] this is! the [[death]] of denmark
vesey and nat turner proved long since to the negro the present
hopelessness of physical defence. [[political]] defence is becoming less
and less available, and economic defence is still only partially
effective. but there is a patent defence at hand,—the defence of
deception and [[flattery]], of cajoling and lying. it is the same defence
which peasants of the middle [[age]] used and which left its stamp on their
character for centuries. to-day the [[young]] negro of the south who would
succeed cannot be frank and outspoken, honest and self-assertive, but
rather he is daily tempted to be silent and wary, [[politic]] and sly; he
must flatter and be pleasant, endure petty insults with a smile, shut
his [[eyes]] to [[wrong]]; in too many cases he sees positive personal
advantage in deception and lying. his real thoughts [[thought]], his real
aspirations, must be guarded in whispers; he must not criticise, he
must not [[complain]]. patience, [[humility]], and adroitness must, in these
growing black [[youth]], replace impulse, manliness, and [[courage]]. with this
sacrifice there is an economic opening, and perhaps [[peace]] and some
prosperity. without this there is riot, migration, or crime. nor is
this situation peculiar to the southern [[united]] states, is it not rather
the only method by which undeveloped races [[race]] have gained the [[right]] to
share [[modern]] [[culture]]? the price of [[culture]] is a [[lie]].

on the other hand, in the north the tendency is to emphasize the
radicalism of the negro. driven from his birthright in the south by a
situation at which every fibre of his more outspoken and assertive
nature revolts, he finds himself in a [[land]] where he can scarcely earn a
decent living amid the harsh competition and the color discrimination.
at the same [[time]], through schools and periodicals, discussions and
lectures, he is intellectually quickened and awakened. the [[soul]], long
pent up and dwarfed, suddenly expands in new-found [[freedom]]. what wonder
that every tendency is to excess,—radical complaint, radical remedies,
bitter denunciation or angry [[silence]]. some sink, some rise. the
criminal and the sensualist leave the [[church]] for the gambling-hell and
the brothel, and fill the slums of chicago and baltimore; the better
classes segregate themselves from the group-life of both [[white]] and
black, and form an [[aristocracy]], cultured but pessimistic, whose bitter
criticism stings while it points out no way of escape. they despise the
submission and subserviency of the southern negroes, but offer no other
means by which a [[poor]] and [[oppressed]] minority can [[exist]] side by side
with its masters. feeling deeply and keenly the tendencies and
opportunities of the [[age]] in which they [[live]], their souls [[soul]] are bitter at
the [[fate]] which drops the veil between; and the very [[fact]] that this
bitterness is [[natural]] and justifiable only serves to intensify it and
make it more maddening.

between the two extreme types of ethical attitude which i have thus
sought to make clear wavers the mass of the millions of negroes, north
and south; and their [[religious]] [[life]] and activity partake of this social
conflict within their ranks. their churches [[church]] are differentiating,—now
into groups of cold, fashionable devotees, in no way distinguishable
from similar [[white]] groups save in color of skin; now into large social
and [[business]] [[institutions]] catering to the [[desire]] for information and
amusement of their members, warily avoiding unpleasant questions [[question]] both
within and without the black [[world]], and preaching in effect if not in
word: _dum vivimus, vivamus_.

but back of this still broods silently the deep [[religious]] feeling of
the real negro [[heart]], the stirring, unguided might of powerful human
souls who have lost the guiding star of the [[past]] and seek in the great
night a new [[religious]] ideal. some day the awakening will come, when the
pent-up vigor of ten million souls [[soul]] shall sweep irresistibly toward the
goal, out of the valley of the shadow of [[death]], where all that makes
life worth living—liberty, [[justice]], and right—is marked “for white
people only.”




xi.
of the passing of the first-born

o sister, sister, thy first-begotten,
the hands that cling and the feet that [[follow]],
the voice of the child’s [[blood]] crying yet,
_who hath remembered me? who hath forgotten?_
thou hast forgotten, o summer swallow,
but the [[world]] shall end when i forget.

“unto you a child is born,” sang the bit of yellow paper that fluttered
into my room one brown october morning. then the [[fear]] of fatherhood
mingled wildly with the joy of creation; i wondered how it looked and
how it felt—what were its [[eyes]], and how its hair curled and crumpled
itself. and i [[thought]] in awe of her,—she who had slept with [[death]] to
tear a man-child from underneath her [[heart]], while i was unconsciously
wandering. i fled to my [[wife]] and child, repeating the while to myself
half wonderingly, “wife and child? [[wife]] and child?”—fled fast and
faster than boat and steam-car, and yet must ever impatiently await
them; away from the hard-voiced [[city]], away from the flickering sea into
my own berkshire hills that sit all sadly guarding the gates of
massachusetts.

up the stairs i ran to the wan [[mother]] and whimpering babe, to the
sanctuary on whose altar a [[life]] at my bidding had offered itself to win
a [[life]], and won. what is this tiny formless thing, this newborn wail
from an unknown [[world]],—all head and voice? i handle it curiously, and
watch perplexed its winking, breathing, and sneezing. i did not [[love]] it
then; it seemed a ludicrous thing to [[love]]; but her i loved, my
girl-mother, she whom now i saw unfolding like the [[glory]] of the
morning—the transfigured woman. through her i came to [[love]] the wee
thing, as it grew [[strong]]; as its little [[soul]] unfolded itself in twitter
and cry and half-formed word, and as its [[eyes]] caught the gleam and
flash of [[life]]. how beautiful he was, with his olive-tinted flesh and
dark gold ringlets, his [[eyes]] of mingled blue and brown, his perfect
little limbs, and the soft voluptuous roll which the [[blood]] of africa
had moulded into his features! i held him in my arms, after we had sped
far away from our southern [[home]],—held him, and glanced at the hot red
soil of georgia and the breathless [[city]] of a hundred hills, and [[felt]] a
vague unrest. why was his hair tinted with gold? an [[evil]] omen was
golden hair in my [[life]]. why had not the brown of his [[eyes]] crushed out
and killed the blue?—for brown were his father’s [[eyes]], and his father’s
father’s. and thus in the [[land]] of the color-line i saw, as it fell
across my baby, the shadow of the veil.

within the veil was he born, said i; and there within shall he [[live]],—a
negro and a negro’s [[son]]. holding in that little head—ah, bitterly!—he
unbowed [[pride]] of a hunted [[race]], clinging with that tiny dimpled
hand—ah, wearily!—to a [[hope]] not hopeless but unhopeful, and seeing with
those bright wondering [[eyes]] that peer into my [[soul]] a [[land]] whose freedom
is to us a mockery and whose [[liberty]] a [[lie]]. i saw the shadow of the
veil as it passed over my baby, i saw the cold [[city]] towering above the
blood-red [[land]]. i held my face beside his little cheek, showed him the
star-children and the twinkling lights [[light]] as they began to flash, and
stilled with an even-song the unvoiced terror of my [[life]].

so sturdy and masterful he grew, so filled with bubbling [[life]], so
tremulous with the unspoken [[wisdom]] of a [[life]] but eighteen months
distant from the all-life,—we were not far from worshipping this
revelation of the [[divine]], my [[wife]] and i. her own [[life]] builded and
moulded itself upon the child; he tinged her every [[dream]] and idealized
her every effort. no hands but hers must touch and garnish those little
limbs; no dress or frill must touch them that had not wearied her
fingers; no voice but hers could coax him off to dreamland, and she and
he together spoke some soft and unknown tongue and in it held
communion. i too mused above his little [[white]] bed; saw the [[strength]] of
my own arm stretched onward through the ages [[age]] through the newer strength
of his; saw the [[dream]] of my black fathers [[father]] stagger a step onward in the
wild phantasm of the [[world]]; heard in his baby voice the voice of the
prophet that was to rise within the veil.

and so we dreamed and loved and planned by fall and winter, and the
full flush of the long southern spring, till the hot winds rolled from
the fetid gulf, till the roses shivered and the still stern sun
quivered its awful [[light]] over the hills of atlanta. and then one night
the little feet pattered wearily to the wee [[white]] bed, and the tiny
hands trembled; and a warm flushed face tossed on the pillow, and we
knew baby was sick. ten days he lay there,—a swift week and three
endless days, wasting, wasting away. cheerily the [[mother]] nursed him the
first days, and laughed into the little [[eyes]] that smiled again.
tenderly then she hovered round him, till the smile fled away and fear
crouched beside the little bed.

then the day ended not, and night was a dreamless terror, and joy and
sleep slipped away. i hear now that voice at midnight calling me from
dull and dreamless trance,—crying, “the shadow of death! the shadow of
death!” out into the starlight i crept, to rouse the gray
physician,—the shadow of [[death]], the shadow of [[death]]. the hours trembled
on; the night listened; the ghastly dawn glided like a tired thing
across the lamplight. then we two alone looked upon the child as he
turned toward us with [[great]] [[eyes]], and stretched his stringlike
hands,—the shadow of death! and we spoke no word, and turned away.

he died at eventide, when the sun lay like a brooding [[sorrow]] above the
western hills, veiling its face; when the winds spoke not, and the
trees, the [[great]] green trees he loved, stood motionless. i saw his
breath beat quicker and quicker, pause, and then his little [[soul]] leapt
like a star that travels in the night and left a [[world]] of darkness in
its train. the day changed not; the same tall trees peeped in at the
windows, the same green grass glinted in the setting sun. only in the
chamber of [[death]] writhed the world’s most piteous thing—a childless
mother.

i shirk not. i long for [[work]]. i pant for a [[life]] full of striving. i am
no [[coward]], to shrink before the rugged rush of the storm, nor even
quail before the awful shadow of the veil. but hearken, o death! is not
this my [[life]] hard enough,—is not that dull [[land]] that stretches its
sneering web about me cold enough,—is not all the [[world]] beyond these
four little walls pitiless enough, but that thou must needs enter
here,—thou, o [[death]]? about my head the thundering storm beat like a
heartless voice, and the crazy forest pulsed with the curses of the
weak; but what cared i, within my [[home]] beside my [[wife]] and baby boy?
wast thou so [[jealous]] of one little coign of [[happiness]] that thou must
needs enter there,—thou, o [[death]]?

a [[perfect]] [[life]] was his, all joy and [[love]], with tears to make it
brighter,—sweet as a summer’s day beside the housatonic. the world
loved him; the [[women]] kissed his curls, the [[men]] looked gravely into his
wonderful [[eyes]], and the [[children]] hovered and fluttered about him. i can
see him now, changing like the [[sky]] from sparkling laughter to darkening
frowns, and then to wondering thoughtfulness as he watched the [[world]].
he knew no color-line, [[poor]] dear—and the veil, though it shadowed him,
had not yet darkened half his sun. he loved the [[white]] matron, he loved
his black nurse; and in his little [[world]] walked souls [[soul]] alone, uncolored
and unclothed. i—yea, all men—are larger and purer by the infinite
breadth of that one little [[life]]. she who in simple clearness of vision
sees beyond the stars said when he had flown, “he will be [[happy]] there;
he ever loved beautiful things.” and i, far more ignorant, and blind by
the web of mine own weaving, sit alone winding words and muttering, “if
still he be, and he be there, and there be a there, let him be [[happy]], o
fate!”

blithe was the morning of his burial, with bird and [[song]] and
sweet-smelling flowers. the trees whispered to the grass, but the
children sat with hushed faces. and yet it seemed a ghostly unreal
day,—the wraith of [[life]]. we seemed to rumble down an unknown street
behind a little [[white]] bundle of posies, with the shadow of a [[song]] in
our ears. the busy [[city]] dinned about us; they did not say much, those
pale-faced hurrying [[men]] and [[women]]; they did not say much,—they only
glanced and said, “niggers!”

we could not lay him in the ground there in georgia, for the earth
there is strangely red; so we bore him away to the northward, with his
flowers and his little folded hands. in [[vain]], in vain!—for where, o
god! beneath thy broad blue [[sky]] shall my dark baby rest in [[peace]],—where
reverence dwells, and goodness, and a [[freedom]] that is [[free]]?

all that day and all that night there sat an awful gladness in my
heart,—nay, blame me not if i see the [[world]] thus darkly through the
veil,—and my [[soul]] whispers ever to me saying, “not [[dead]], not [[dead]], but
escaped; not bond, but [[free]].” no bitter meanness now shall sicken his
baby [[heart]] till it [[die]] a living [[death]], no taunt shall madden his happy
boyhood. [[fool]] that i was to [[think]] or [[wish]] that this little [[soul]] should
grow choked and deformed within the veil! i might have known that
yonder deep unworldly look that ever and anon floated [[past]] his [[eyes]] was
peering far beyond this narrow now. in the poise of his little
curl-crowned head did there not sit all that wild [[pride]] of being which
his [[father]] had hardly crushed in his own [[heart]]? for what, forsooth,
shall a negro want with [[pride]] amid the [[studied]] humiliations of fifty
million fellows? well sped, my boy, before the [[world]] had dubbed your
ambition insolence, had held your ideals unattainable, and taught you
to cringe and bow. [[better]] far this nameless void that stops my life
than a sea of [[sorrow]] for you.

idle words; he might have borne his burden more bravely than we,—aye,
and found it lighter too, some day; for surely, surely this is not the
end. surely there shall yet dawn some mighty morning to lift the veil
and set the prisoned [[free]]. not for me,—i shall [[die]] in my bonds,—but for
fresh [[young]] souls [[soul]] who have not known the night and waken to the
morning; a morning when [[men]] ask of the workman, not “is he [[white]]?” but
“can he [[work]]?” when [[men]] ask artists, not “are they black?” but “do they
know?” some morning this may be, long, long years to come. but now
there wails, on that dark shore within the veil, the same deep voice,
_thou shalt forego!_ and all have i foregone at that command, and with
small complaint,—all save that [[fair]] [[young]] form that lies [[lie]] so coldly wed
with [[death]] in the nest i had builded.

if one must have gone, why not i? why may i not rest me from this
restlessness and sleep from this wide waking? was not the world’s
alembic, [[time]], in his [[young]] hands, and is not my [[time]] waning? are there
so many workers in the vineyard that the [[fair]] promise of this little
body could lightly be tossed away? the wretched of my [[race]] that line
the alleys of the nation sit fatherless and unmothered; but [[love]] sat
beside his cradle, and in his ear [[wisdom]] waited to speak. perhaps now
he knows [[know]] the all-love, and needs not to be [[wise]]. sleep, then,
child,—sleep till i sleep and waken to a baby voice and the ceaseless
patter of little feet—above the veil.

of alexander crummell

then from the dawn it seemed there came, but faint
as from beyond the limit of the [[world]],
like the [[last]] echo born of a [[great]] cry,
sounds, as if some [[fair]] [[city]] were one voice
around a [[king]] returning from his wars [[war]].

[illustration]


this is the story of a [[human]] [[heart]],—the tale of a black boy who many
long years ago began to struggle with [[life]] that he might [[know]] the world
and [[know]] himself. three temptations he met on those dark dunes that lay
gray and dismal before the wonder-eyes of the child: the temptation of
hate, that stood out against the red dawn; the temptation of despair,
that darkened noonday; and the temptation of [[doubt]], that ever steals
along with twilight. above all, you must hear of the vales he
crossed,—the valley of humiliation and the valley of the shadow of
death.

i saw alexander crummell first at a wilberforce commencement season,
amid its bustle and crush. tall, frail, and black he stood, with simple
dignity and an unmistakable air of [[good]] breeding. i talked with him
apart, where the storming of the lusty [[young]] orators could not harm us.
i spoke to him politely, then curiously, then eagerly, as i began to
feel the fineness of his [[character]],—his calm courtesy, the sweetness of
his [[strength]], and his [[fair]] blending of the [[hope]] and [[truth]] of [[life]].
instinctively i bowed before this [[man]], as one bows before the prophets
of the [[world]]. some seer he seemed, that came not from the crimson past
or the gray to-come, but from the pulsing now,—that mocking [[world]] which
seemed to me at once so [[light]] and dark, so splendid and sordid.
fourscore years had he wandered in this same [[world]] of mine, within the
veil.

he was born with the missouri compromise and lay a-dying amid the
echoes of manila and el caney: stirring times [[time]] for living, times [[time]] dark to
look back upon, darker to look forward to. the black-faced lad that
paused over his mud and marbles seventy years ago saw puzzling vistas
as he looked down the [[world]]. the slave-ship still groaned across the
atlantic, faint cries burdened the southern breeze, and the [[great]] black
father whispered mad tales of [[cruelty]] into those [[young]] ears. from the
low doorway the [[mother]] silently watched her boy at play, and at
nightfall sought him eagerly lest the shadows bear him away to the land
of slaves [[slave]].

so his [[young]] [[mind]] worked and winced and shaped curiously a vision of
life; and in the midst of that vision ever stood one dark figure
alone,—ever with the hard, thick countenance of that bitter [[father]], and
a form that fell in vast and shapeless folds. thus the temptation of
hate grew and shadowed the growing child,—gliding stealthily into his
laughter, fading into his play, and seizing his dreams [[dream]] by day and night
with rough, rude turbulence. so the black boy [[asked]] of [[sky]] and sun and
flower the never-answered why? and loved, as he grew, neither the world
nor the world’s rough ways.

strange temptation for a child, you may [[think]]; and yet in this wide
land to-day a thousand thousand dark [[children]] brood before this same
temptation, and [[feel]] its cold and shuddering arms. for them, perhaps,
some one will some day lift the veil,—will come tenderly and cheerily
into those [[sad]] little lives [[life]] and brush the brooding hate away, just as
beriah green strode in upon the [[life]] of alexander crummell. and before
the bluff, kind-hearted [[man]] the shadow seemed less dark. beriah green
had a school in oneida county, new york, with a score of mischievous
boys. “i’m going to bring a black boy here to educate,” said beriah
green, as only a crank and an abolitionist would have dared to say.
“oho!” laughed the boys. “ye-es,” said his [[wife]]; and alexander came.
once before, the black boy had sought a school, had travelled, cold and
hungry, four hundred miles up into [[free]] new hampshire, to canaan. but
the godly farmers [[farmer]] hitched ninety yoke of oxen to the abolition
schoolhouse and dragged it into the middle of the swamp. the black boy
trudged away.

the nineteenth was the first century of [[human]] sympathy,—the [[age]] when
half wonderingly we began to descry in others that transfigured spark
of divinity which we call myself; when clodhoppers and peasants, and
tramps and thieves, and millionaires and—sometimes—negroes, became
throbbing souls [[soul]] whose warm pulsing [[life]] touched us so nearly that we
half gasped with surprise, crying, “thou too! hast thou seen [[sorrow]] and
the dull waters of hopelessness? hast thou known [[life]]?” and then all
helplessly we peered into those other-worlds, and wailed, “o [[world]] of
worlds, how shall [[man]] make you one?”

so in that little oneida school there came to those schoolboys a
revelation of [[thought]] and longing beneath one black skin, of which they
had not dreamed before. and to the lonely boy came a new dawn of
sympathy and inspiration. the shadowy, formless thing—the temptation of
hate, that hovered between him and the world—grew fainter and less
sinister. it did not wholly fade away, but diffused itself and lingered
thick at the edges. through it the child now first saw the blue and
gold of [[life]],—the sun-swept road that ran ’twixt [[heaven]] and [[earth]] until
in one far-off wan wavering line they met and kissed. a vision of life
came to the growing boy,—mystic, wonderful. he raised his head,
stretched himself, breathed deep of the fresh new air. yonder, behind
the forests, he heard [[strange]] sounds; then glinting through the trees
he saw, far, far away, the bronzed hosts of a nation calling,—calling
faintly, calling loudly. he heard the hateful clank of their chains; he
felt them cringe and grovel, and there rose within him a [[protest]] and a
prophecy. and he girded himself to walk down the [[world]].

a voice and vision called him to be a [[priest]],—a seer to lead the
uncalled out of the house of bondage. he saw the headless host turn
toward him like the whirling of mad waters,—he stretched forth his
hands eagerly, and then, even as he stretched them, suddenly there
swept across the vision the temptation of despair.

they were not wicked [[men]],—the problem of [[life]] is not the problem of the
wicked,—they were calm, [[good]] [[men]], bishops of the apostolic [[church]] of
god, and strove toward [[righteousness]]. they said slowly, “it is all very
natural—it is even commendable; but the general theological seminary of
the episcopal [[church]] cannot admit a negro.” and when that thin,
half-grotesque figure still haunted their doors, they put their hands
kindly, half sorrowfully, on his shoulders, and said, “now,—of course,
we—we [[know]] how _you_ [[feel]] about it; but you see it is impossible,—that
is—well—it is premature. sometime, we trust—sincerely trust—all such
distinctions will fade away; but now the [[world]] is as it is.”

this was the temptation of despair; and the [[young]] [[man]] fought it
doggedly. like some grave shadow he flitted by those halls, pleading,
arguing, half angrily demanding admittance, until there came the final
_no;_ until [[men]] hustled the disturber away, marked him as foolish,
unreasonable, and injudicious, a [[vain]] rebel against [[god’s]] [[law]]. and then
from that vision splendid all the [[glory]] faded slowly away, and left an
earth gray and stern rolling on beneath a dark despair. even the kind
hands that stretched themselves toward him from out the depths of that
dull morning seemed but parts of the purple shadows. he saw them
coldly, and [[asked]], “why should i strive by special grace when the way
of the [[world]] is closed to me?” all gently yet, the hands urged him
on,—the hands of [[young]] john jay, that daring father’s daring [[son]]; the
hands of the [[good]] folk of boston, that [[free]] [[city]]. and yet, with a way
to the priesthood of the [[church]] open at [[last]] before him, the cloud
lingered there; and even when in old st. paul’s the venerable bishop
raised his [[white]] arms above the negro deacon—even then the burden had
not lifted from that [[heart]], for there had passed a [[glory]] from the
earth.

and yet the [[fire]] through which alexander crummell went did not burn in
vain. slowly and more soberly he took up again his plan of [[life]]. more
critically he [[studied]] the situation. deep down below the [[slavery]] and
servitude of the negro [[people]] he saw their fatal weaknesses, which long
years of mistreatment had emphasized. the dearth of [[strong]] moral
character, of unbending [[righteousness]], he [[felt]], was their great
shortcoming, and here he would begin. he would gather the [[best]] of his
people into some little episcopal chapel and there lead, [[teach]], and
inspire them, till the leaven spread, till the [[children]] grew, till the
world hearkened, till—till—and then across his [[dream]] gleamed some faint
after-glow of that first [[fair]] vision of youth—only an after-glow, for
there had passed a [[glory]] from the [[earth]].

one day—it was in 1842, and the springtide was struggling merrily with
the may winds of new england—he stood at [[last]] in his own chapel in
providence, a [[priest]] of the [[church]]. the days sped by, and the dark
young clergyman labored; he wrote his sermons carefully; he intoned his
prayers with a soft, earnest voice; he haunted the streets and accosted
the wayfarers; he visited the sick, and knelt beside the dying. he
worked and toiled, week by week, day by day, month by month. and yet
month by month the congregation dwindled, week by week the hollow walls
echoed more sharply, day by day the calls came fewer and fewer, and day
by day the third temptation sat clearer and still more clearly within
the veil; a temptation, as it were, bland and smiling, with just a
shade of mockery in its smooth tones. first it came casually, in the
cadence of a voice: “oh, colored folks? yes.” or perhaps more
definitely: “what do you _expect?_” in voice and gesture lay the
doubt—the temptation of [[doubt]]. how he hated it, and stormed at it
furiously! “of course they are capable,” he cried; “of course they can
learn and strive and achieve—” and “of course,” added the temptation
softly, “they do nothing of the sort.” of all the three temptations,
this one struck the deepest. hate? he had outgrown so childish a thing.
despair? he had steeled his [[right]] arm against it, and fought it with
the vigor of determination. but to [[doubt]] the worth of his life-work,—to
doubt the [[destiny]] and capability of the [[race]] his [[soul]] loved because it
was his; to find listless squalor instead of eager endeavor; to hear
his own lips whispering, “they do not [[care]]; they cannot [[know]]; they are
dumb driven cattle,—why cast your pearls before swine?”—this, this
seemed more than [[man]] could bear; and he closed the door, and sank upon
the steps of the chancel, and cast his robe upon the floor and writhed.

the evening sunbeams had set the dust to dancing in the gloomy chapel
when he arose. he folded his vestments, put away the hymn-books, and
closed the [[great]] bible. he stepped out into the twilight, looked back
upon the narrow little pulpit with a weary smile, and locked the door.
then he walked briskly to the bishop, and told the bishop what the
bishop already knew. “i have failed,” he said simply. and gaining
courage by the [[confession]], he added: “what i need is a larger
constituency. there are comparatively few negroes here, and perhaps
they are not of the [[best]]. i must go where the field is wider, and try
again.” so the bishop sent him to philadelphia, with a letter to bishop
onderdonk.

bishop onderdonk lived at the head of six [[white]] steps,—corpulent,
red-faced, and the author of several thrilling tracts on apostolic
succession. it was after dinner, and the bishop had settled himself for
a pleasant season of contemplation, when the bell must needs ring, and
there must burst in upon the bishop a letter and a thin, ungainly
negro. bishop onderdonk [[read]] the letter hastily and frowned.
fortunately, his [[mind]] was already clear on this point; and he cleared
his brow and looked at crummell. then he said, slowly and impressively:
“i will receive you into this diocese on one condition: no negro priest
can sit in my [[church]] convention, and no negro [[church]] must ask for
representation there.”

i sometimes fancy i can see that tableau: the frail black figure,
nervously twitching his hat before the massive abdomen of bishop
onderdonk; his threadbare coat thrown against the dark woodwork of the
bookcases, where fox’s “lives of the martyrs” nestled happily beside
“the whole [[duty]] of [[man]].” i seem to see the wide [[eyes]] of the negro
wander [[past]] the bishop’s broadcloth to where the swinging glass doors
of the cabinet glow in the sunlight. a little blue fly is trying to
cross the yawning keyhole. he marches briskly up to it, peers into the
chasm in a surprised sort of way, and rubs his feelers reflectively;
then he essays its depths, and, finding it bottomless, draws back
again. the dark-faced [[priest]] finds himself wondering if the fly too has
faced its valley of humiliation, and if it will plunge into it,—when
lo! it spreads its tiny wings and buzzes merrily across, leaving the
watcher wingless and alone.

then the full weight of his burden fell upon him. the [[rich]] walls
wheeled away, and before him lay the cold rough moor winding on through
life, cut in twain by one thick granite ridge,—here, the valley of
humiliation; yonder, the valley of the shadow of [[death]]. and i [[know]] not
which be darker,—no, not i. but this i [[know]]: in yonder vale of the
humble stand to-day a million swarthy [[men]], who willingly would

“. . . bear the whips and scorns of [[time]],
the oppressor’s [[wrong]], the proud man’s contumely,
the pangs of despised [[love]], the law’s delay,
the insolence of office, and the spurns
that patient [[merit]] of the unworthy takes,”—


all this and more would they bear did they but [[know]] that this were
sacrifice and not a meaner thing. so surged the [[thought]] within that
lone black breast. the bishop cleared his throat suggestively; then,
recollecting that there was really nothing to say, considerately said
nothing, only sat tapping his foot impatiently. but alexander crummell
said, slowly and heavily: “i will never enter your diocese on such
terms.” and saying this, he turned and passed into the valley of the
shadow of [[death]]. you might have noted only the physical dying, the
shattered frame and hacking cough; but in that [[soul]] lay deeper death
than that. he found a chapel in new york,—the [[church]] of his [[father]]; he
labored for it in [[poverty]] and starvation, scorned by his fellow
priests. half in despair, he wandered across the sea, a beggar with
outstretched hands. englishmen clasped them,—wilberforce and stanley,
thirwell and ingles, and even froude and macaulay; sir benjamin brodie
bade him rest awhile at queen’s college in cambridge, and there he
lingered, struggling for health of [[body]] and [[mind]], until he took his
degree in ’53. restless still, and unsatisfied, he turned toward
africa, and for long years, amid the spawn of the slave-smugglers,
sought a new [[heaven]] and a new [[earth]].

so the [[man]] groped for [[light]]; all this was not [[life]],—it was the
world-wandering of a [[soul]] in search of itself, the striving of one who
vainly sought his place in the [[world]], ever haunted by the shadow of a
death that is more than [[death]],—the passing of a [[soul]] that has missed
its [[duty]]. twenty years he wandered,—twenty years and more; and yet the
hard rasping [[question]] kept gnawing within him, “what, in [[god’s]] name, am
i on [[earth]] for?” in the narrow new york parish his [[soul]] seemed cramped
and smothered. in the fine old air of the english [[university]] he heard
the millions wailing over the sea. in the wild fever-cursed swamps of
west [[africa]] he stood helpless and alone.

you will not wonder at his weird pilgrimage,—you who in the swift whirl
of living, amid its cold paradox and marvellous vision, have fronted
life and [[asked]] its riddle face to face. and if you find that riddle
hard to [[read]], [[remember]] that yonder black boy finds it just a little
harder; if it is difficult for you to find and face your [[duty]], it is a
shade more difficult for him; if your [[heart]] sickens in the [[blood]] and
dust of [[battle]], [[remember]] that to him the dust is thicker and the battle
fiercer. no wonder the wanderers fall! no wonder we point to thief and
murderer, and haunting prostitute, and the never-ending throng of
unhearsed dead! the valley of the shadow of [[death]] gives few of its
pilgrims back to the [[world]].

but alexander crummell it gave back. out of the temptation of hate, and
burned by the [[fire]] of despair, triumphant over [[doubt]], and steeled by
sacrifice against humiliation, he turned at [[last]] [[home]] across the
waters, humble and [[strong]], gentle and determined. he bent to all the
gibes and prejudices, to all [[hatred]] and discrimination, with that rare
courtesy which is the armor of pure souls [[soul]]. he fought among his own, the
low, the grasping, and the wicked, with that unbending righteousness
which is the [[sword]] of the just. he never faltered, he seldom
complained; he simply worked, inspiring the [[young]], rebuking the old,
helping the [[weak]], guiding the [[strong]].

so he grew, and brought within his wide influence all that was [[best]] of
those who walk within the veil. they who [[live]] without knew not nor
dreamed of that full [[power]] within, that mighty inspiration which the
dull gauze of caste decreed that most [[men]] should not [[know]]. and now that
he is gone, i sweep the veil away and cry, lo! the [[soul]] to whose dear
memory i bring this little tribute. i can see his face still, dark and
heavy-lined beneath his snowy hair; lighting and shading, now with
inspiration for the future, now in [[innocent]] [[pain]] at some human
wickedness, now with [[sorrow]] at some hard memory from the [[past]]. the more
i met alexander crummell, the more i [[felt]] how much that [[world]] was
losing which knew so little of him. in another [[age]] he might have sat
among the elders of the [[land]] in purple-bordered toga; in another
country mothers [[mother]] might have sung him to the cradles.

he did his [[work]],—he did it nobly and well; and yet i [[sorrow]] that here
he worked alone, with so little [[human]] sympathy. his name to-day, in
this broad [[land]], means little, and comes to fifty million ears laden
with no incense of memory or emulation. and herein lies [[lie]] the tragedy of
the [[age]]: not that [[men]] are [[poor]],—all [[men]] [[know]] something of [[poverty]]; not
that [[men]] are wicked,—who is [[good]]? not that [[men]] are ignorant,—what is
truth? nay, but that [[men]] [[know]] so little of [[men]].

he sat one morning gazing toward the sea. he smiled and said, “the gate
is rusty on the hinges.” that night at starrise a wind came moaning out
of the west to blow the gate ajar, and then the [[soul]] i loved fled like
a flame across the seas, and in its seat sat [[death]].

i wonder where he is to-day? i wonder if in that dim [[world]] beyond, as
he came gliding in, there rose on some wan [[throne]] a [[king]],—a dark and
pierced jew, who knows [[know]] the writhings of the earthly damned, saying, as
he laid those heart-wrung [[talents]] down, “well done!” while round about
the morning stars sat singing.




xiii.
of the coming of john

what bring they ’neath the midnight,
    beside the river-sea?
they bring the [[human]] [[heart]] wherein
    no nightly calm can be;
that droppeth never with the wind,
    nor drieth with the dew;
o calm it, [[god]]; thy calm is broad
    to cover spirits too.
        the river floweth on.

mrs. browning.

carlisle street runs westward from the centre of johnstown, across a
great black bridge, down a hill and up again, by little shops and
meat-markets, [[past]] single-storied homes [[home]], until suddenly it stops
against a wide green lawn. it is a broad, restful place, with two large
buildings outlined against the west. when at evening the winds come
swelling from the east, and the [[great]] pall of the city’s smoke hangs
wearily above the valley, then the red west glows like a dreamland down
carlisle street, and, at the tolling of the supper-bell, throws the
passing forms of students in dark silhouette against the [[sky]]. tall and
black, they move slowly by, and seem in the sinister [[light]] to flit
before the [[city]] like dim warning ghosts. perhaps they are; for this is
wells institute, and these black students have few dealings with the
white [[city]] below.

and if you will notice, night after night, there is one dark form that
ever hurries [[last]] and late toward the twinkling lights [[light]] of swain
hall,—for jones is never on [[time]]. a long, straggling fellow he is,
brown and hard-haired, who seems to be growing straight out of his
clothes, and walks with a half-apologetic roll. he used perpetually to
set the quiet dining-room into waves of merriment, as he stole to his
place after the bell had tapped for prayers; he seemed so perfectly
awkward. and yet one glance at his face made one [[forgive]] him much,—that
broad, good-natured smile in which lay no bit of art [[arts]] or artifice, but
seemed just bubbling good-nature and [[genuine]] satisfaction with the
world.

he came to us from altamaha, away down there beneath the gnarled oaks
of southeastern georgia, where the sea croons to the sands and the
sands listen till they sink half drowned beneath the waters, rising
only here and there in long, low islands. the [[white]] folk of altamaha
voted john a [[good]] boy,—fine plough-hand, [[good]] in the rice-fields, handy
everywhere, and always good-natured and respectful. but they shook
their heads when his [[mother]] wanted to send him off to school. “it’ll
spoil him,—ruin him,” they said; and they talked as though they knew.
but full half the black folk followed him proudly to the station, and
carried his queer little trunk and many bundles. and there they shook
and shook hands, and the girls kissed him shyly and the boys clapped
him on the back. so the train came, and he pinched his little sister
lovingly, and put his [[great]] arms about his mother’s neck, and then was
away with a puff and a roar into the [[great]] yellow [[world]] that flamed and
flared about the doubtful pilgrim. up the coast they hurried, [[past]] the
squares and palmettos of savannah, through the cotton-fields and
through the weary night, to millville, and came with the morning to the
noise and bustle of johnstown.

and they that stood behind, that morning in altamaha, and watched the
train as it noisily bore playmate and [[brother]] and [[son]] away to the
world, had thereafter one ever-recurring word,—“when john comes.” then
what parties were to be, and what speakings in the churches [[church]]; what new
furniture in the front room,—perhaps even a new front room; and there
would be a new schoolhouse, with john as teacher; and then perhaps a
big wedding; all this and more—when john comes. but the [[white]] people
shook their heads.

at first he was coming at christmas-time,—but the vacation proved too
short; and then, the next summer,—but times [[time]] were hard and schooling
costly, and so, instead, he worked in johnstown. and so it drifted to
the next summer, and the next,—till playmates scattered, and mother
grew gray, and sister went up to the judge’s kitchen to [[work]]. and still
the legend lingered,—‘when john comes.”

up at the judge’s they rather liked this refrain; for they too had a
john—a fair-haired, smooth-faced boy, who had played many a long
summer’s day to its close with his darker namesake. “yes, sir! john is
at princeton, sir,” said the broad-shouldered gray-haired [[judge]] every
morning as he marched down to the post-office. “showing the yankees
what a southern gentleman can do,” he added; and strode [[home]] again with
his letters and papers. up at the [[great]] pillared house they lingered
long over the princeton letter,—the [[judge]] and his frail [[wife]], his
sister and growing daughters [[daughter]]. “it’ll make a [[man]] of him,” said the
judge, “college is the place.” and then he [[asked]] the shy little
waitress, “well, jennie, how’s your john?” and added reflectively, “too
bad, too [[bad]] your [[mother]] sent him off—it will spoil him.” and the
waitress wondered.

thus in the far-away southern village the [[world]] lay waiting, half
consciously, the coming of two [[young]] [[men]], and dreamed in an
inarticulate way of new things that would be done and new thoughts [[thought]] that
all would [[think]]. and yet it was singular that few [[thought]] of two
johns,—for the black folk [[thought]] of one john, and he was black; and
the [[white]] folk [[thought]] of another john, and he was [[white]]. and neither
world [[thought]] the other world’s [[thought]], save with a vague unrest.

up in johnstown, at the institute, we were long puzzled at the case of
john jones. for a long [[time]] the clay seemed unfit for any sort of
moulding. he was loud and boisterous, always laughing and singing, and
never able to [[work]] consecutively at anything. he did not [[know]] how to
study; he had no [[idea]] of thoroughness; and with his tardiness,
carelessness, and appalling good-humor, we were sore perplexed. one
night we sat in faculty-meeting, worried and serious; for jones was in
trouble again. this [[last]] escapade was too much, and so we solemnly
voted “that jones, on account of repeated disorder and inattention to
work, be suspended for the rest of the term.”

it seemed to us that the first [[time]] [[life]] ever struck jones as a really
serious thing was when the dean told him he must leave school. he
stared at the gray-haired [[man]] blankly, with [[great]] [[eyes]]. “why,—why,” he
faltered, “but—i haven’t graduated!” then the dean slowly and clearly
explained, reminding him of the tardiness and the carelessness, of the
poor lessons and neglected [[work]], of the noise and disorder, until the
fellow hung his head in confusion. then he said quickly, “but you won’t
tell mammy and sister,—you won’t write mammy, now will you? for if you
won’t i’ll go out into the [[city]] and [[work]], and come back next term and
show you something.” so the dean promised faithfully, and john
shouldered his little trunk, giving neither word nor look to the
giggling boys, and walked down carlisle street to the [[great]] [[city]], with
sober [[eyes]] and a set and serious face.

perhaps we imagined it, but someway it seemed to us that the serious
look that crept over his boyish face that afternoon never left it
again. when he came back to us he went to [[work]] with all his rugged
strength. it was a hard struggle, for things did not come easily to
him,—few crowding memories of early [[life]] and teaching came to [[help]] him
on his new way; but all the [[world]] toward which he strove was of his own
building, and he builded slow and hard. as the [[light]] dawned lingeringly
on his new creations, he sat rapt and silent before the vision, or
wandered alone over the green campus peering through and beyond the
world of [[men]] into a [[world]] of [[thought]]. and the thoughts [[thought]] at times [[time]] puzzled
him sorely; he could not see just why the circle was not square, and
carried it out fifty-six decimal places one midnight,—would have gone
further, indeed, had not the matron rapped for lights [[light]] out. he caught
terrible colds lying on his back in the meadows of nights, trying to
think out the solar [[system]]; he had grave doubts [[doubt]] as to the ethics of the
fall of [[rome]], and strongly suspected the germans of being thieves and
rascals, despite his textbooks; he pondered long over every new greek
word, and wondered why this meant that and why it couldn’t mean
something else, and how it must have [[felt]] to [[think]] all things in [[greek]].
so he [[thought]] and puzzled along for himself,—pausing perplexed where
others skipped merrily, and walking steadily through the difficulties
where the rest stopped and surrendered.

thus he grew in [[body]] and [[soul]], and with him his clothes seemed to grow
and arrange themselves; coat sleeves got longer, cuffs appeared, and
collars got less soiled. now and then his boots shone, and a new
dignity crept into his walk. and we who saw daily a new thoughtfulness
growing in his [[eyes]] began to expect something of this plodding boy.
thus he passed out of the preparatory school into college, and we who
watched him [[felt]] four more years of [[change]], which almost transformed
the tall, grave [[man]] who bowed to us commencement morning. he had left
his queer thought-world and come back to a [[world]] of motion and of [[men]].
he looked now for the first [[time]] sharply about him, and wondered he had
seen so little before. he grew slowly to [[feel]] almost for the first time
the veil that lay between him and the [[white]] [[world]]; he first noticed now
the oppression that had not seemed oppression before, differences that
erstwhile seemed [[natural]], restraints and slights that in his boyhood
days had gone unnoticed or been greeted with a laugh. he [[felt]] angry now
when [[men]] did not call him “mister,” he clenched his hands at the “jim
crow” cars, and chafed at the color-line that hemmed in him and his. a
tinge of sarcasm crept into his [[speech]], and a vague bitterness into his
life; and he sat long hours wondering and planning a way around these
crooked things. daily he found himself shrinking from the choked and
narrow [[life]] of his native town. and yet he always planned to go back to
altamaha,—always planned to [[work]] there. still, more and more as the day
approached he hesitated with a nameless dread; and even the day after
graduation he seized with eagerness the offer of the dean to send him
north with the quartette during the summer vacation, to sing for the
institute. a breath of air before the plunge, he said to himself in
half apology.

it was a bright september afternoon, and the streets of new york were
brilliant with moving [[men]]. they reminded john of the sea, as he sat in
the square and watched them, so changelessly changing, so bright and
dark, so grave and [[gay]]. he scanned their [[rich]] and faultless clothes,
the way they carried their hands, the shape of their hats; he peered
into the hurrying carriages. then, leaning back with a sigh, he said,
“this is the [[world]].” the notion suddenly seized him to see where the
world was going; since many of the richer and brighter seemed hurrying
all one way. so when a tall, light-haired [[young]] [[man]] and a little
talkative [[lady]] came by, he rose half hesitatingly and followed them. up
the street they went, [[past]] stores and [[gay]] shops, across a broad square,
until with a hundred others they entered the high portal of a great
building.

he was pushed toward the ticket-office with the others, and [[felt]] in his
pocket for the new five-dollar bill he had hoarded. there seemed really
no [[time]] for hesitation, so he drew it bravely out, passed it to the
busy clerk, and received simply a ticket but no [[change]]. when at [[last]] he
realized that he had paid five dollars to enter he knew not what, he
stood stockstill amazed. “be careful,” said a low voice behind him;
“you must not lynch the colored gentleman simply because he’s in your
way,” and a girl looked up roguishly into the [[eyes]] of her fair-haired
escort. a shade of annoyance passed over the escort’s face. “you _will_
not [[understand]] us at the south,” he said half impatiently, as if
continuing an argument. “with all your professions, one never sees in
the north so cordial and intimate relations between [[white]] and black as
are everyday occurrences with us. why, i [[remember]] my closest playfellow
in boyhood was a little negro named after me, and surely no
two,—_well_!” the [[man]] stopped short and flushed to the roots of his
hair, for there directly beside his reserved orchestra chairs sat the
negro he had stumbled over in the hallway. he hesitated and grew pale
with anger, called the usher and gave him his card, with a few
peremptory words, and slowly sat down. the [[lady]] deftly changed the
subject.

all this john did not see, for he sat in a half-daze minding the scene
about him; the delicate [[beauty]] of the hall, the faint perfume, the
moving myriad of [[men]], the [[rich]] clothing and low hum of talking seemed
all a part of a [[world]] so different from his, so strangely more
beautiful than anything he had known, that he sat in dreamland, and
started when, after a hush, rose high and clear the [[music]] of
lohengrin’s swan. the infinite [[beauty]] of the wail lingered and swept
through every muscle of his frame, and put it all a-tune. he closed his
eyes and grasped the elbows of the chair, touching unwittingly the
lady’s arm. and the [[lady]] drew away. a deep longing swelled in all his
heart to rise with that clear [[music]] out of the dirt and dust of that
low [[life]] that held him prisoned and befouled. if he could only [[live]] up
in the [[free]] air where birds sang and setting suns had no touch of
blood! who had called him to be the [[slave]] and butt of all? and if he
had called, what [[right]] had he to call when a [[world]] like this lay open
before [[men]]?

then the movement changed, and fuller, mightier harmony swelled away.
he looked thoughtfully across the hall, and wondered why the beautiful
gray-haired woman looked so listless, and what the little [[man]] could be
whispering about. he would not like to be listless and idle, he
thought, for he [[felt]] with the [[music]] the movement of [[power]] within him.
if he but had some master-work, some life-service, hard,—aye, bitter
hard, but without the cringing and sickening servility, without the
cruel hurt that hardened his [[heart]] and [[soul]]. when at [[last]] a soft sorrow
crept across the violins, there came to him the vision of a far-off
home, the [[great]] [[eyes]] of his sister, and the dark drawn face of his
mother. and his [[heart]] sank below the waters, even as the sea-sand sinks
by the shores of altamaha, only to be lifted aloft again with that last
ethereal wail of the swan that quivered and faded away into the [[sky]].

it left john sitting so silent and rapt that he did not for some time
notice the usher tapping him lightly on the shoulder and saying
politely, “will you step this way, please, sir?” a little surprised, he
arose quickly at the [[last]] tap, and, turning to leave his seat, looked
full into the face of the fair-haired [[young]] [[man]]. for the first [[time]] the
young [[man]] recognized his dark boyhood playmate, and john knew that it
was the judge’s [[son]]. the [[white]] john started, lifted his hand, and then
froze into his chair; the black john smiled lightly, then grimly, and
followed the usher down the aisle. the manager was [[sorry]], very, very
sorry,—but he explained that some mistake had been made in selling the
gentleman a seat already disposed of; he would refund the [[money]], of
course,—and indeed [[felt]] the matter keenly, and so forth, and—before he
had finished john was gone, walking hurriedly across the square and
down the broad streets, and as he passed the park he buttoned his coat
and said, “john jones, you’re a natural-born [[fool]].” then he went to his
lodgings and wrote a letter, and tore it up; he wrote another, and
threw it in the [[fire]]. then he seized a scrap of paper and wrote: “dear
mother and sister—i am coming—john.”

“perhaps,” said john, as he settled himself on the train, “perhaps i am
to blame myself in struggling against my manifest [[destiny]] simply
because it looks hard and unpleasant. here is my [[duty]] to altamaha plain
before me; perhaps they’ll let me [[help]] settle the negro problems
there,—perhaps they won’t. ‘i will go in to the [[king]], which is not
according to the [[law]]; and if i perish, i perish.’” and then he mused
and dreamed, and planned a life-work; and the train flew south.

down in altamaha, after seven long years, all the [[world]] knew john was
coming. the homes [[home]] were scrubbed and scoured,—above all, one; the
gardens and yards had an unwonted trimness, and jennie bought a new
gingham. with some finesse and negotiation, all the dark methodists and
presbyterians were induced to join in a monster welcome at the baptist
church; and as the day drew near, warm discussions arose on every
corner as to the exact extent and [[nature]] of john’s accomplishments. it
was noontide on a gray and cloudy day when he came. the black town
flocked to the depot, with a little of the [[white]] at the edges,—a happy
throng, with “good-mawnings” and “howdys” and laughing and joking and
jostling. [[mother]] sat yonder in the window watching; but sister jennie
stood on the platform, nervously fingering her dress, tall and lithe,
with soft brown skin and loving [[eyes]] peering from out a tangled
wilderness of hair. john rose gloomily as the train stopped, for he was
thinking of the “jim crow” car; he stepped to the platform, and paused:
a little dingy station, a black crowd gaudy and dirty, a half-mile of
dilapidated shanties along a straggling ditch of mud. an overwhelming
sense of the sordidness and narrowness of it all seized him; he looked
in [[vain]] for his [[mother]], kissed coldly the tall, [[strange]] girl who called
him [[brother]], spoke a short, dry word here and there; then, lingering
neither for handshaking nor gossip, started silently up the street,
raising his hat merely to the [[last]] eager old aunty, to her open-mouthed
astonishment. the [[people]] were distinctly bewildered. this silent, cold
man,—was this john? where was his smile and hearty hand-grasp? “’peared
kind o’ down in the mouf,” said the methodist preacher thoughtfully.
“seemed monstus stuck up,” complained a baptist sister. but the white
postmaster from the edge of the crowd expressed the [[opinion]] of his
folks plainly. “that damn nigger,” said he, as he shouldered the mail
and arranged his tobacco, “has gone north and got plum full o’ fool
notions; but they won’t [[work]] in altamaha.” and the crowd melted away.

the meeting of welcome at the baptist [[church]] was a failure. rain
spoiled the barbecue, and thunder turned the milk in the ice-cream.
when the speaking came at night, the house was crowded to overflowing.
the three preachers had especially prepared themselves, but somehow
john’s manner seemed to throw a blanket over everything,—he seemed so
cold and preoccupied, and had so [[strange]] an air of restraint that the
methodist [[brother]] could not warm up to his theme and elicited not a
single “amen’; the presbyterian prayer was but feebly responded to, and
even the baptist preacher, though he wakened faint enthusiasm, got so
mixed up in his favorite sentence that he had to close it by stopping
fully fifteen minutes sooner than he meant. the [[people]] moved uneasily
in their seats as john rose to reply. he spoke slowly and methodically.
the [[age]], he said, demanded new ideas [[idea]]; we were far different from those
men of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,—with broader ideas [[idea]] of
human brotherhood and [[destiny]]. then he spoke of the rise of charity and
popular [[education]], and particularly of the spread of [[wealth]] and [[work]].
the [[question]] was, then, he added reflectively, looking at the low
discolored ceiling, what part the negroes of this [[land]] would take in
the striving of the new century. he sketched in vague outline the new
industrial school that might rise among these pines, he spoke in detail
of the charitable and philanthropic [[work]] that might be organized, of
money that might be saved for banks and [[business]]. finally he urged
unity, and deprecated especially [[religious]] and denominational
bickering. “to-day,” he said, with a smile, “the [[world]] cares [[care]] little
whether a [[man]] be baptist or methodist, or indeed a churchman at all, so
long as he is [[good]] and true. what difference does it make whether a man
be baptized in river or washbowl, or not at all? let’s leave all that
littleness, and look higher.” then, thinking of nothing else, he slowly
sat down. a painful hush seized that crowded mass. little had they
understood of what he said, for he spoke an unknown tongue, save the
last word about baptism; that they knew, and they sat very still while
the clock ticked. then at [[last]] a low suppressed snarl came from the
amen corner, and an old bent [[man]] arose, walked over the seats, and
climbed straight up into the pulpit. he was wrinkled and black, with
scant gray and tufted hair; his voice and hands shook as with palsy;
but on his face lay the intense rapt look of the [[religious]] fanatic. he
seized the bible with his rough, huge hands; twice he raised it
inarticulate, and then fairly burst into words, with rude and awful
eloquence. he quivered, swayed, and bent; then rose aloft in perfect
majesty, till the [[people]] moaned and wept, wailed and shouted, and a
wild shrieking arose from the corners where all the pent-up feeling of
the hour gathered itself and rushed into the air. john never knew
clearly what the old [[man]] said; he only [[felt]] himself held up to scorn
and scathing denunciation for trampling on the true [[religion]], and he
realized with amazement that all unknowingly he had put rough, rude
hands on something this little [[world]] held [[sacred]]. he arose silently,
and passed out into the night. down toward the sea he went, in the
fitful starlight, half conscious of the girl who followed timidly after
him. when at [[last]] he stood upon the bluff, he turned to his little
sister and looked upon her sorrowfully, remembering with sudden pain
how little [[thought]] he had given her. he put his arm about her and let
her passion of tears spend itself on his shoulder.

long they stood together, peering over the gray unresting water.

“john,” she said, “does it make every one—unhappy when they study and
learn lots of things?”

he paused and smiled. “i am afraid it does,” he said.

“and, john, are you glad you [[studied]]?”

“yes,” came the [[answer]], slowly but positively.

she watched the flickering lights [[light]] upon the sea, and said thoughtfully,
“i [[wish]] i was unhappy,—and—and,” putting both arms about his neck, “i
think i am, a little, john.”

it was several days later that john walked up to the judge’s house to
ask for the [[privilege]] of teaching the negro school. the [[judge]] himself
met him at the front door, stared a little hard at him, and said
brusquely, “go ’round to the kitchen door, john, and wait.” sitting on
the kitchen steps, john stared at the corn, thoroughly perplexed. what
on [[earth]] had come over him? every step he made offended some one. he
had come to save his [[people]], and before he left the depot he had hurt
them. he sought to [[teach]] them at the [[church]], and had outraged their
deepest feelings. he had schooled himself to be respectful to the
judge, and then blundered into his front door. and all the [[time]] he had
meant [[right]],—and yet, and yet, somehow he found it so hard and strange
to fit his old surroundings again, to find his place in the [[world]] about
him. he could not [[remember]] that he used to have any difficulty in the
past, when [[life]] was glad and [[gay]]. the [[world]] seemed smooth and easy
then. perhaps,—but his sister came to the kitchen door just then and
said the [[judge]] awaited him.

the [[judge]] sat in the dining-room amid his morning’s mail, and he did
not ask john to sit down. he plunged squarely into the [[business]].
“you’ve come for the school, i suppose. well john, i want to speak to
you plainly. you [[know]] i’m a friend to your [[people]]. i’ve helped you and
your [[family]], and would have done more if you hadn’t got the notion of
going off. now i like the colored [[people]], and sympathize with all their
reasonable aspirations; but you and i both [[know]], john, that in this
country the negro must remain subordinate, and can never expect to be
the [[equal]] of [[white]] [[men]]. in their place, your [[people]] can be honest and
respectful; and [[god]] knows [[know]], i’ll do what i can to [[help]] them. but when
they want to reverse [[nature]], and [[rule]] [[white]] [[men]], and [[marry]] [[white]] [[women]],
and sit in my parlor, then, by god! we’ll hold them under if we have to
lynch every nigger in the [[land]]. now, john, the [[question]] is, are you,
with your [[education]] and northern notions, going to accept the situation
and [[teach]] the darkies to be faithful servants and laborers as your
fathers were,—i knew your [[father]], john, he belonged to my [[brother]], and
he was a [[good]] nigger. well—well, are you going to be like him, or are
you going to try to put [[fool]] ideas [[idea]] of rising and equality into these
folks’ heads, and make them discontented and unhappy?”

“i am going to accept the situation, [[judge]] henderson,” answered john,
with a brevity that did not escape the keen old [[man]]. he hesitated a
moment, and then said shortly, “very well,—we’ll try you awhile.
good-morning.”

it was a full month after the opening of the negro school that the
other john came [[home]], tall, [[gay]], and headstrong. the [[mother]] wept, the
sisters sang. the whole [[white]] town was glad. a proud [[man]] was the [[judge]],
and it was a goodly sight to see the two swinging down main street
together. and yet all did not go smoothly between them, for the younger
man could not and did not veil his contempt for the little town, and
plainly had his [[heart]] set on new york. now the one cherished ambition
of the [[judge]] was to see his [[son]] mayor of altamaha, representative to
the legislature, and—who could say?—governor of georgia. so the
argument often waxed hot between them. “good heavens [[heaven]], [[father]],” the
younger [[man]] would say after dinner, as he lighted a cigar and stood by
the fireplace, “you surely don’t expect a [[young]] fellow like me to
settle down permanently in this—this god-forgotten town with nothing
but mud and negroes?” “_i_ did,” the [[judge]] would [[answer]] laconically;
and on this particular day it seemed from the gathering scowl that he
was about to add something more emphatic, but neighbors had already
begun to drop in to [[admire]] his [[son]], and the conversation drifted.

“heah that john is livenin’ things up at the darky school,” volunteered
the postmaster, after a pause.

“what now?” [[asked]] the [[judge]], sharply.

“oh, nothin’ in particulah,—just his almighty air and uppish ways.
b’lieve i did heah somethin’ about his givin’ talks on the french
revolution, equality, and such like. he’s what i call a dangerous
nigger.”

“have you heard him say anything out of the way?”

“why, no,—but sally, our girl, told my [[wife]] a lot of rot. then, too, i
don’t need to heah: a nigger what won’t say ‘sir’ to a [[white]] [[man]], or—”

“who is this john?” interrupted the [[son]].

“why, it’s little black john, peggy’s [[son]],—your old playfellow.”

the [[young]] man’s face flushed angrily, and then he laughed.

“oh,” said he, “it’s the darky that tried to [[force]] himself into a seat
beside the [[lady]] i was escorting—”

but [[judge]] henderson waited to hear no more. he had been nettled all
day, and now at this he rose with a half-smothered oath, took his hat
and cane, and walked straight to the schoolhouse.

for john, it had been a long, hard pull to get things started in the
rickety old shanty that sheltered his school. the negroes were rent
into factions for and against him, the parents were careless, the
children irregular and dirty, and books [[book]], pencils, and slates largely
missing. nevertheless, he struggled hopefully on, and seemed to see at
last some glimmering of dawn. the attendance was larger and the
children were a shade cleaner this week. even the booby class in
reading showed a little comforting [[progress]]. so john settled himself
with renewed patience this afternoon.

“now, mandy,” he said cheerfully, “that’s [[better]]; but you mustn’t chop
your words up so: ‘if—the-man—goes.’ why, your little [[brother]] even
wouldn’t tell a story that way, now would he?”

“naw, suh, he cain’t talk.”

“all [[right]]; now let’s try again: ‘if the man—’

“john!”

the whole school started in surprise, and the teacher half arose, as
the red, angry face of the [[judge]] appeared in the open doorway.

“john, this school is closed. you [[children]] can go [[home]] and get to [[work]].
the [[white]] [[people]] of altamaha are not spending their [[money]] on black
folks to have their heads crammed with impudence and lies [[lie]]. clear out!
i’ll lock the door myself.”

up at the [[great]] pillared house the tall [[young]] [[son]] wandered aimlessly
about after his father’s abrupt departure. in the house there was
little to interest him; the books [[book]] were old and stale, the local
newspaper flat, and the [[women]] had retired with headaches and sewing. he
tried a nap, but it was too warm. so he sauntered out into the fields,
complaining disconsolately, “good lord! how long will this imprisonment
last!” he was not a [[bad]] fellow,—just a little spoiled and
self-indulgent, and as headstrong as his proud [[father]]. he seemed a
young [[man]] pleasant to look upon, as he sat on the [[great]] black stump at
the edge of the pines idly swinging his legs and smoking. “why, there
isn’t even a girl worth getting up a respectable flirtation with,” he
growled. just then his eye caught a tall, willowy figure hurrying
toward him on the narrow path. he looked with interest at first, and
then burst into a laugh as he said, “well, i declare, if it isn’t
jennie, the little brown kitchen-maid! why, i never noticed before what
a trim little [[body]] she is. hello, jennie! why, you haven’t kissed me
since i came [[home]],” he said gaily. the [[young]] girl stared at him in
surprise and confusion,—faltered something inarticulate, and attempted
to pass. but a wilful mood had seized the [[young]] idler, and he caught at
her arm. frightened, she slipped by; and half mischievously he turned
and ran after her through the tall pines.

yonder, toward the sea, at the end of the path, came john slowly, with
his head down. he had turned wearily homeward from the schoolhouse;
then, thinking to shield his [[mother]] from the blow, started to meet his
sister as she came from [[work]] and break the news of his dismissal to
her. “i’ll go away,” he said slowly; “i’ll go away and find [[work]], and
send for them. i cannot [[live]] here longer.” and then the fierce, buried
anger surged up into his throat. he waved his arms and hurried wildly
up the path.

the [[great]] brown sea lay silent. the air scarce breathed. the dying day
bathed the twisted oaks and mighty pines in black and gold. there came
from the wind no warning, not a whisper from the cloudless [[sky]]. there
was only a black [[man]] hurrying on with an ache in his [[heart]], seeing
neither sun nor sea, but starting as from a [[dream]] at the frightened cry
that woke the pines, to see his dark sister struggling in the arms of a
tall and fair-haired [[man]].

he said not a word, but, seizing a fallen limb, struck him with all the
pent-up [[hatred]] of his [[great]] black arm, and the [[body]] lay [[white]] and still
beneath the pines, all bathed in sunshine and in [[blood]]. john looked at
it dreamily, then walked back to the house briskly, and said in a soft
voice, “mammy, i’m going away—i’m going to be [[free]].”

she gazed at him dimly and faltered, “no’th, honey, is yo’ gwine no’th
agin?”

he looked out where the north star glistened pale above the waters, and
said, “yes, mammy, i’m going—north.”

then, without another word, he went out into the narrow lane, up by the
straight pines, to the same winding path, and seated himself on the
great black stump, looking at the [[blood]] where the [[body]] had lain. yonder
in the gray [[past]] he had played with that [[dead]] boy, romping together
under the solemn trees. the night deepened; he [[thought]] of the boys at
johnstown. he wondered how brown had turned out, and carey? and
jones,—jones? why, he was jones, and he wondered what they would all
say when they knew, when they knew, in that [[great]] long dining-room with
its hundreds of merry [[eyes]]. then as the sheen of the starlight stole
over him, he [[thought]] of the gilded ceiling of that vast concert hall,
heard stealing toward him the faint sweet [[music]] of the swan. hark! was
it [[music]], or the hurry and shouting of [[men]]? yes, surely! clear and high
the faint sweet melody rose and fluttered like a living thing, so that
the very [[earth]] trembled as with the tramp of horses and murmur of angry
men.

he leaned back and smiled toward the sea, whence rose the strange
melody, away from the dark shadows where lay the noise of horses
galloping, galloping on. with an effort he roused himself, bent
forward, and looked steadily down the pathway, softly humming the “song
of the bride,”—

“freudig geführt, ziehet dahin.”


amid the trees in the dim morning twilight he watched their shadows
dancing and heard their horses thundering toward him, until at last
they came sweeping like a storm, and he saw in front that haggard
white-haired [[man]], whose [[eyes]] flashed red with fury. oh, how he pitied
him,—pitied him,—and wondered if he had the coiling twisted rope. then,
as the storm burst round him, he rose slowly to his feet and turned his
closed [[eyes]] toward the sea.

and the [[world]] whistled in his ears.




xiv.
of the [[sorrow]] songs

i walk through the churchyard
    to lay this [[body]] down;
i [[know]] moon-rise, i [[know]] star-rise;
i walk in the moonlight, i walk in the starlight;
i’ll [[lie]] in the grave and stretch out my arms,
i’ll go to [[judgment]] in the evening of the day,
and my [[soul]] and thy [[soul]] shall meet that day,
    when i lay this [[body]] down.

negro [[song]].

[illustration]


they that walked in darkness sang songs [[song]] in the olden days—sorrow
songs—for they were weary at [[heart]]. and so before each [[thought]] that i
have written in this [[book]] i have set a phrase, a haunting echo of these
weird old songs [[song]] in which the [[soul]] of the black [[slave]] spoke to [[men]]. ever
since i was a child these songs [[song]] have stirred me strangely. they came
out of the south unknown to me, one by one, and yet at once i knew them
as of me and of mine. then in after years when i came to nashville i
saw the [[great]] temple builded of these songs [[song]] towering over the pale
city. to me jubilee hall seemed ever made of the songs [[song]] themselves, and
its bricks were red with the [[blood]] and dust of toil. out of them rose
for me morning, noon, and night, bursts of wonderful melody, full of
the voices of my brothers [[brother]] and sisters, full of the voices of the [[past]].

little of [[beauty]] has [[america]] given the [[world]] save the rude grandeur god
himself stamped on her bosom; the [[human]] spirit in this new [[world]] has
expressed itself in vigor and ingenuity rather than in [[beauty]]. and so
by fateful [[chance]] the negro folk-song—the rhythmic cry of the
slave—stands to-day not simply as the sole american [[music]], but as the
most beautiful expression of [[human]] [[experience]] born this side the seas.
it has been neglected, it has been, and is, half despised, and above
all it has been persistently mistaken and misunderstood; but
notwithstanding, it still remains as the singular [[spiritual]] heritage of
the nation and the [[greatest]] gift of the negro [[people]].

away back in the thirties the melody of these [[slave]] songs [[song]] stirred the
nation, but the songs [[song]] were soon half forgotten. some, like “near the
lake where drooped the willow,” passed into current airs and their
source was forgotten; others were caricatured on the “minstrel” stage
and their memory died away. then in war-time came the singular port
royal experiment after the capture of hilton head, and perhaps for the
first [[time]] the north met the southern [[slave]] face to face and [[heart]] to
heart with no third witness. the sea islands of the carolinas, where
they met, were filled with a black folk of primitive type, touched and
moulded less by the [[world]] about them than any others outside the black
belt. their appearance was uncouth, their [[language]] funny, but their
hearts were [[human]] and their singing stirred [[men]] with a mighty [[power]].
thomas wentworth higginson hastened to tell of these songs [[song]], and miss
mckim and others urged upon the [[world]] their rare [[beauty]]. but the world
listened only half credulously until the fisk jubilee singers sang the
slave songs [[song]] so deeply into the world’s [[heart]] that it can never wholly
forget them again.

there was once a blacksmith’s [[son]] born at cadiz, new york, who in the
changes of [[time]] taught school in ohio and helped defend cincinnati from
kirby smith. then he fought at chancellorsville and gettysburg and
finally served in the freedmen’s bureau at nashville. here he formed a
sunday-school class of black [[children]] in 1866, and sang with them and
taught them to sing. and then they taught him to sing, and when once
the [[glory]] of the jubilee songs [[song]] passed into the [[soul]] of george l. [[white]],
he knew his life-work was to let those negroes sing to the [[world]] as
they had sung to him. so in 1871 the pilgrimage of the fisk jubilee
singers began. north to cincinnati they rode,—four half-clothed black
boys and five girl-women,—led by a [[man]] with a cause and a [[purpose]]. they
stopped at wilberforce, the oldest of negro schools, where a black
bishop blessed them. then they went, fighting cold and starvation, shut
out of hotels, and cheerfully sneered at, ever northward; and ever the
magic of their [[song]] kept thrilling hearts [[heart]], until a burst of applause in
the congregational council at oberlin revealed them to the [[world]]. they
came to new york and henry ward beecher dared to welcome them, even
though the metropolitan dailies sneered at his “nigger minstrels.” so
their songs [[song]] conquered till they sang across the [[land]] and across the
sea, before queen and kaiser, in [[scotland]] and ireland, holland and
switzerland. seven years they sang, and brought back a hundred and
fifty thousand dollars to found fisk [[university]].

since their day they have been imitated—sometimes well, by the singers
of hampton and atlanta, sometimes ill, by straggling quartettes.
caricature has sought again to spoil the quaint [[beauty]] of the [[music]],
and has filled the air with many debased melodies which vulgar ears
scarce [[know]] from the real. but the true negro folk-song still lives [[life]] in
the hearts [[heart]] of those who have heard them truly sung and in the hearts [[heart]] of
the negro [[people]].

what are these songs [[song]], and what do they mean? i [[know]] little of [[music]] and
can say nothing in technical phrase, but i [[know]] something of [[men]], and
knowing them, i [[know]] that these songs [[song]] are the articulate message of the
slave to the [[world]]. they tell us in these eager days that [[life]] was
joyous to the black [[slave]], careless and [[happy]]. i can easily believe
this of some, of many. but not all the [[past]] south, though it rose from
the [[dead]], can gainsay the heart-touching witness of these songs [[song]]. they
are the [[music]] of an unhappy [[people]], of the [[children]] of disappointment;
they tell of [[death]] and suffering and unvoiced longing toward a truer
world, of misty wanderings and hidden ways.

the songs [[song]] are indeed the siftings of centuries; the [[music]] is far more
ancient than the words, and in it we can trace here and there signs of
development. my grandfather’s grandmother was seized by an [[evil]] dutch
trader two centuries ago; and coming to the valleys of the hudson and
housatonic, black, little, and lithe, she shivered and shrank in the
harsh north winds, looked longingly at the hills, and often crooned a
heathen melody to the child between her knees, thus:

[illustration]

the child sang it to his [[children]] and they to their children’s
children, and so two hundred years it has travelled down to us and we
sing it to our [[children]], knowing as little as our fathers [[father]] what its
words may mean, but knowing well the meaning of its [[music]].

this was primitive african [[music]]; it may be seen in larger form in the
strange chant which heralds “the coming of john’:

“you may bury me in the east,
you may bury me in the west,
but i’ll hear the trumpet sound in that morning,”


—the voice of [[exile]].

ten master songs [[song]], more or less, one may pluck from the forest of
melody-songs of undoubted negro origin and wide popular currency, and
songs peculiarly characteristic of the [[slave]]. one of these i have just
mentioned. another whose strains begin this [[book]] is “nobody knows [[know]] the
trouble i’ve seen.” when, struck with a sudden [[poverty]], the united
states refused to fulfill its promises of [[land]] to the freedmen, a
brigadier-general went down to the sea islands to carry the news. an
old woman on the outskirts of the throng began singing this [[song]]; all
the mass joined with her, swaying. and the soldier wept.

the third [[song]] is the cradle-song of [[death]] which all [[men]] [[know]],—‘swing
low, sweet chariot,”—whose bars begin the [[life]] story of “alexander
crummell.” then there is the [[song]] of many waters, “roll, jordan, roll,”
a mighty chorus with minor cadences. there were many songs [[song]] of the
fugitive like that which opens “the wings of atalanta,” and the more
familiar “been a-listening.” the seventh is the [[song]] of the end and the
beginning—“my [[lord]], what a mourning! when the stars begin to fall”; a
strain of this is placed before “the dawn of [[freedom]].” the [[song]] of
groping—“my way’s cloudy”—begins “the meaning of progress”; the ninth
is the [[song]] of this chapter—“wrestlin’ jacob, the day is a-breaking,”—a
paean of hopeful strife. the [[last]] master [[song]] is the [[song]] of
songs—“steal away,”—sprung from “the [[faith]] of the fathers [[father]].”

there are many others of the negro folk-songs as striking and
characteristic as these, as, for instance, the three strains in the
third, eighth, and ninth chapters [[chapter]]; and others i am sure could easily
make a selection on more scientific principles [[principle]]. there are, too, songs
that seem to be a step removed from the more primitive types: there is
the maze-like medley, “bright sparkles,” one phrase of which heads “the
black belt”; the easter carol, “dust, dust and ashes”; the dirge, “my
mother’s took her flight and gone home”; and that burst of melody
hovering over “the passing of the first-born”—“i [[hope]] my [[mother]] will be
there in that beautiful [[world]] on high.”

these represent a third step in the [[development]] of the [[slave]] [[song]], of
which “you may bury me in the east” is the first, and songs [[song]] like “march
on” (chapter six) and “steal away” are the second. the first is african
music, the second afro-american, while the third is a blending of negro
music with the [[music]] heard in the foster [[land]]. the result is still
distinctively negro and the method of blending original, but the
elements are both negro and caucasian. one might go further and find a
fourth step in this [[development]], where the songs [[song]] of [[white]] [[america]] have
been distinctively influenced by the [[slave]] songs [[song]] or have incorporated
whole phrases of negro melody, as “swanee river” and “old black joe.”
side by side, too, with the [[growth]] has gone the debasements and
imitations—the negro “minstrel” songs [[song]], many of the “gospel” hymns, and
some of the contemporary “coon” songs [[song]],—a mass of [[music]] in which the
novice may easily lose himself and never find the real negro melodies.

in these songs [[song]], i have said, the [[slave]] spoke to the [[world]]. such a
message is naturally veiled and half articulate. words and [[music]] have
lost each other and new and cant phrases of a dimly understood theology
have displaced the older sentiment. once in a while we catch a strange
word of an unknown tongue, as the “mighty myo,” which figures as a
river of [[death]]; more often slight words or mere doggerel are joined to
music of singular sweetness. purely secular songs [[song]] are few in number,
partly because many of them were turned into hymns by a [[change]] of
words, partly because the frolics were seldom heard by the stranger,
and the [[music]] less often caught. of nearly all the songs [[song]], however, the
music is distinctly sorrowful. the ten master songs [[song]] i have mentioned
tell in word and [[music]] of trouble and [[exile]], of strife and hiding; they
grope toward some unseen [[power]] and sigh for rest in the end.

the words that are left to us are not without interest, and, cleared of
evident dross, they conceal much of real poetry and meaning beneath
conventional theology and unmeaning rhapsody. like all primitive folk,
the [[slave]] stood near to nature’s [[heart]]. [[life]] was a “rough and rolling
sea” like the brown atlantic of the sea islands; the “wilderness” was
the [[home]] of [[god]], and the “lonesome valley” [[led]] to the way of [[life]].
“winter’ll soon be over,” was the picture of [[life]] and [[death]] to a
tropical [[imagination]]. the sudden wild thunderstorms of the south awed
and impressed the negroes,—at times [[time]] the rumbling seemed to them
“mournful,” at times [[time]] imperious:

“my [[lord]] calls me,
he calls me by the thunder,
the trumpet sounds it in my [[soul]].”


the monotonous toil and exposure is painted in many words. one sees the
ploughmen in the hot, moist furrow, singing:

“dere’s no rain to wet you,
dere’s no sun to burn you,
oh, push along, believer,
i want to go [[home]].”


the bowed and bent old [[man]] cries, with thrice-repeated wail:

“o [[lord]], keep me from sinking down,”


and he rebukes the [[devil]] of [[doubt]] who can whisper:

“jesus is [[dead]] and [[god’s]] gone away.”


yet the soul-hunger is there, the restlessness of the savage, the wail
of the wanderer, and the plaint is put in one little phrase:

[illustration]

over the inner thoughts [[thought]] of the slaves [[slave]] and their relations one with
another the shadow of [[fear]] ever hung, so that we get but glimpses here
and there, and also with them, eloquent omissions and silences. mother
and child are sung, but seldom [[father]]; fugitive and weary wanderer call
for [[pity]] and affection, but there is little of wooing and wedding; the
rocks and the mountains are well known, but [[home]] is unknown. strange
blending of [[love]] and helplessness sings through the refrain:

“yonder’s my ole mudder,
been waggin’ at de hill so long;
’bout [[time]] she cross over,
git [[home]] bime-by.”


elsewhere comes the cry of the “motherless” and the “farewell,
farewell, my only child.”

love-songs are scarce and fall into two categories—the frivolous and
light, and the [[sad]]. of deep successful [[love]] there is ominous [[silence]],
and in one of the oldest of these songs [[song]] there is a depth of [[history]] and
meaning:

[illustration]

a black woman said of the [[song]], “it can’t be sung without a full heart
and a troubled sperrit.” the same voice sings here that sings in the
german folk-song:

“jetz geh i’ an’s brunele, trink’ aber net.”


of [[death]] the negro showed little [[fear]], but talked of it familiarly and
even fondly as simply a crossing of the waters, perhaps—who knows [[know]]?—back
to his ancient forests again. later days transfigured his fatalism, and
amid the dust and dirt the toiler sang:

“dust, dust and ashes, fly over my grave,
but the [[lord]] shall bear my spirit [[home]].”


the things evidently borrowed from the surrounding [[world]] undergo
characteristic [[change]] when they enter the mouth of the [[slave]].
especially is this true of bible phrases. “weep, o captive [[daughter]] of
zion,” is quaintly turned into “zion, weep-a-low,” and the wheels of
ezekiel are turned every way in the mystic dreaming of the [[slave]], till
he says:

there’s a little wheel a-turnin’ in-a-my [[heart]].”


as in olden [[time]], the words of these hymns were improvised by some
leading minstrel of the [[religious]] band. the circumstances of the
gathering, however, the rhythm of the songs [[song]], and the limitations of
allowable [[thought]], confined the poetry for the most part to [[single]] or
double lines, and they seldom were expanded to quatrains or longer
tales, although there are some few examples [[example]] of sustained efforts,
chiefly paraphrases of the bible. three short series of verses have
always attracted me,—the one that heads this [[chapter]], of one line of
which thomas wentworth higginson has fittingly said, “never, it seems
to me, since [[man]] first lived and [[suffered]] was his infinite longing for
peace uttered more plaintively.” the second and third are descriptions
of the [[last]] [[judgment]],—the one a late improvisation, with some traces of
outside influence:

“oh, the stars in the elements are falling,
and the moon drips away into [[blood]],
and the ransomed of the [[lord]] are returning unto [[god]],
blessed be the name of the [[lord]].”


and the other earlier and homelier picture from the low coast lands [[land]]:

“michael, haul the boat ashore,
then you’ll hear the horn they blow,
then you’ll hear the trumpet sound,
trumpet sound the [[world]] around,
trumpet sound for [[rich]] and [[poor]],
trumpet sound the jubilee,
trumpet sound for you and me.”


through all the [[sorrow]] of the [[sorrow]] songs [[song]] there breathes a hope—a
faith in the ultimate [[justice]] of things. the minor cadences of despair
change often to triumph and calm confidence. sometimes it is [[faith]] in
life, sometimes a [[faith]] in [[death]], sometimes assurance of boundless
justice in some [[fair]] [[world]] beyond. but whichever it is, the meaning is
always clear: that sometime, somewhere, [[men]] will [[judge]] [[men]] by their
souls and not by their skins. is such a [[hope]] justified? do the sorrow
songs sing true?

the silently growing assumption of this [[age]] is that the probation of
races is [[past]], and that the backward races [[race]] of to-day are of proven
inefficiency and not worth the saving. such an assumption is the
arrogance of peoples [[people]] irreverent toward [[time]] and ignorant of the deeds
of [[men]]. a thousand years ago such an assumption, easily possible, would
have made it difficult for the teuton to prove his [[right]] to [[life]]. two
thousand years ago such dogmatism, readily welcome, would have scouted
the [[idea]] of blond races [[race]] ever leading [[civilization]]. so wofully
unorganized is sociological [[knowledge]] that the meaning of [[progress]], the
meaning of “swift” and “slow” in [[human]] doing, and the limits of human
perfectability, are veiled, unanswered sphinxes on the shores of
science. why should æschylus have sung two thousand years before
shakespeare was born? why has [[civilization]] flourished in [[europe]], and
flickered, flamed, and died in [[africa]]? so long as the [[world]] stands
meekly dumb before such questions [[question]], shall this nation proclaim its
ignorance and unhallowed prejudices by denying [[freedom]] of opportunity
to those who brought the [[sorrow]] songs [[song]] to the seats of the mighty?

your [[country]]? how came it yours? before the pilgrims landed we were
here. here we have brought our three gifts and mingled them with yours:
a gift of story and song—soft, stirring melody in an ill-harmonized and
unmelodious [[land]]; the gift of sweat and brawn to beat back the
wilderness, conquer the soil, and lay the foundations of this vast
economic [[empire]] two hundred years earlier than your [[weak]] hands could
have done it; the third, a gift of the spirit. around us the [[history]] of
the [[land]] has centred for thrice a hundred years; out of the nation’s
heart we have called all that was [[best]] to throttle and subdue all that
was worst; [[fire]] and [[blood]], prayer and [[sacrifice]], have billowed over
this [[people]], and they have found [[peace]] only in the altars of the [[god]] of
right. nor has our gift of the spirit been merely passive. actively we
have woven ourselves with the very warp and woof of this nation,—we
fought their battles [[battle]], shared their [[sorrow]], mingled our [[blood]] with
theirs, and [[generation]] after [[generation]] have pleaded with a headstrong,
careless [[people]] to despise not [[justice]], [[mercy]], and [[truth]], lest the
nation be smitten with a curse. our [[song]], our toil, our cheer, and
warning have been given to this nation in blood-brotherhood. are not
these gifts worth the giving? is not this [[work]] and striving? would
america have been [[america]] without her negro [[people]]?

even so is the [[hope]] that sang in the songs [[song]] of my fathers [[father]] well sung. if
somewhere in this whirl and [[chaos]] of things there dwells eternal [[good]],
pitiful yet masterful, then anon in his [[good]] [[time]] [[america]] shall rend
the veil and the prisoned shall go [[free]]. [[free]], [[free]] as the sunshine
trickling down the morning into these high windows of mine, [[free]] as
yonder fresh [[young]] voices welling up to me from the caverns of brick
and mortar below—swelling with [[song]], instinct with [[life]], tremulous
treble and darkening bass. my [[children]], my little [[children]], are singing
to the sunshine, and thus they sing:

and the traveller girds himself, and sets his face toward the morning,
and goes his way.




the afterthought

hear my cry, o [[god]] the reader; vouchsafe that this my [[book]] fall not
still-born into the [[world]] wilderness. let there spring, gentle one,
from out its leaves vigor of [[thought]] and thoughtful deed to reap the
harvest wonderful. let the ears of a guilty [[people]] tingle with [[truth]],
and seventy millions sigh for the [[righteousness]] which exalteth nations,
in this drear day when [[human]] brotherhood is mockery and a snare. thus
in thy [[good]] [[time]] may infinite [[reason]] turn the tangle straight, and
these crooked marks on a fragile leaf be not indeed
