act i

scene i. venice. a street.

 enter antonio, salarino and solanio.

antonio.
in sooth i [[know]] not why i am so [[sad]],
it wearies me. you say it wearies you;
but how i caught it, found it, or came by it,
what stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,
i am to learn.
and such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
that i have much ado to [[know]] myself.

salarino.
your [[mind]] is tossing on the ocean,
there where your argosies, with portly sail
like signiors and [[rich]] burghers on the flood,
or as it were the pageants of the sea,
do overpeer the petty traffickers
that curtsy to them, do them reverence,
as they fly by them with their woven wings.

solanio.
believe me, sir, had i such venture forth,
the [[better]] part of my affections would
be with my hopes [[hope]] abroad. i should be still
plucking the grass to [[know]] where sits the wind,
peering in maps for ports, and piers and roads;
and every object that might make me fear
misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
would make me [[sad]].

salarino.
my wind cooling my broth
would blow me to an ague when i thought
what harm a wind too [[great]] might do at sea.
i should not see the sandy hour-glass run
but i should [[think]] of shallows and of flats,
and see my wealthy andrew dock’d in sand,
vailing her high top lower than her ribs
to kiss her burial. should i go to church
and see the holy edifice of stone
and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,
would scatter all her spices on the stream,
enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
and, in a word, but even now worth this,
and now worth nothing? shall i have the thought
to [[think]] on this, and shall i lack the thought
that such a thing bechanc’d would make me [[sad]]?
but tell not me, i [[know]] antonio
is [[sad]] to [[think]] upon his merchandise.

antonio.
believe me, no. i thank my [[fortune]] for it,
my ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
upon the [[fortune]] of this [[present]] year.
therefore my merchandise makes me not [[sad]].

salarino.
why then you are in [[love]].

antonio.
fie, fie!

salarino.
not in [[love]] neither? then let us say you are sad
because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy
for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
because you are not [[sad]]. now, by two-headed janus,
nature hath fram’d [[strange]] fellows in her [[time]]:
some that will evermore peep through their [[eyes]],
and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper.
and other of such vinegar aspect
that they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile
though nestor swear the jest be laughable.

 enter bassanio, lorenzo and gratiano.

solanio.
here comes bassanio, your most [[noble]] kinsman,
gratiano, and lorenzo. fare ye well.
we leave you now with [[better]] company.

salarino.
i would have stay’d till i had made you merry,
if worthier [[friends]] had not prevented me.

antonio.
your worth is very dear in my regard.
i take it your own [[business]] calls on you,
and you embrace th’ [[occasion]] to depart.

salarino.
good morrow, my [[good]] lords [[lord]].

bassanio.
good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
you grow exceeding [[strange]]. must it be so?

salarino.
we’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.

 [_exeunt salarino and solanio._]

lorenzo.
my [[lord]] bassanio, since you have found antonio,
we two will leave you, but at dinner-time
i [[pray]] you have in [[mind]] where we must meet.

bassanio.
i will not fail you.

gratiano.
you look not well, signior antonio,
you have too much [[respect]] upon the [[world]].
they lose it that do buy it with much [[care]].
believe me, you are marvellously chang’d.

antonio.
i hold the [[world]] but as the [[world]], gratiano,
a stage, where every [[man]] must play a part,
and mine a [[sad]] one.

gratiano.
let me play the [[fool]],
with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
and let my liver rather heat with wine
than my [[heart]] cool with mortifying groans.
why should a [[man]] whose [[blood]] is warm within
sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
sleep when he wakes? and creep into the jaundice
by being peevish? i tell thee what, antonio,
(i [[love]] thee, and ’tis my [[love]] that speaks):
there are a sort of [[men]] whose visages
do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
and do a wilful stillness entertain,
with [[purpose]] to be dress’d in an opinion
of [[wisdom]], gravity, profound conceit,
as who should say, “i am sir oracle,
and when i ope my lips, let no dog bark.”
o my antonio, i do [[know]] of these
that therefore only are reputed wise
for saying nothing; when, i am very sure,
if they should speak, would almost damn those ears
which, hearing them, would call their brothers [[brother]] fools [[fool]].
i’ll tell thee more of this another [[time]].
but fish not with this melancholy bait
for this [[fool]] gudgeon, this [[opinion]].
come, [[good]] lorenzo. fare ye well a while.
i’ll end my exhortation after dinner.

lorenzo.
well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.
i must be one of these same dumb [[wise]] [[men]],
for gratiano never lets me speak.

gratiano.
well, keep me company but two years moe,
thou shalt not [[know]] the sound of thine own tongue.

antonio.
fare you well. i’ll grow a talker for this gear.

gratiano.
thanks, i’ [[faith]], for [[silence]] is only commendable
in a neat’s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.

 [_exeunt gratiano and lorenzo._]

antonio.
is that anything now?

bassanio.
gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any [[man]] in all
venice. his reasons [[reason]] are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of
chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them
they are not worth the search.

antonio.
well, tell me now what [[lady]] is the same
to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
that you today promis’d to tell me of?

bassanio.
’tis not unknown to you, antonio,
how much i have disabled mine estate
by something showing a more swelling port
than my faint means would grant continuance.
nor do i now make moan to be abridg’d
from such a [[noble]] rate, but my [[chief]] care
is to come fairly off from the [[great]] debts
wherein my [[time]], something too prodigal,
hath left me gag’d. to you, antonio,
i owe the most in [[money]] and in [[love]],
and from your [[love]] i have a warranty
to unburden all my plots and purposes
how to get clear of all the debts i owe.

antonio.
i [[pray]] you, [[good]] bassanio, let me [[know]] it;
and if it stand, as you yourself still do,
within the eye of [[honour]], be assur’d
my purse, my [[person]], my extremest means
lie all unlock’d to your occasions [[occasion]].

bassanio.
in my school-days, when i had lost one shaft,
i shot his fellow of the self-same flight
the self-same way, with more advised watch
to find the other forth; and by adventuring both
i oft found both. i urge this [[childhood]] proof
because what follows is pure innocence.
i owe you much, and, like a wilful [[youth]],
that which i owe is lost. but if you please
to shoot another arrow that [[self]] way
which you did shoot the first, i do not [[doubt]],
as i will watch the aim, or to find both,
or bring your latter hazard back again,
and thankfully rest debtor for the first.

antonio.
you [[know]] me well, and herein spend but time
to wind about my [[love]] with circumstance;
and out of [[doubt]] you do me now more wrong
in making [[question]] of my uttermost
than if you had made waste of all i have.
then do but say to me what i should do
that in your [[knowledge]] may by me be done,
and i am prest unto it. therefore, speak.

bassanio.
in belmont is a [[lady]] richly left,
and she is [[fair]], and, fairer than that word,
of wondrous virtues [[virtue]]. sometimes from her eyes
i did receive [[fair]] speechless messages:
her name is portia, nothing undervalu’d
to cato’s [[daughter]], brutus’ portia.
nor is the wide [[world]] ignorant of her worth,
for the four winds blow in from every coast
renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
hang on her temples like a golden fleece,
which makes her seat of belmont colchos’ strond,
and many jasons come in quest of her.
o my antonio, had i but the means
to hold a rival place with one of them,
i have a [[mind]] presages me such thrift
that i should questionless be fortunate.

antonio.
thou know’st that all my fortunes [[fortune]] are at sea;
neither have i [[money]] nor commodity
to raise a [[present]] sum, therefore go forth
try what my credit can in venice do;
that shall be rack’d even to the uttermost,
to furnish thee to belmont to [[fair]] portia.
go presently inquire, and so will i,
where [[money]] is, and i no [[question]] make
to have it of my trust or for my sake.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. belmont. a room in portia’s house.

 enter portia with her waiting-woman nerissa.

portia.
by my troth, nerissa, my little [[body]] is aweary of this [[great]] [[world]].

nerissa.
you would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance
as your [[good]] fortunes [[fortune]] are. and yet, for aught i see, they are as sick
that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. it is no
mean [[happiness]], therefore, to be seated in the mean. superfluity come
sooner by [[white]] hairs, but competency lives [[life]] longer.

portia.
good sentences, and well pronounc’d.

nerissa.
they would be [[better]] if well followed.

portia.
if to do were as easy as to [[know]] what were [[good]] to do, chapels had been
churches, and [[poor]] [[men’s]] cottages princes’ palaces. it is a [[good]] divine
that follows his own instructions; i can easier [[teach]] twenty what were
good to be done than to be one of the twenty to [[follow]] mine own
teaching. the brain may devise laws [[law]] for the [[blood]], but a hot temper
leaps o’er a cold decree; such a hare is madness the [[youth]], to skip
o’er the meshes of [[good]] counsel the cripple. but this reasoning is not
in the [[fashion]] to choose me a husband. o me, the word “choose”! i may
neither choose who i would nor refuse who i dislike, so is the will of
a living [[daughter]] curb’d by the will of a [[dead]] [[father]]. is it not hard,
nerissa, that i cannot choose one, nor refuse none?

nerissa.
your [[father]] was ever [[virtuous]], and holy [[men]] at their [[death]] have good
inspirations. therefore the lott’ry that he hath devised in these three
chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
chooses you, will no [[doubt]] never be chosen by any rightly but one who
you shall rightly [[love]]. but what warmth is there in your affection
towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?

portia.
i [[pray]] thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, i will describe
them, and according to my description level at my affection.

nerissa.
first, there is the neapolitan [[prince]].

portia.
ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse,
and he makes it a [[great]] appropriation to his own [[good]] parts that he can
shoe him himself. i am much afeard my [[lady]] his [[mother]] play’d false with
a smith.

nerissa.
then is there the county palatine.

portia.
he doth nothing but frown, as who should say “and you will not have me,
choose.” he hears merry tales and smiles not. i [[fear]] he will prove the
weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly
sadness in his [[youth]]. i had rather be [[married]] to a death’s-head with a
bone in his mouth than to either of these. [[god]] defend me from these
two!

nerissa.
how say you by the french [[lord]], monsieur le bon?

portia.
god made him, and therefore let him pass for a [[man]]. in [[truth]], i [[know]] it
is a [[sin]] to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse [[better]] than the
neapolitan’s, a [[better]] [[bad]] habit of frowning than the count palatine.
he is every [[man]] in no [[man]]. if a throstle sing, he falls straight
a-cap’ring. he will fence with his own shadow. if i should [[marry]] him, i
should [[marry]] twenty husbands. if he would despise me, i would forgive
him, for if he [[love]] me to madness, i shall never requite him.

nerissa.
what say you then to falconbridge, the [[young]] baron of [[england]]?

portia.
you [[know]] i say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor i him: he
hath neither latin, french, nor italian, and you will come into the
court and swear that i have a [[poor]] pennyworth in the english. he is a
proper man’s picture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? how
oddly he is suited! i [[think]] he bought his doublet in [[italy]], his round
hose in [[france]], his bonnet in germany, and his behaviour everywhere.

nerissa.
what [[think]] you of the scottish [[lord]], his neighbour?

portia.
that he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the
ear of the englishman, and swore he would [[pay]] him again when he was
able. i [[think]] the frenchman became his surety, and seal’d under for
another.

nerissa.
how like you the [[young]] [[german]], the duke of saxony’s nephew?

portia.
very vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the
afternoon when he is drunk: when he is [[best]], he is a little worse than
a [[man]], and when he is worst, he is little [[better]] than a beast. and the
worst fall that ever fell, i [[hope]] i shall make shift to go without him.

nerissa.
if he should offer to choose, and choose the [[right]] casket, you should
refuse to perform your father’s will, if you should refuse to accept
him.

portia.
therefore, for [[fear]] of the worst, i [[pray]] thee set a deep glass of
rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the [[devil]] be within and
that temptation without, i [[know]] he will choose it. i will do anything,
nerissa, ere i will be [[married]] to a sponge.

nerissa.
you need not [[fear]], [[lady]], the having any of these lords [[lord]]. they have
acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to
their [[home]], and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won
by some other sort than your father’s imposition, depending on the
caskets.

portia.
if i [[live]] to be as old as sibylla, i will [[die]] as chaste as diana,
unless i be obtained by the manner of my father’s will. i am glad this
parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but
i dote on his very absence. and i [[pray]] [[god]] grant them a [[fair]] departure.

nerissa.
do you not [[remember]], [[lady]], in your father’s [[time]], a venetian, a scholar
and a soldier, that came hither in company of the marquis of
montferrat?

portia.
yes, yes, it was bassanio, as i [[think]], so was he call’d.

nerissa.
true, madam. he, of all the [[men]] that ever my foolish [[eyes]] look’d upon,
was the [[best]] deserving a [[fair]] [[lady]].

portia.
i [[remember]] him well, and i [[remember]] him worthy of thy [[praise]].

 enter a servingman.

how now! what news?

servingman.
the four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. and there
is a forerunner come from a fifth, the [[prince]] of morocco, who brings
word the [[prince]] his master will be here tonight.

portia.
if i could bid the fifth welcome with so [[good]] [[heart]] as i can bid the
other four farewell, i should be glad of his approach. if he have the
condition of a saint and the [[complexion]] of a [[devil]], i had rather he
should shrive me than wive me. come, nerissa. sirrah, go before. whiles
we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. venice. a [[public]] place.

 enter bassanio with shylock the jew.

shylock.
three thousand ducats, well.

bassanio.
ay, sir, for three months.

shylock.
for three months, well.

bassanio.
for the which, as i told you, antonio shall be bound.

shylock.
antonio shall become bound, well.

bassanio.
may you stead me? will you [[pleasure]] me? shall i [[know]] your [[answer]]?

shylock.
three thousand ducats for three months, and antonio bound.

bassanio.
your [[answer]] to that.

shylock.
antonio is a [[good]] [[man]].

bassanio.
have you heard any imputation to the contrary?

shylock.
ho, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a [[good]] [[man]] is to have
you [[understand]] me that he is sufficient. yet his means are in
supposition: he hath an argosy bound to tripolis, another to the
indies. i [[understand]], moreover, upon the rialto, he hath a third at
mexico, a fourth for [[england]], and other ventures he hath squandered
abroad. but ships are but boards, sailors but [[men]]; there be land-rats
and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves—i mean pirates—and then
there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. the [[man]] is,
notwithstanding, sufficient. three thousand ducats. i [[think]] i may take
his bond.

bassanio.
be assured you may.

shylock.
i will be assured i may. and that i may be assured, i will bethink me.
may i speak with antonio?

bassanio.
if it please you to dine with us.

shylock.
yes, to smell pork, to [[eat]] of the habitation which your [[prophet]], the
nazarite, conjured the [[devil]] into. i will buy with you, sell with you,
talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but i will not [[eat]] with
you, drink with you, nor [[pray]] with you. what news on the rialto? who is
he comes here?

 enter antonio.

bassanio.
this is signior antonio.

shylock.
[_aside._] how like a fawning publican he looks!
i hate him for he is a [[christian]],
but more for that in low simplicity
he lends out [[money]] gratis, and brings down
the rate of usance here with us in venice.
if i can catch him once upon the hip,
i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him.
he hates our [[sacred]] nation, and he rails,
even there where merchants most do congregate,
on me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,
which he calls interest. cursed be my tribe
if i [[forgive]] him!

bassanio.
shylock, do you hear?

shylock.
i am debating of my [[present]] store,
and by the near guess of my memory
i cannot instantly raise up the gross
of full three thousand ducats. what of that?
tubal, a wealthy [[hebrew]] of my tribe,
will furnish me. but soft! how many months
do you [[desire]]? [_to antonio._] rest you [[fair]], [[good]] signior,
your [[worship]] was the [[last]] [[man]] in our mouths.

antonio.
shylock, albeit i neither lend nor borrow
by taking nor by giving of excess,
yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
i’ll break a custom. [_to bassanio._] is he yet possess’d
how much ye would?

shylock.
ay, ay, three thousand ducats.

antonio.
and for three months.

shylock.
i had forgot, three months, you told me so.
well then, your bond. and let me see, but hear you,
methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
upon advantage.

antonio.
i do never use it.

shylock.
when jacob graz’d his uncle laban’s sheep,—
this jacob from our holy abram was
as his [[wise]] [[mother]] wrought in his behalf,
the third possessor; ay, he was the third.

antonio.
and what of him? did he take interest?

shylock.
no, not take interest, not, as you would say,
directly interest; mark what jacob did.
when laban and himself were compromis’d
that all the eanlings which were streak’d and pied
should fall as jacob’s hire, the ewes being rank
in end of autumn turned to the rams,
and when the [[work]] of [[generation]] was
between these woolly breeders in the act,
the skilful shepherd pill’d me [[certain]] wands,
and in the doing of the deed of [[kind]],
he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
who then conceiving did in eaning time
fall parti-colour’d lambs, and those were jacob’s.
this was a way to thrive, and he was blest;
and thrift is blessing if [[men]] steal it not.

antonio.
this was a venture, sir, that jacob serv’d for,
a thing not in his [[power]] to bring to pass,
but sway’d and fashion’d by the hand of [[heaven]].
was this inserted to make interest [[good]]?
or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?

shylock.
i cannot tell; i make it breed as fast.
but note me, signior.

antonio.
mark you this, bassanio,
the [[devil]] can cite [[scripture]] for his [[purpose]].
an [[evil]] [[soul]] producing holy witness
is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
a goodly apple rotten at the [[heart]].
o, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!

shylock.
three thousand ducats, ’tis a [[good]] round sum.
three months from twelve, then let me see the rate.

antonio.
well, shylock, shall we be beholding to you?

shylock.
signior antonio, many a [[time]] and oft
in the rialto you have rated me
about my moneys and my usances.
still have i borne it with a patient shrug,
(for suff’rance is the badge of all our tribe.)
you call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
and spet upon my jewish gaberdine,
and all for use of that which is mine own.
well then, it now appears you need my [[help]].
go to, then, you come to me, and you say
“shylock, we would have moneys.” you say so:
you that did void your rheum upon my beard,
and foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
over your threshold, moneys is your suit.
what should i say to you? should i not say
“hath a dog [[money]]? is it possible
a cur can lend three thousand ducats?” or
shall i bend low and, in a bondman’s key,
with bated breath and whisp’ring humbleness,
say this:
“fair sir, you spet on me on wednesday [[last]];
you spurn’d me such a day; another time
you call’d me dog; and for these courtesies
i’ll lend you thus much moneys”?

antonio.
i am as like to call thee so again,
to spet on thee again, to spurn thee too.
if thou wilt lend this [[money]], lend it not
as to thy [[friends]], for when did [[friendship]] take
a breed for barren metal of his friend?
but lend it rather to thine [[enemy]],
who if he break, thou mayst with [[better]] face
exact the penalty.

shylock.
why, look you how you storm!
i would be [[friends]] with you, and have your [[love]],
forget the shames that you have stain’d me with,
supply your [[present]] wants, and take no doit
of usance for my moneys, and you’ll not hear me,
this is [[kind]] i offer.

bassanio.
this were [[kindness]].

shylock.
this [[kindness]] will i show.
go with me to a notary, seal me there
your [[single]] bond; and in a merry [[sport]],
if you repay me not on such a day,
in such a place, such sum or sums as are
express’d in the condition, let the forfeit
be nominated for an [[equal]] pound
of your [[fair]] flesh, to be cut off and taken
in what part of your [[body]] pleaseth me.

antonio.
content, in [[faith]], i’ll seal to such a bond,
and say there is much [[kindness]] in the jew.

bassanio.
you shall not seal to such a bond for me,
i’ll rather dwell in my necessity.

antonio.
why, [[fear]] not, [[man]], i will not forfeit it,
within these two months, that’s a month before
this bond expires, i do expect return
of thrice three times [[time]] the value of this bond.

shylock.
o [[father]] abram, what these christians [[christian]] are,
whose own hard dealings teaches [[teach]] them suspect
the thoughts [[thought]] of others. [[pray]] you, tell me this,
if he should break his day, what should i gain
by the exaction of the forfeiture?
a pound of man’s flesh, taken from a [[man]],
is not so estimable, profitable neither,
as flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. i say,
to buy his favour, i extend this [[friendship]].
if he will take it, so. if not, adieu,
and for my [[love]] i [[pray]] you [[wrong]] me not.

antonio.
yes, shylock, i will seal unto this bond.

shylock.
then meet me forthwith at the notary’s,
give him direction for this merry bond,
and i will go and purse the ducats straight,
see to my house left in the fearful guard
of an unthrifty knave, and presently
i’ll be with you.

antonio.
hie thee, gentle jew.

 [_exit shylock._]

this [[hebrew]] will turn [[christian]]; he grows [[kind]].

bassanio.
i like not [[fair]] terms and a villain’s [[mind]].

antonio.
come on; in this there can be no dismay;
my ships come [[home]] a month before the day.

 [_exeunt._]


act ii

scene i. belmont. a room in portia’s house.

 flourish of cornets. enter the [[prince]] of morocco, a tawny moor all in
 [[white]], and three or four followers accordingly, with portia, nerissa
 and their train.

prince of morocco.
mislike me not for my [[complexion]],
the shadowed livery of the burnish’d sun,
to whom i am a neighbour, and near bred.
bring me the fairest creature northward born,
where phœbus’ [[fire]] scarce thaws the icicles,
and let us make incision for your love
to prove whose [[blood]] is reddest, his or mine.
i tell thee, [[lady]], this aspect of mine
hath fear’d the valiant; by my [[love]] i swear
the best-regarded virgins of our clime
have lov’d it too. i would not [[change]] this hue,
except to steal your thoughts [[thought]], my gentle queen.

portia.
in terms of [[choice]] i am not solely led
by nice direction of a maiden’s [[eyes]];
besides, the lott’ry of my destiny
bars me the [[right]] of voluntary choosing.
but if my [[father]] had not scanted me
and hedg’d me by his wit to yield myself
his [[wife]] who wins me by that means i told you,
yourself, renowned [[prince]], then stood as fair
as any comer i have look’d on yet
for my affection.

prince of morocco.
even for that i thank you.
therefore i [[pray]] you lead me to the caskets
to try my [[fortune]]. by this scimitar
that slew the sophy and a persian [[prince]],
that won three fields of sultan solyman,
i would o’erstare the sternest [[eyes]] that look,
outbrave the [[heart]] most daring on the [[earth]],
pluck the [[young]] sucking cubs from the she-bear,
yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
to [[win]] thee, [[lady]]. but, alas the while!
if hercules and lichas play at dice
which is the [[better]] [[man]], the greater throw
may turn by [[fortune]] from the weaker hand:
so is alcides beaten by his rage,
and so may i, blind [[fortune]] leading me,
miss that which one unworthier may attain,
and [[die]] with grieving.

portia.
you must take your [[chance]],
and either not attempt to choose at all,
or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
never to speak to [[lady]] afterward
in way of [[marriage]]. therefore be advis’d.

prince of morocco.
nor will not. come, bring me unto my [[chance]].

portia.
first, forward to the temple. after dinner
your hazard shall be made.

prince of morocco.
good [[fortune]] then,
to make me blest or cursed’st among men!

scene ii. venice. a street.

 enter launcelet gobbo, the clown, alone.

launcelet.
certainly my [[conscience]] will serve me to run from this jew my master.
the fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me “gobbo,
launcelet gobbo, [[good]] launcelet” or “good gobbo,” or “good launcelet
gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.” my [[conscience]] says
“no; take heed, honest launcelet, take heed, honest gobbo” or, as
aforesaid, “honest launcelet gobbo, do not run, scorn running with thy
heels.” well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. “fia!” says the
fiend, “away!” says the fiend. “for the heavens [[heaven]], rouse up a brave
mind,” says the fiend “and run.” well, my [[conscience]], hanging about the
neck of my [[heart]], says very wisely to me “my honest friend launcelet,
being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s [[son]], for indeed
my [[father]] did something smack, something grow to, he had a [[kind]] of
taste;—well, my [[conscience]] says “launcelet, budge not.” “budge,” says
the fiend. “budge not,” says my [[conscience]]. “conscience,” say i, “you
counsel well.” “fiend,” say i, “you counsel well.” to be ruled by my
conscience, i should stay with the jew my master, who, (god bless the
mark) is a [[kind]] of [[devil]]; and, to run away from the jew, i should be
ruled by the fiend, who (saving your reverence) is the [[devil]] himself.
certainly the jew is the very [[devil]] incarnation, and, in my [[conscience]],
my [[conscience]] is but a [[kind]] of hard [[conscience]], to offer to counsel me
to stay with the jew. the fiend gives the more friendly counsel. i will
run, fiend, my heels are at your commandment, i will run.

 enter old gobbo with a basket.

gobbo.
master [[young]] [[man]], you, i [[pray]] you; which is the way to master jew’s?

launcelet.
[_aside._] o heavens [[heaven]], this is my true-begotten [[father]], who being more
than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows [[know]] me not. i will try confusions
with him.

gobbo.
master [[young]] gentleman, i [[pray]] you, which is the way to master jew’s?

launcelet.
turn up on your [[right]] hand at the next turning, but at the next turning
of all on your left; [[marry]], at the very next turning, turn of no hand,
but turn down indirectly to the jew’s house.

gobbo.
be [[god’s]] sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit. can you tell me whether
one launcelet, that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?

launcelet.
talk you of [[young]] master launcelet? [_aside._] mark me now, now will i
raise the waters. talk you of [[young]] master launcelet?

gobbo.
no master, sir, but a [[poor]] man’s [[son]], his [[father]], though i say’t, is an
honest exceeding [[poor]] [[man]], and, [[god]] be thanked, well to [[live]].

launcelet.
well, let his [[father]] be what he will, we talk of [[young]] master
launcelet.

gobbo.
your worship’s friend, and launcelet, sir.

launcelet.
but i [[pray]] you, _ergo_, old [[man]], _ergo_, i beseech you, talk you of
young master launcelet?

gobbo.
of launcelet, an’t please your mastership.

launcelet.
_ergo_, master launcelet. talk not of master launcelet, [[father]], for the
young gentleman, according to fates [[fate]] and destinies, and such odd
sayings, the sisters three and such branches of learning, is indeed
deceased, or, as you would say in plain terms, gone to [[heaven]].

gobbo.
marry, [[god]] forbid! the boy was the very staff of my [[age]], my very prop.

launcelet.
[_aside._] do i look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop?
do you [[know]] me, [[father]]?

gobbo.
alack the day! i [[know]] you not, [[young]] gentleman, but i [[pray]] you tell me,
is my boy, [[god]] rest his [[soul]], alive or [[dead]]?

launcelet.
do you not [[know]] me, [[father]]?

gobbo.
alack, sir, i am sand-blind, i [[know]] you not.

launcelet.
nay, indeed, if you had your [[eyes]], you might fail of the knowing me: it
is a [[wise]] [[father]] that knows [[know]] his own child. well, old [[man]], i will tell
you news of your [[son]]. give me your blessing, [[truth]] will come to [[light]],
murder cannot be hid long, a man’s [[son]] may, but in the end [[truth]] will
out.

gobbo.
pray you, sir, stand up, i am sure you are not launcelet my boy.

launcelet.
pray you, let’s have no more fooling about it, but give me your
blessing. i am launcelet, your boy that was, your [[son]] that is, your
child that shall be.

gobbo.
i cannot [[think]] you are my [[son]].

launcelet.
i [[know]] not what i shall [[think]] of that; but i am launcelet, the jew’s
man, and i am sure margery your [[wife]] is my [[mother]].

gobbo.
her name is margery, indeed. i’ll be sworn if thou be launcelet, thou
art mine own flesh and [[blood]]. [[lord]] worshipped might he be, what a beard
hast thou got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than dobbin my
fill-horse has on his tail.

launcelet.
it should seem, then, that dobbin’s tail grows backward. i am sure he
had more hair on his tail than i have on my face when i [[last]] saw him.

gobbo.
lord, how art [[arts]] thou changed! how dost thou and thy master agree? i have
brought him a [[present]]. how ’gree you now?

launcelet.
well, well. but for mine own part, as i have set up my rest to run
away, so i will not rest till i have run some ground. my master’s a
very jew. give him a present! give him a halter. i am famished in his
service. you may tell every finger i have with my ribs. [[father]], i am
glad you are come, give me your [[present]] to one master bassanio, who
indeed gives rare new liveries. if i serve not him, i will run as far
as [[god]] has any ground. o rare [[fortune]], here comes the man! to him,
father; for i am a jew, if i serve the jew any longer.

 enter bassanio with leonardo and a follower or two.

bassanio.
you may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the
farthest by five of the clock. see these letters delivered, put the
liveries to making, and [[desire]] gratiano to come anon to my lodging.

 [_exit a servant._]

launcelet.
to him, [[father]].

gobbo.
god bless your worship!

bassanio.
gramercy, wouldst thou aught with me?

gobbo.
here’s my [[son]], sir, a [[poor]] boy.

launcelet.
not a [[poor]] boy, sir, but the [[rich]] jew’s [[man]], that would, sir, as my
father shall specify.

gobbo.
he hath a [[great]] infection, sir, as one would say, to serve.

launcelet.
indeed the short and the long is, i serve the jew, and have a [[desire]],
as my [[father]] shall specify.

gobbo.
his master and he (saving your worship’s reverence) are scarce
cater-cousins.

launcelet.
to be brief, the very [[truth]] is that the jew, having done me [[wrong]], doth
cause me, as my [[father]], being i [[hope]] an old [[man]], shall frutify unto
you.

gobbo.
i have here a dish of doves that i would bestow upon your [[worship]], and
my suit is—

launcelet.
in very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your [[worship]] shall
know by this honest old [[man]], and though i say it, though old [[man]], yet
poor [[man]], my [[father]].

bassanio.
one speak for both. what would you?

launcelet.
serve you, sir.

gobbo.
that is the very defect of the matter, sir.

bassanio.
i [[know]] thee well; thou hast obtain’d thy suit.
shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
and hath preferr’d thee, if it be preferment
to leave a [[rich]] jew’s service to become
the follower of so [[poor]] a gentleman.

launcelet.
the old proverb is very well parted between my master shylock and you,
sir: you have “the grace of god”, sir, and he hath “enough”.

bassanio.
thou speak’st it well. go, [[father]], with thy [[son]].
take leave of thy old master, and inquire
my lodging out. [_to a servant._] give him a livery
more guarded than his fellows’; see it done.

launcelet.
father, in. i cannot get a service, no! i have ne’er a tongue in my
head! [_looking on his palm._] well, if any [[man]] in [[italy]] have a fairer
table which doth offer to swear upon a [[book]], i shall have [[good]] [[fortune]];
go to, here’s a simple line of [[life]]. here’s a small trifle of wives [[wife]],
alas, fifteen wives [[wife]] is nothing; eleven widows and nine maids is a
simple coming-in for one [[man]]. and then to scape drowning thrice, and to
be in peril of my [[life]] with the edge of a feather-bed; here are simple
’scapes. well, if [[fortune]] be a woman, she’s a [[good]] wench for this gear.
father, come; i’ll take my leave of the jew in the twinkling.

 [_exeunt launcelet and old gobbo._]

bassanio.
i [[pray]] thee, [[good]] leonardo, [[think]] on this.
these things being bought and orderly bestow’d,
return in haste, for i do feast tonight
my [[best]] esteem’d acquaintance; hie thee, go.

leonardo.
my [[best]] endeavours shall be done herein.

 enter gratiano.

gratiano.
where’s your master?

leonardo.
yonder, sir, he walks.

 [_exit._]

gratiano.
signior bassanio!

bassanio.
gratiano!

gratiano.
i have suit to you.

bassanio.
you have obtain’d it.

gratiano.
you must not deny me, i must go with you to belmont.

bassanio.
why, then you must. but hear thee, gratiano,
thou art [[arts]] too wild, too rude, and bold of voice,
parts that become thee happily enough,
and in such [[eyes]] as ours appear not faults [[fault]];
but where thou art [[arts]] not known, why there they show
something too liberal. [[pray]] thee, take pain
to allay with some cold drops of modesty
thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behaviour
i be misconst’red in the place i go to,
and lose my hopes [[hope]].

gratiano.
signior bassanio, hear me.
if i do not put on a sober habit,
talk with [[respect]], and swear but now and then,
wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,
nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
thus with my hat, and sigh, and say “amen”;
use all the observance of civility
like one well [[studied]] in a [[sad]] ostent
to please his grandam, never trust me more.

bassanio.
well, we shall see your bearing.

gratiano.
nay, but i bar tonight, you shall not gauge me
by what we do tonight.

bassanio.
no, that were [[pity]].
i would entreat you rather to put on
your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
that [[purpose]] merriment. but fare you well,
i have some [[business]].

gratiano.
and i must to lorenzo and the rest,
but we will visit you at supper-time.

 enter jessica and launcelet.

jessica.
i am [[sorry]] thou wilt leave my [[father]] so.
our house is hell, and thou, a merry [[devil]],
didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
but fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee,
and, launcelet, soon at supper shalt thou see
lorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest.
give him this letter, do it secretly.
and so farewell. i would not have my father
see me in talk with thee.

launcelet.
adieu! tears exhibit my tongue, most beautiful pagan, most sweet jew!
if a [[christian]] do not play the knave and get thee, i am much deceived.
but, adieu! these foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit.
adieu!

jessica.
farewell, [[good]] launcelet.

 [_exit launcelet._]

alack, what heinous [[sin]] is it in me
to be ashamed to be my father’s child!
but though i am a [[daughter]] to his [[blood]],
i am not to his manners. o lorenzo,
if thou keep promise, i shall end this strife,
become a [[christian]] and thy loving [[wife]].

 [_exit._]

scene iv. the same. a street.

 enter gratiano, lorenzo, salarino and solanio.

lorenzo.
nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
disguise us at my lodging, and return
all in an hour.

gratiano.
we have not made [[good]] preparation.

salarino.
we have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.

solanio.
’tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order’d,
and [[better]] in my [[mind]] not undertook.

lorenzo.
’tis now but four o’clock, we have two hours
to furnish us.

 enter launcelet with a letter.

friend launcelet, what’s the news?

launcelet.
and it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem to signify.

lorenzo.
i [[know]] the hand, in [[faith]] ’tis a [[fair]] hand,
and whiter than the paper it writ on
is the [[fair]] hand that writ.

gratiano.
love news, in [[faith]].

launcelet.
by your leave, sir.

lorenzo.
whither goest thou?

launcelet.
marry, sir, to bid my old master the jew to sup tonight with my new
master the [[christian]].

lorenzo.
hold here, take this. tell gentle jessica
i will not fail her, speak it privately.
go, gentlemen,

 [_exit launcelet._]

will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
i am provided of a torch-bearer.

salarino.
ay, [[marry]], i’ll be gone about it straight.

solanio.
and so will i.

lorenzo.
meet me and gratiano
at gratiano’s lodging some hour hence.

salarino.
’tis [[good]] we do so.

 [_exeunt salarino and solanio._]

gratiano.
was not that letter from [[fair]] jessica?

lorenzo.
i must needs tell thee all. she hath directed
how i shall take her from her father’s house,
what gold and jewels she is furnish’d with,
what page’s suit she hath in readiness.
if e’er the jew her [[father]] come to [[heaven]],
it will be for his gentle daughter’s sake;
and never dare misfortune cross her foot,
unless she do it under this excuse,
that she is issue to a faithless jew.
come, go with me, peruse this as thou goest;
fair jessica shall be my torch-bearer.

 [_exeunt._]

scene v. the same. before shylock’s house.

 enter shylock the jew and launcelet his [[man]] that was the clown.

shylock.
well, thou shalt see, thy [[eyes]] shall be thy [[judge]],
the difference of old shylock and bassanio.—
what, jessica!—thou shalt not gormandize
as thou hast done with me;—what, jessica!—
and sleep, and snore, and rend apparel out.
why, jessica, i say!

launcelet.
why, jessica!

shylock.
who bids thee call? i do not bid thee call.

launcelet.
your [[worship]] was wont to tell me i could do nothing without bidding.

 enter jessica.

jessica.
call you? what is your will?

shylock.
i am bid forth to supper, jessica.
there are my keys. but wherefore should i go?
i am not bid for [[love]], they flatter me.
but yet i’ll go in hate, to feed upon
the prodigal [[christian]]. jessica, my girl,
look to my house. i am [[right]] loath to go;
there is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
for i did [[dream]] of money-bags tonight.

launcelet.
i beseech you, sir, go. my [[young]] master doth expect your reproach.

shylock.
so do i his.

launcelet.
and they have conspired together. i will not say you shall see a
masque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell
a-bleeding on black monday [[last]] at six o’clock i’ th’ morning, falling
out that year on ash-wednesday was four year in th’ afternoon.

shylock.
what, are there masques? hear you me, jessica,
lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum
and the vile squealing of the wry-neck’d fife,
clamber not you up to the casements then,
nor thrust your head into the [[public]] street
to gaze on [[christian]] fools [[fool]] with varnish’d faces,
but stop my house’s ears, i mean my casements.
let not the sound of shallow fopp’ry enter
my sober house. by jacob’s staff i swear
i have no [[mind]] of feasting forth tonight.
but i will go. go you before me, sirrah.
say i will come.

launcelet.
i will go before, sir.
mistress, look out at window for all this.
    there will come a [[christian]] by
    will be worth a jewess’ eye.

 [_exit launcelet._]

shylock.
what says that [[fool]] of hagar’s offspring, ha?

jessica.
his words were “farewell, mistress,” nothing else.

shylock.
the patch is [[kind]] enough, but a huge feeder,
snail-slow in [[profit]], and he sleeps by day
more than the wild-cat. drones hive not with me,
therefore i part with him, and part with him
to one that i would have him [[help]] to waste
his borrowed purse. well, jessica, go in.
perhaps i will return immediately:
do as i bid you, shut doors after you,
“fast bind, fast find.”
a proverb never stale in thrifty [[mind]].

 [_exit._]

jessica.
farewell, and if my [[fortune]] be not crost,
i have a [[father]], you a [[daughter]], lost.

 [_exit._]

gratiano.
this is the penthouse under which lorenzo
desired us to make stand.

salarino.
his hour is almost [[past]].

gratiano.
and it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
for lovers ever run before the clock.

salarino.
o ten times [[time]] faster venus’ pigeons fly
to seal love’s bonds new-made than they are wont
to keep obliged [[faith]] unforfeited!

gratiano.
that ever holds: who riseth from a feast
with that keen appetite that he sits down?
where is the horse that doth untread again
his tedious measures with the unbated fire
that he did pace them first? all things that are,
are with more spirit chased than enjoy’d.
how like a younger or a prodigal
the scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
hugg’d and embraced by the strumpet wind!
how like the prodigal doth she return
with over-weather’d ribs and ragged sails,
lean, rent, and beggar’d by the strumpet wind!

 enter lorenzo.

salarino.
here comes lorenzo, more of this hereafter.

lorenzo.
sweet [[friends]], your patience for my long abode.
not i but my affairs have made you wait.
when you shall please to play the thieves for wives [[wife]],
i’ll watch as long for you then. approach.
here dwells my [[father]] jew. ho! who’s within?

 enter jessica above, in boy’s clothes.

jessica.
who are you? tell me, for more certainty,
albeit i’ll swear that i do [[know]] your tongue.

lorenzo.
lorenzo, and thy [[love]].

jessica.
lorenzo [[certain]], and my [[love]] indeed,
for who [[love]] i so much? and now who knows
but you, lorenzo, whether i am yours?

lorenzo.
heaven and thy thoughts [[thought]] are witness that thou art [[arts]].

jessica.
here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains [[pain]].
i am glad ’tis night, you do not look on me,
for i am much asham’d of my exchange.
but [[love]] is blind, and lovers cannot see
the pretty follies that themselves commit,
for if they could, cupid himself would blush
to see me thus transformed to a boy.

lorenzo.
descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.

jessica.
what! must i hold a candle to my shames?
they in themselves, [[good]] sooth, are too too [[light]].
why, ’tis an office of discovery, [[love]],
and i should be obscur’d.

lorenzo.
so are you, sweet,
even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
but come at once,
for the close night doth play the runaway,
and we are stay’d for at bassanio’s feast.

jessica.
i will make fast the doors, and gild myself
with some moe ducats, and be with you straight.

 [_exit above._]

gratiano.
now, by my hood, a gentle, and no jew.

lorenzo.
beshrew me but i [[love]] her heartily,
for she is [[wise]], if i can [[judge]] of her,
and [[fair]] she is, if that mine [[eyes]] be true,
and true she is, as she hath prov’d herself.
and therefore, like herself, [[wise]], [[fair]], and true,
shall she be placed in my constant [[soul]].

 enter jessica.

what, art [[arts]] thou come? on, gentlemen, away!
our masquing mates by this [[time]] for us stay.

gratiano.
signior antonio!

antonio.
fie, fie, gratiano! where are all the rest?
’tis nine o’clock, our [[friends]] all stay for you.
no masque tonight, the wind is come about;
bassanio presently will go aboard.
i have sent twenty out to seek for you.

gratiano.
i am glad on’t. i [[desire]] no more delight
than to be under sail and gone tonight.

 [_exeunt._]

scene vii. belmont. a room in portia’s house.

 flourish of cornets. enter portia with the [[prince]] of morocco and both
 their trains.

portia.
go, draw aside the curtains and discover
the several caskets to this [[noble]] [[prince]].
now make your [[choice]].

prince of morocco.
the first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
“who chooseth me shall gain what many [[men]] [[desire]].”
the second, silver, which this promise carries,
“who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”
this third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
“who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”
how shall i [[know]] if i do choose the [[right]]?

portia.
the one of them contains my picture, [[prince]].
if you choose that, then i am yours withal.

prince of morocco.
some [[god]] direct my judgment! let me see.
i will survey the inscriptions back again.
what says this leaden casket?
“who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”
must give, for what? for lead? hazard for lead!
this casket threatens; [[men]] that hazard all
do it in [[hope]] of [[fair]] advantages:
a golden [[mind]] stoops not to shows of dross,
i’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
what says the silver with her virgin hue?
“who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”
as much as he deserves! pause there, morocco,
and weigh thy value with an even hand.
if thou be’st rated by thy estimation
thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough
may not extend so far as to the [[lady]].
and yet to be afeard of my deserving
were but a [[weak]] disabling of myself.
as much as i deserve! why, that’s the [[lady]]:
i do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes [[fortune]],
in graces, and in qualities of breeding;
but more than these, in [[love]] i do deserve.
what if i stray’d no farther, but chose here?
let’s see once more this saying grav’d in gold:
“who chooseth me shall gain what many [[men]] [[desire]].”
why, that’s the [[lady]], all the [[world]] desires [[desire]] her.
from the four corners of the [[earth]] they come
to kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint.
the hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
of wide arabia are as throughfares now
for princes [[prince]] to come view [[fair]] portia.
the watery [[kingdom]], whose ambitious head
spets in the face of [[heaven]], is no bar
to stop the [[foreign]] spirits, but they come
as o’er a brook to see [[fair]] portia.
one of these three contains her heavenly picture.
is’t like that lead contains her? ’twere damnation
to [[think]] so base a [[thought]]. it were too gross
to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
or shall i [[think]] in silver she’s immur’d
being ten times [[time]] undervalued to tried gold?
o sinful thought! never so [[rich]] a gem
was set in worse than gold. they have in england
a coin that bears the figure of an angel
stamped in gold; but that’s insculp’d upon;
but here an angel in a golden bed
lies all within. deliver me the key.
here do i choose, and thrive i as i may.

portia.
there, take it, [[prince]], and if my form [[lie]] there,
then i am yours.

 [_he unlocks the golden casket._]

prince of morocco.
o hell! what have we here?
a carrion [[death]], within whose empty eye
there is a written scroll. i’ll [[read]] the writing.

     _all that glisters is not gold,
     often have you heard that told.
     many a [[man]] his [[life]] hath sold
     but my outside to behold.
     gilded tombs do worms infold.
     had you been as [[wise]] as bold,
     [[young]] in limbs, in [[judgment]] old,
     your [[answer]] had not been inscroll’d,
     fare you well, your suit is cold._

   cold indeed and [[labour]] lost,
   then farewell heat, and welcome frost.
portia, adieu! i have too griev’d a heart
to take a tedious leave. thus losers part.

 [_exit with his train. flourish of cornets._]

portia.
a gentle riddance. draw the curtains, go.
let all of his [[complexion]] choose me so.

scene viii. venice. a street.

 enter salarino and solanio.

salarino.
why, [[man]], i saw bassanio under sail;
with him is gratiano gone along;
and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not.

solanio.
the villain jew with outcries rais’d the duke,
who went with him to search bassanio’s ship.

salarino.
he came too late, the ship was under sail;
but there the duke was given to understand
that in a gondola were seen together
lorenzo and his amorous jessica.
besides, antonio certified the duke
they were not with bassanio in his ship.

solanio.
i never heard a passion so confus’d,
so [[strange]], outrageous, and so variable
as the dog jew did utter in the streets.
“my daughter! o my ducats! o my daughter!
fled with a christian! o my [[christian]] ducats!
justice! the law! my ducats and my daughter!
a sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
of double ducats, stol’n from me by my daughter!
and jewels, two stones, two [[rich]] and precious stones,
stol’n by my daughter! justice! find the girl,
she hath the stones upon her and the ducats.”

salarino.
why, all the boys in venice [[follow]] him,
crying, his stones, his [[daughter]], and his ducats.

solanio.
let [[good]] antonio look he keep his day
or he shall [[pay]] for this.

salarino.
marry, well rememb’red.
i reason’d with a frenchman yesterday,
who told me, in the narrow seas that part
the french and english, there miscarried
a vessel of our [[country]] richly fraught.
i [[thought]] upon antonio when he told me,
and wish’d in [[silence]] that it were not his.

solanio.
you were [[best]] to tell antonio what you hear,
yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.

salarino.
a kinder gentleman treads not the [[earth]].
i saw bassanio and antonio part,
bassanio told him he would make some speed
of his return. he answered “do not so,
slubber not [[business]] for my sake, bassanio,
but stay the very riping of the [[time]],
and for the jew’s bond which he hath of me,
let it not enter in your [[mind]] of [[love]]:
be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
to courtship, and such [[fair]] ostents of love
as shall conveniently become you there.”
and even there, his eye being big with tears,
turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
and with affection wondrous sensible
he wrung bassanio’s hand, and so they parted.

solanio.
i [[think]] he only loves [[love]] the [[world]] for him.
i [[pray]] thee, let us go and find him out
and quicken his embraced heaviness
with some delight or other.

salarino.
do we so.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ix. belmont. a room in portia’s house.

 enter nerissa and a servitor.

nerissa.
quick, quick, i [[pray]] thee, draw the curtain straight.
the [[prince]] of arragon hath ta’en his oath,
and comes to his election presently.

 flourish of cornets. enter the [[prince]] of arragon, his train, and
 portia.

portia.
behold, there stand the caskets, [[noble]] [[prince]],
if you choose that wherein i am contain’d,
straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz’d.
but if you fail, without more [[speech]], my [[lord]],
you must be gone from hence immediately.

arragon.
i am enjoin’d by oath to observe three things:
first, never to unfold to anyone
which casket ’twas i chose; next, if i fail
of the [[right]] casket, never in my life
to woo a maid in way of [[marriage]];
lastly,
if i do fail in [[fortune]] of my [[choice]],
immediately to leave you and be gone.

portia.
to these injunctions everyone doth swear
that comes to hazard for my worthless [[self]].

arragon.
and so have i address’d me. [[fortune]] now
to my heart’s hope! gold, silver, and base lead.
“who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”
you shall look fairer ere i give or hazard.
what says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
“who chooseth me shall gain what many [[men]] [[desire]].”
what many [[men]] desire! that “many” may be meant
by the [[fool]] multitude, that choose by show,
not learning more than the fond eye doth [[teach]],
which pries not to th’ interior, but like the martlet
builds in the weather on the outward wall,
even in the [[force]] and road of casualty.
i will not choose what many [[men]] [[desire]],
because i will not jump with [[common]] spirits
and rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house,
tell me once more what title thou dost bear.
“who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”
and well said too; for who shall go about
to cozen [[fortune]], and be honourable
without the stamp of [[merit]]? let none presume
to wear an undeserved [[dignity]].
o that estates, degrees [[degree]], and offices
were not deriv’d corruptly, and that clear honour
were purchas’d by the [[merit]] of the wearer!
how many then should cover that stand bare?
how many be commanded that command?
how much low peasantry would then be gleaned
from the true seed of [[honour]]? and how much honour
pick’d from the chaff and ruin of the times [[time]],
to be new varnish’d? well, but to my [[choice]].
“who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”
i will assume desert. give me a key for this,
and instantly unlock my fortunes [[fortune]] here.

 [_he opens the silver casket._]

portia.
too long a pause for that which you find there.

arragon.
what’s here? the portrait of a blinking idiot
presenting me a schedule! i will [[read]] it.
how much unlike art [[arts]] thou to portia!
how much unlike my hopes [[hope]] and my deservings!
“who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.”
did i deserve no more than a fool’s head?
is that my prize? are my deserts no [[better]]?

portia.
to offend and [[judge]] are distinct offices,
and of opposed natures [[nature]].

arragon.
what is here?

     _the [[fire]] seven times [[time]] tried this;
     seven times [[time]] tried that [[judgment]] is
     that did never choose amiss.
     some there be that shadows kiss;
     such have but a shadow’s bliss.
     there be fools [[fool]] alive, i wis,
     silver’d o’er, and so was this.
     take what [[wife]] you will to bed,
     i will ever be your head:
     so be gone; you are sped._

still more [[fool]] i shall appear
by the [[time]] i linger here.
with one fool’s head i came to woo,
but i go away with two.
sweet, adieu! i’ll keep my oath,
patiently to bear my wroth.

 [_exit aragon with his train._]

portia.
thus hath the candle sing’d the moth.
o, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
they have the [[wisdom]] by their wit to lose.

nerissa.
the ancient saying is no heresy:
hanging and wiving goes by [[destiny]].

portia.
come, draw the curtain, nerissa.

 enter a messenger.

messenger.
where is my [[lady]]?

portia.
here, what would my [[lord]]?

messenger.
madam, there is alighted at your gate
a [[young]] venetian, one that comes before
to signify th’ approaching of his [[lord]],
from whom he bringeth sensible regreets;
to wit (besides commends and courteous breath)
gifts of [[rich]] value; yet i have not seen
so likely an ambassador of [[love]].
a day in april never came so sweet,
to show how costly summer was at hand,
as this fore-spurrer comes before his [[lord]].

portia.
no more, i [[pray]] thee. i am half afeard
thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
thou spend’st such high-day wit in praising him.
come, come, nerissa, for i long to see
quick cupid’s post that comes so mannerly.

nerissa.
bassanio, [[lord]] [[love]], if thy will it be!

 [_exeunt._]


act iii

scene i. venice. a street.

 enter solanio and salarino.

solanio.
now, what news on the rialto?

salarino.
why, yet it lives [[life]] there unchecked that antonio hath a ship of rich
lading wrack’d on the narrow seas; the goodwins, i [[think]] they call the
place, a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many a
tall ship [[lie]] buried, as they say, if my gossip report be an honest
woman of her word.

solanio.
i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or
made her neighbours [[believe]] she wept for the [[death]] of a third husband.
but it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain
highway of talk, that the [[good]] antonio, the honest antonio,—o that i
had a title [[good]] enough to keep his name company!—

salarino.
come, the full stop.

solanio.
ha, what sayest thou? why, the end is, he hath lost a ship.

salarino.
i would it might prove the end of his losses.

solanio.
let me say “amen” betimes, lest the [[devil]] cross my prayer, for here he
comes in the likeness of a jew.

 enter shylock.

how now, shylock, what news among the merchants?

shylock.
you knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter’s flight.

salarino.
that’s [[certain]], i, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she
flew withal.

solanio.
and shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it
is the [[complexion]] of them all to leave the dam.

shylock.
she is damn’d for it.

salarino.
that’s [[certain]], if the [[devil]] may be her [[judge]].

shylock.
my own flesh and [[blood]] to rebel!

solanio.
out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?

shylock.
i say my [[daughter]] is my flesh and my [[blood]].

salarino.
there is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet
and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and
rhenish. but tell us, do you hear whether antonio have had any loss at
sea or no?

shylock.
there i have another [[bad]] match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce
show his head on the rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon
the mart; let him look to his bond. he was wont to call me usurer; let
him look to his bond: he was wont to lend [[money]] for a [[christian]] cur’sy;
let him look to his bond.

salarino.
why, i am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! what’s that
good for?

shylock.
to bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my
revenge. he hath disgrac’d me and hind’red me half a million, laugh’d
at my losses, mock’d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
bargains, cooled my [[friends]], heated mine enemies [[enemy]]. and what’s his
reason? i am a jew. hath not a jew [[eyes]]? hath not a jew hands, organs,
dimensions, senses, affections, [[passions]]? fed with the same food, hurt
with the same [[weapons]], [[subject]] to the same diseases, healed by the same
means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a christian
is? if you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not
laugh? if you poison us, do we not [[die]]? and if you [[wrong]] us, shall we
not [[revenge]]? if we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in
that. if a jew [[wrong]] a [[christian]], what is his [[humility]]? [[revenge]]. if a
christian [[wrong]] a jew, what should his sufferance be by christian
example? why, revenge! the villainy you [[teach]] me i will execute, and it
shall go hard but i will [[better]] the instruction.

 enter a [[man]] from antonio.

servant.
gentlemen, my master antonio is at his house, and desires [[desire]] to speak with
you both.

salarino.
we have been up and down to seek him.

 enter tubal.

solanio.
here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be match’d, unless the
devil himself turn jew.

 [_exeunt solanio, salarino and the servant._]

shylock.
how now, tubal, what news from genoa? hast thou found my [[daughter]]?

tubal.
i often came where i did hear of her, but cannot find her.

shylock.
why there, there, there, there! a diamond gone cost me two thousand
ducats in frankfort! the curse never fell upon our nation till now, i
never [[felt]] it till now. two thousand ducats in that, and other
precious, precious jewels. i would my [[daughter]] were [[dead]] at my foot,
and the jewels in her ear; would she were hearsed at my foot, and the
ducats in her coffin. no news of them? why so? and i [[know]] not what’s
spent in the search. why, thou—loss upon loss! the thief gone with so
much, and so much to find the thief, and no satisfaction, no [[revenge]],
nor no ill [[luck]] stirring but what lights [[light]] o’ my shoulders, no sighs but
o’ my breathing, no tears but o’ my shedding.

tubal.
yes, other [[men]] have ill [[luck]] too. antonio, as i heard in genoa—

shylock.
what, what, what? ill [[luck]], ill [[luck]]?

tubal.
—hath an argosy cast away coming from tripolis.

shylock.
i thank god! i thank god! is it true, is it true?

tubal.
i spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.

shylock.
i thank thee, [[good]] tubal. [[good]] news, [[good]] news! ha, ha, heard in genoa?

tubal.
your [[daughter]] spent in genoa, as i heard, one night, fourscore ducats.

shylock.
thou stick’st a dagger in me. i shall never see my gold again.
fourscore ducats at a sitting! fourscore ducats!

tubal.
there came divers of antonio’s creditors in my company to venice that
swear he cannot choose but break.

shylock.
i am very glad of it. i’ll plague him, i’ll torture him. i am glad of
it.

tubal.
one of them showed me a ring that he had of your [[daughter]] for a monkey.

shylock.
out upon her! thou torturest me, tubal. it was my turquoise, i had it
of leah when i was a bachelor. i would not have given it for a
wilderness of monkeys.

tubal.
but antonio is certainly undone.

shylock.
nay, that’s true, that’s very true. go, tubal, fee me an officer;
bespeak him a fortnight before. i will have the [[heart]] of him if he
forfeit, for were he out of venice i can make what merchandise i will.
go, tubal, and meet me at our synagogue. go, [[good]] tubal, at our
synagogue, tubal.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. belmont. a room in portia’s house.

 enter bassanio, portia, gratiano, nerissa and all their trains.

portia.
i [[pray]] you tarry, pause a day or two
before you hazard, for in choosing wrong
i lose your company; therefore forbear a while.
there’s something tells me (but it is not love)
i would not lose you, and you [[know]] yourself
hate counsels not in such a quality.
but lest you should not [[understand]] me well,—
and yet a maiden hath no tongue but [[thought]],—
i would detain you here some month or two
before you venture for me. i could [[teach]] you
how to choose [[right]], but then i am forsworn.
so will i never be. so may you miss me.
but if you do, you’ll make me [[wish]] a [[sin]],
that i had been forsworn. beshrew your [[eyes]],
they have o’erlook’d me and divided me.
one half of me is yours, the other half yours,
mine own, i would say; but if mine, then yours,
and so all yours. o these naughty times
puts bars between the owners and their rights!
and so though yours, not yours. prove it so,
let [[fortune]] go to hell for it, not i.
i speak too long, but ’tis to peise the [[time]],
to eche it, and to draw it out in length,
to stay you from election.

bassanio.
let me choose,
for as i am, i [[live]] upon the rack.

portia.
upon the rack, bassanio! then confess
what [[treason]] there is mingled with your [[love]].

bassanio.
none but that ugly [[treason]] of mistrust,
which makes me [[fear]] th’ enjoying of my [[love]].
there may as well be amity and life
’tween snow and [[fire]] as [[treason]] and my [[love]].

portia.
ay, but i [[fear]] you speak upon the rack
where [[men]] enforced do speak anything.

bassanio.
promise me [[life]], and i’ll confess the [[truth]].

portia.
well then, confess and [[live]].

bassanio.
“confess and love”
had been the very sum of my [[confession]]:
o [[happy]] torment, when my torturer
doth [[teach]] me answers [[answer]] for deliverance!
but let me to my [[fortune]] and the caskets.

portia.
away, then! i am lock’d in one of them.
if you do [[love]] me, you will find me out.
nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
let [[music]] sound while he doth make his [[choice]].
then if he lose he makes a swan-like end,
fading in [[music]]. that the comparison
may stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
and wat’ry death-bed for him. he may [[win]],
and what is [[music]] then? then [[music]] is
even as the flourish when true subjects [[subject]] bow
to a new-crowned monarch. such it is
as are those dulcet sounds in break of day
that creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear
and summon him to [[marriage]]. now he goes,
with no less presence, but with much more love
than [[young]] alcides when he did redeem
the virgin tribute paid by howling troy
to the sea-monster: i stand for [[sacrifice]];
the rest aloof are the dardanian wives [[wife]],
with bleared visages come forth to view
the issue of th’ exploit. go, hercules!
live thou, i [[live]]. with much much more dismay
i view the [[fight]] than thou that mak’st the fray.

 a [[song]], whilst bassanio comments on the caskets to himself.

     _tell me where is fancy bred,
     or in the [[heart]] or in the head?
     how begot, how nourished?
        reply, reply.
     it is engend’red in the [[eyes]],
     with gazing fed, and fancy dies
     in the cradle where it lies [[lie]].
        let us all ring fancy’s knell:
        i’ll begin it.—ding, dong, bell._

all.
     _ding, dong, bell._

bassanio.
so may the outward shows be least themselves.
the [[world]] is still deceiv’d with ornament.
in [[law]], what plea so tainted and corrupt
but, being season’d with a gracious voice,
obscures the show of [[evil]]? in [[religion]],
what damned error but some sober brow
will bless it, and approve it with a text,
hiding the grossness with [[fair]] ornament?
there is no [[vice]] so simple but assumes
some mark of [[virtue]] on his outward parts.
how many cowards, whose hearts [[heart]] are all as false
as stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
the beards of hercules and frowning [[mars]],
who inward search’d, have livers [[white]] as milk,
and these assume but valour’s excrement
to render them redoubted. look on [[beauty]],
and you shall see ’tis purchas’d by the weight,
which therein works [[work]] a miracle in [[nature]],
making them lightest that wear most of it:
so are those crisped snaky golden locks
which make such wanton gambols with the wind
upon supposed fairness, often known
to be the dowry of a second head,
the skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
thus ornament is but the guiled shore
to a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
veiling an [[indian]] [[beauty]]; in a word,
the seeming [[truth]] which cunning times [[time]] put on
to entrap the wisest. therefore thou gaudy gold,
hard food for midas, i will none of thee,
nor none of thee, thou pale and [[common]] drudge
’tween [[man]] and [[man]]: but thou, thou meagre lead,
which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught,
thy palenness moves me more than eloquence,
and here choose i, joy be the consequence!

portia.
[_aside._] how all the other [[passions]] fleet to air,
as doubtful thoughts [[thought]], and rash-embrac’d despair,
and shudd’ring [[fear]], and green-ey’d [[jealousy]].
o [[love]], be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,
in measure rain thy joy; scant this excess!
i [[feel]] too much thy blessing, make it less,
for [[fear]] i surfeit.

bassanio.
what find i here? [_opening the leaden casket_.]
fair portia’s counterfeit! what demi-god
hath come so near creation? move these [[eyes]]?
or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
seem they in motion? here are sever’d lips,
parted with sugar breath, so sweet a bar
should sunder such sweet [[friends]]. here in her hairs
the painter plays the spider, and hath woven
a golden mesh t’entrap the hearts [[heart]] of men
faster than gnats in cobwebs. but her eyes!—
how could he see to do them? having made one,
methinks it should have [[power]] to steal both his
and leave itself unfurnish’d. yet look how far
the substance of my [[praise]] doth [[wrong]] this shadow
in underprizing it, so far this shadow
doth limp behind the substance. here’s the scroll,
the continent and summary of my [[fortune]].

     _you that choose not by the view
     [[chance]] as [[fair]] and choose as true!
     since this [[fortune]] falls to you,
     be content and seek no new.
     if you be well pleas’d with this,
     and hold your [[fortune]] for your bliss,
     turn to where your [[lady]] is,
     and claim her with a loving kiss._

a gentle scroll. [[fair]] [[lady]], by your leave, [_kissing her_.]
i come by note to give and to receive.
like one of two contending in a prize
that thinks [[think]] he hath done well in people’s [[eyes]],
hearing applause and universal shout,
giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
whether those peals of [[praise]] be his or no,
so, thrice-fair [[lady]], stand i even so,
as doubtful whether what i see be true,
until confirm’d, sign’d, ratified by you.

portia.
you see me, [[lord]] bassanio, where i stand,
such as i am; though for myself alone
i would not be ambitious in my wish
to [[wish]] myself much [[better]], yet for you
i would be trebled twenty times [[time]] myself,
a thousand times [[time]] more [[fair]], ten thousand times
more [[rich]],
that only to stand high in your account,
i might in virtues [[virtue]], beauties [[beauty]], livings, [[friends]],
exceed account. but the full sum of me
is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
is an unlesson’d girl, unschool’d, unpractis’d;
happy in this, she is not yet so old
but she may learn; happier than this,
she is not bred so dull but she can learn;
happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit
commits itself to yours to be directed,
as from her [[lord]], her governor, her [[king]].
myself, and what is mine, to you and yours
is now converted. but now i was the lord
of this [[fair]] mansion, master of my servants,
queen o’er myself; and even now, but now,
this house, these servants, and this same myself
are yours,—my lord’s. i give them with this ring,
which when you part from, lose, or give away,
let it presage the ruin of your [[love]],
and be my vantage to exclaim on you.

bassanio.
madam, you have bereft me of all words,
only my [[blood]] speaks to you in my veins,
and there is such confusion in my powers
as after some oration fairly spoke
by a beloved [[prince]], there doth appear
among the buzzing pleased multitude,
where every something being blent together,
turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy
express’d and not express’d. but when this ring
parts from this finger, then parts [[life]] from hence.
o then be bold to say bassanio’s dead!

nerissa.
my [[lord]] and [[lady]], it is now our [[time]],
that have stood by and seen our wishes [[wish]] [[prosper]],
to cry, [[good]] joy. [[good]] joy, my [[lord]] and lady!

gratiano.
my [[lord]] bassanio, and my gentle [[lady]],
i [[wish]] you all the joy that you can [[wish]];
for i am sure you can [[wish]] none from me.
and when your honours [[honour]] mean to solemnize
the bargain of your [[faith]], i do beseech you
even at that [[time]] i may be [[married]] too.

bassanio.
with all my [[heart]], so thou canst get a [[wife]].

gratiano.
i thank your lordship, you have got me one.
my [[eyes]], my [[lord]], can look as swift as yours:
you saw the mistress, i beheld the maid.
you lov’d, i lov’d; for intermission
no more pertains to me, my [[lord]], than you.
your [[fortune]] stood upon the caskets there,
and so did mine too, as the matter falls.
for wooing here until i sweat again,
and swearing till my very roof was dry
with oaths of [[love]], at [[last]], (if promise last)
i got a promise of this [[fair]] one here
to have her [[love]], provided that your fortune
achiev’d her mistress.

portia.
is this true, nerissa?

nerissa.
madam, it is, so you stand pleas’d withal.

bassanio.
and do you, gratiano, mean [[good]] [[faith]]?

gratiano.
yes, [[faith]], my [[lord]].

bassanio.
our feast shall be much honoured in your [[marriage]].

gratiano.
we’ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.

nerissa.
what! and stake down?

gratiano.
no, we shall ne’er [[win]] at that [[sport]] and stake down.
but who comes here? lorenzo and his infidel?
what, and my old venetian friend, salerio!

 enter lorenzo, jessica and salerio.

bassanio.
lorenzo and salerio, welcome hither,
if that the [[youth]] of my new int’rest here
have [[power]] to bid you welcome. by your leave,
i bid my very [[friends]] and countrymen,
sweet portia, welcome.

portia.
so do i, my [[lord]],
they are entirely welcome.

lorenzo.
i thank your [[honour]]. for my part, my [[lord]],
my [[purpose]] was not to have seen you here,
but meeting with salerio by the way,
he did entreat me, [[past]] all saying nay,
to come with him along.

salerio.
i did, my [[lord]],
and i have [[reason]] for it. signior antonio
commends him to you.

 [_gives bassanio a letter._]

bassanio.
ere i ope his letter,
i [[pray]] you tell me how my [[good]] friend doth.

salerio.
not sick, my [[lord]], unless it be in [[mind]],
nor well, unless in [[mind]]. his letter there
will show you his estate.

 [_bassanio opens the letter._]

gratiano.
nerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome.
your hand, salerio. what’s the news from venice?
how doth that [[royal]] merchant, [[good]] antonio?
i [[know]] he will be glad of our [[success]].
we are the jasons, we have won the fleece.

salerio.
i would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.

portia.
there are some shrewd contents in yond same paper
that steals the colour from bassanio’s cheek.
some dear friend [[dead]], else nothing in the world
could turn so much the constitution
of any constant [[man]]. what, worse and worse?
with leave, bassanio, i am half yourself,
and i must freely have the half of anything
that this same paper brings you.

bassanio.
o sweet portia,
here are a few of the unpleasant’st words
that ever blotted paper. gentle [[lady]],
when i did first impart my [[love]] to you,
i freely told you all the [[wealth]] i had
ran in my veins, i was a gentleman.
and then i told you true. and yet, dear [[lady]],
rating myself at nothing, you shall see
how much i was a braggart. when i told you
my [[state]] was nothing, i should then have told you
that i was worse than nothing; for indeed
i have engag’d myself to a dear friend,
engag’d my friend to his mere [[enemy]],
to feed my means. here is a letter, [[lady]],
the paper as the [[body]] of my friend,
and every word in it a gaping wound
issuing life-blood. but is it true, salerio?
hath all his ventures fail’d? what, not one hit?
from tripolis, from mexico, and [[england]],
from lisbon, barbary, and [[india]],
and not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
of merchant-marring rocks?

salerio.
not one, my [[lord]].
besides, it should appear, that if he had
the [[present]] [[money]] to discharge the jew,
he would not take it. never did i know
a creature that did bear the shape of man
so keen and greedy to confound a [[man]].
he plies the duke at morning and at night,
and doth impeach the [[freedom]] of the state
if they deny him [[justice]]. twenty merchants,
the duke himself, and the magnificoes
of [[greatest]] port have all persuaded with him,
but none can drive him from the envious plea
of forfeiture, of [[justice]], and his bond.

jessica.
when i was with him, i have heard him swear
to tubal and to chus, his countrymen,
that he would rather have antonio’s flesh
than twenty times [[time]] the value of the sum
that he did owe him. and i [[know]], my [[lord]],
if [[law]], [[authority]], and [[power]] deny not,
it will go hard with [[poor]] antonio.

portia.
is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?

bassanio.
the dearest friend to me, the kindest [[man]],
the [[best]] condition’d and unwearied spirit
in doing courtesies, and one in whom
the ancient roman [[honour]] more appears
than any that draws breath in [[italy]].

portia.
what sum owes he the jew?

bassanio.
for me three thousand ducats.

portia.
what, no more?
pay him six thousand, and deface the bond.
double six thousand, and then treble that,
before a friend of this description
shall lose a hair through bassanio’s [[fault]].
first go with me to [[church]] and call me [[wife]],
and then away to venice to your friend.
for never shall you [[lie]] by portia’s side
with an unquiet [[soul]]. you shall have gold
to [[pay]] the petty debt twenty times [[time]] over.
when it is paid, bring your true friend along.
my maid nerissa and myself meantime,
will [[live]] as maids and widows. come, away!
for you shall hence upon your wedding day.
bid your [[friends]] welcome, show a merry cheer;
since you are dear bought, i will [[love]] you dear.
but let me hear the letter of your friend.

bassanio.
_sweet bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel,
my estate is very low, my bond to the jew is forfeit, and since in
paying it, it is impossible i should [[live]], all debts are clear’d
between you and i, if i might but see you at my [[death]]. notwithstanding,
use your [[pleasure]]. if your [[love]] do not persuade you to come, let not my
letter._

portia.
o [[love]], dispatch all [[business]] and be gone!

bassanio.
since i have your [[good]] leave to go away,
i will make haste; but, till i come again,
no bed shall e’er be guilty of my stay,
nor rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. venice. a street.

 enter shylock, salarino, antonio and gaoler.

shylock.
gaoler, look to him. tell not me of [[mercy]].
this is the [[fool]] that lent out [[money]] gratis.
gaoler, look to him.

antonio.
hear me yet, [[good]] shylock.

shylock.
i’ll have my bond, speak not against my bond.
i have sworn an oath that i will have my bond.
thou call’dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,
but since i am a dog, beware my fangs;
the duke shall grant me [[justice]]. i do wonder,
thou naughty gaoler, that thou art [[arts]] so fond
to come abroad with him at his request.

antonio.
i [[pray]] thee hear me speak.

shylock.
i’ll have my bond. i will not hear thee speak.
i’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.
i’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed [[fool]],
to shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
to [[christian]] intercessors. [[follow]] not,
i’ll have no speaking, i will have my bond.

 [_exit._]

salarino.
it is the most impenetrable cur
that ever kept with [[men]].

antonio.
let him alone.
i’ll [[follow]] him no more with bootless prayers.
he seeks my [[life]], his [[reason]] well i [[know]]:
i oft deliver’d from his forfeitures
many that have at times [[time]] made moan to me.
therefore he hates me.

salarino.
i am sure the duke
will never grant this forfeiture to hold.

antonio.
the duke cannot deny the course of [[law]],
for the commodity that strangers have
with us in venice, if it be denied,
’twill much impeach the [[justice]] of the [[state]],
since that the [[trade]] and [[profit]] of the city
consisteth of all nations. therefore, go.
these griefs and losses have so bated me
that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
tomorrow to my bloody creditor.
well, gaoler, on, [[pray]] [[god]] bassanio come
to see me [[pay]] his debt, and then i [[care]] not.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iv. belmont. a room in portia’s house.

 enter portia, nerissa, lorenzo, jessica and balthazar.

lorenzo.
madam, although i speak it in your presence,
you have a [[noble]] and a true conceit
of godlike amity, which appears most strongly
in bearing thus the absence of your [[lord]].
but if you knew to whom you show this [[honour]],
how true a gentleman you send relief,
how dear a lover of my [[lord]] your husband,
i [[know]] you would be prouder of the work
than customary bounty can enforce you.

portia.
i never did repent for doing [[good]],
nor shall not now; for in companions
that do converse and waste the [[time]] together,
whose souls [[soul]] do bear an [[equal]] yoke of [[love]],
there must be needs a like proportion
of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;
which makes me [[think]] that this antonio,
being the bosom lover of my [[lord]],
must needs be like my [[lord]]. if it be so,
how little is the cost i have bestowed
in purchasing the semblance of my soul
from out the [[state]] of hellish cruelty!
this comes too near the praising of myself;
therefore no more of it. hear other things.
lorenzo, i commit into your hands
the husbandry and manage of my house
until my lord’s return. for mine own part,
i have toward [[heaven]] breath’d a secret vow
to [[live]] in prayer and contemplation,
only attended by nerissa here,
until her husband and my lord’s return.
there is a monastery two miles off,
and there we will abide. i do [[desire]] you
not to deny this imposition,
the which my [[love]] and some necessity
now lays upon you.

lorenzo.
madam, with all my heart
i shall obey you in all [[fair]] commands.

portia.
my [[people]] do already [[know]] my [[mind]],
and will acknowledge you and jessica
in place of [[lord]] bassanio and myself.
so fare you well till we shall meet again.

lorenzo.
fair thoughts [[thought]] and [[happy]] hours attend on you!

jessica.
i [[wish]] your ladyship all heart’s content.

portia.
i thank you for your [[wish]], and am well pleas’d
to [[wish]] it back on you. fare you well, jessica.

 [_exeunt jessica and lorenzo._]

now, balthazar,
as i have ever found thee honest-true,
so let me find thee still. take this same letter,
and use thou all th’ endeavour of a man
in speed to padua, see thou render this
into my cousin’s hands, doctor bellario;
and look what notes and garments he doth give thee,
bring them, i [[pray]] thee, with imagin’d speed
unto the traject, to the [[common]] ferry
which trades [[trade]] to venice. waste no [[time]] in words,
but get thee gone. i shall be there before thee.

balthazar.
madam, i go with all convenient speed.

 [_exit._]

portia.
come on, nerissa, i have [[work]] in hand
that you yet [[know]] not of; we’ll see our husbands
before they [[think]] of us.

nerissa.
shall they see us?

portia.
they shall, nerissa, but in such a habit
that they shall [[think]] we are accomplished
with that we lack. i’ll hold thee any wager,
when we are both accoutered like [[young]] [[men]],
i’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
and wear my dagger with the braver grace,
and speak between the [[change]] of [[man]] and boy
with a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps
into a manly stride; and speak of frays
like a fine bragging [[youth]]; and tell quaint lies
how honourable ladies [[lady]] sought my [[love]],
which i denying, they fell sick and died;
i could not do withal. then i’ll repent,
and [[wish]] for all that, that i had not kill’d them.
and twenty of these puny lies [[lie]] i’ll tell,
that [[men]] shall swear i have discontinued school
about a twelvemonth. i have within my mind
a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks,
which i will practise.

nerissa.
why, shall we turn to [[men]]?

portia.
fie, what a question’s that,
if thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
but come, i’ll tell thee all my whole device
when i am in my coach, which stays for us
at the park gate; and therefore haste away,
for we must measure twenty miles today.

 [_exeunt._]

scene v. the same. a garden.

 enter launcelet and jessica.

launcelet.
yes, truly, for look you, the sins [[sin]] of the [[father]] are to be laid upon
the [[children]], therefore, i promise you, i [[fear]] you. i was always plain
with you, and so now i speak my agitation of the matter. therefore be
of [[good]] cheer, for truly i [[think]] you are damn’d. there is but one hope
in it that can do you any [[good]], and that is but a [[kind]] of bastard hope
neither.

jessica.
and what [[hope]] is that, i [[pray]] thee?

launcelet.
marry, you may partly [[hope]] that your [[father]] got you not, that you are
not the jew’s [[daughter]].

jessica.
that were a [[kind]] of bastard [[hope]] indeed; so the sins [[sin]] of my mother
should be visited upon me.

launcelet.
truly then i [[fear]] you are damn’d both by [[father]] and [[mother]]; thus when i
shun scylla your [[father]], i fall into charybdis your [[mother]]. well, you
are gone both ways.

jessica.
i shall be saved by my husband. he hath made me a [[christian]].

launcelet.
truly the more to blame he, we were christians [[christian]] enow before, e’en as
many as could well [[live]] one by another. this making of christians [[christian]] will
raise the price of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not
shortly have a rasher on the coals for [[money]].

 enter lorenzo.

jessica.
i’ll tell my husband, launcelet, what you say. here he comes.

lorenzo.
i shall grow [[jealous]] of you shortly, launcelet, if you thus get my wife
into corners!

jessica.
nay, you need nor [[fear]] us, lorenzo. launcelet and i are out. he tells
me flatly there’s no [[mercy]] for me in [[heaven]], because i am a jew’s
daughter; and he says you are no [[good]] member of the commonwealth, for
in converting [[jews]] to christians [[christian]] you raise the price of pork.

lorenzo.
i shall [[answer]] that [[better]] to the commonwealth than you can the getting
up of the negro’s belly! the moor is with child by you, launcelet.

launcelet.
it is much that the moor should be more than [[reason]]; but if she be less
than an honest woman, she is indeed more than i took her for.

lorenzo.
how every [[fool]] can play upon the word! i [[think]] the [[best]] grace of wit
will shortly turn into [[silence]], and discourse grow commendable in none
only but parrots. go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.

launcelet.
that is done, sir, they have all stomachs.

lorenzo.
goodly [[lord]], what a wit-snapper are you! then bid them prepare dinner.

launcelet.
that is done too, sir, only “cover” is the word.

lorenzo.
will you cover, then, sir?

launcelet.
not so, sir, neither. i [[know]] my [[duty]].

lorenzo.
yet more quarrelling with occasion! wilt thou show the whole [[wealth]] of
thy wit in an instant? i [[pray]] thee [[understand]] a plain [[man]] in his plain
meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the
meat, and we will come in to dinner.

launcelet.
for the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall
be covered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as
humours and conceits shall govern.

 [_exit._]

lorenzo.
o dear discretion, how his words are suited!
the [[fool]] hath planted in his memory
an [[army]] of [[good]] words, and i do know
a many fools [[fool]] that stand in [[better]] place,
garnish’d like him, that for a tricksy word
defy the matter. how cheer’st thou, jessica?
and now, [[good]] sweet, say thy [[opinion]],
how dost thou like the [[lord]] bassanio’s [[wife]]?

jessica.
past all expressing. it is very meet
the [[lord]] bassanio [[live]] an upright [[life]],
for having such a blessing in his [[lady]],
he finds the joys of [[heaven]] here on [[earth]],
and if on [[earth]] he do not [[merit]] it,
in [[reason]] he should never come to [[heaven]].
why, if two gods should play some heavenly match,
and on the wager lay two earthly [[women]],
and portia one, there must be something else
pawn’d with the other, for the [[poor]] rude world
hath not her fellow.

lorenzo.
even such a husband
hast thou of me as she is for a [[wife]].

jessica.
nay, but ask my [[opinion]] too of that.

lorenzo.
i will anon. first let us go to dinner.

jessica.
nay, let me [[praise]] you while i have a stomach.

lorenzo.
no [[pray]] thee, let it serve for table-talk.
then howsome’er thou speak’st, ’mong other things
i shall digest it.

jessica.
well, i’ll set you forth.

 [_exeunt._]


act iv

scene i. venice. a court of [[justice]].

 enter the duke, the magnificoes, antonio, bassanio, gratiano, salerio
 and others.

duke.
what, is antonio here?

antonio.
ready, so please your grace.

duke.
i am [[sorry]] for thee, thou art [[arts]] come to answer
a stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,
uncapable of [[pity]], void and empty
from any dram of [[mercy]].

antonio.
i have heard
your grace hath ta’en [[great]] pains [[pain]] to qualify
his rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,
and that no lawful means can carry me
out of his envy’s reach, i do oppose
my patience to his fury, and am arm’d
to suffer with a quietness of spirit
the very [[tyranny]] and rage of his.

duke.
go one and call the jew into the court.

salarino.
he is ready at the door. he comes, my [[lord]].

 enter shylock.

duke.
make room, and let him stand before our face.
shylock, the [[world]] thinks [[think]], and i [[think]] so too,
that thou but leadest this [[fashion]] of thy malice
to the [[last]] hour of act, and then, ’tis [[thought]],
thou’lt show thy [[mercy]] and remorse more strange
than is thy [[strange]] apparent [[cruelty]];
and where thou now exacts the penalty,
which is a pound of this [[poor]] merchant’s flesh,
thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
but, touch’d with [[human]] gentleness and [[love]],
forgive a moiety of the principal,
glancing an eye of [[pity]] on his losses
that have of late so huddled on his back,
enow to press a [[royal]] merchant down,
and pluck commiseration of his state
from brassy bosoms and rough hearts [[heart]] of flint,
from stubborn turks and tartars never train’d
to offices of tender courtesy.
we all expect a gentle [[answer]], jew.

shylock.
i have possess’d your grace of what i [[purpose]],
and by our holy [[sabbath]] have i sworn
to have the due and forfeit of my bond.
if you deny it, let the danger light
upon your charter and your city’s freedom!
you’ll ask me why i rather choose to have
a weight of carrion flesh than to receive
three thousand ducats. i’ll not [[answer]] that,
but say it is my [[humour]]. is it answer’d?
what if my house be troubled with a rat,
and i be pleas’d to give ten thousand ducats
to have it ban’d? what, are you answer’d yet?
some [[men]] there are [[love]] not a gaping pig;
some that are mad if they behold a cat;
and others, when the bagpipe sings i’ the nose,
cannot contain their urine; for affection
mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
of what it likes or loathes. now, for your [[answer]]:
as there is no firm [[reason]] to be render’d
why he cannot abide a gaping pig,
why he a harmless necessary cat,
why he a woollen bagpipe, but of force
must yield to such inevitable shame
as to offend, himself being offended,
so can i give no [[reason]], nor i will not,
more than a lodg’d hate and a [[certain]] loathing
i bear antonio, that i [[follow]] thus
a losing suit against him. are you answered?

bassanio.
this is no [[answer]], thou unfeeling [[man]],
to excuse the current of thy [[cruelty]].

shylock.
i am not bound to please thee with my [[answer]].

bassanio.
do all [[men]] kill the things they do not [[love]]?

shylock.
hates any [[man]] the thing he would not kill?

bassanio.
every offence is not a hate at first.

shylock.
what, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?

antonio.
i [[pray]] you, [[think]] you [[question]] with the jew.
you may as well go stand upon the beach
and bid the main flood bate his usual height;
you may as well use [[question]] with the wolf,
why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
you may as well forbid the mountain pines
to wag their high tops and to make no noise
when they are fretten with the gusts of [[heaven]];
you may as well do anything most hard
as seek to soften that—than which what’s harder?—
his jewish [[heart]]. therefore, i do beseech you,
make no moe offers, use no farther means,
but with all brief and plain conveniency.
let me have [[judgment]], and the jew his will.

bassanio.
for thy three thousand ducats here is six.

shylock.
if every ducat in six thousand ducats
were in six parts, and every part a ducat,
i would not draw them, i would have my bond.

duke.
how shalt thou [[hope]] for [[mercy]], rend’ring none?

shylock.
what [[judgment]] shall i dread, doing no [[wrong]]?
you have among you many a purchas’d [[slave]],
which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
you use in abject and in slavish parts,
because you bought them. shall i say to you
“let them be [[free]], [[marry]] them to your heirs?
why sweat they under burdens? let their beds
be made as soft as yours, and let their palates
be season’d with such viands”? you will answer
“the slaves [[slave]] are ours.” so do i [[answer]] you:
the pound of flesh which i demand of him
is dearly bought; ’tis mine and i will have it.
if you deny me, fie upon your law!
there is no [[force]] in the decrees of venice.
i stand for [[judgment]]. [[answer]]; shall i have it?

duke.
upon my [[power]] i may dismiss this court,
unless bellario, a learned doctor,
whom i have sent for to determine this,
come here today.

salarino.
my [[lord]], here stays without
a messenger with letters from the doctor,
new come from padua.

duke.
bring us the letters. call the messenger.

bassanio.
good cheer, antonio! what, [[man]], [[courage]] yet!
the jew shall have my flesh, [[blood]], bones, and all,
ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of [[blood]].

antonio.
i am a tainted wether of the flock,
meetest for [[death]], the weakest [[kind]] of fruit
drops earliest to the ground, and so let me.
you cannot [[better]] be employ’d, bassanio,
than to [[live]] still, and write mine epitaph.

 enter nerissa dressed like a lawyer’s clerk.

duke.
came you from padua, from bellario?

nerissa.
from both, my [[lord]]. bellario greets your grace.

 [_presents a letter._]

bassanio.
why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?

shylock.
to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.

gratiano.
not on thy sole but on thy [[soul]], harsh jew,
thou mak’st thy knife keen. but no metal can,
no, not the hangman’s axe, bear half the keenness
of thy sharp envy. can no prayers pierce thee?

shylock.
no, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

gratiano.
o, be thou damn’d, inexecrable dog!
and for thy [[life]] let [[justice]] be accus’d;
thou almost mak’st me waver in my [[faith]],
to hold [[opinion]] with pythagoras
that souls [[soul]] of animals infuse themselves
into the trunks of [[men]]. thy currish spirit
govern’d a wolf who, hang’d for [[human]] slaughter,
even from the gallows did his fell [[soul]] fleet,
and whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,
infus’d itself in thee; for thy desires
are wolfish, bloody, starv’d and ravenous.

shylock.
till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud.
repair thy wit, [[good]] [[youth]], or it will fall
to cureless ruin. i stand here for [[law]].

duke.
this letter from bellario doth commend
a [[young]] and learned doctor to our court.
where is he?

nerissa.
he attendeth here hard by,
to [[know]] your [[answer]], whether you’ll admit him.

duke of venice.
with all my [[heart]]: some three or four of you
go give him courteous conduct to this place.
meantime, the court shall hear bellario’s letter.

[_reads._] _your grace shall [[understand]] that at the receipt of your
letter i am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in
loving visitation was with me a [[young]] doctor of [[rome]]. his name is
balthazar. i acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the
jew and antonio the merchant. we turn’d o’er many books [[book]] together. he is
furnished with my [[opinion]], which, bettered with his own learning (the
greatness whereof i cannot enough commend), comes with him at my
importunity to fill up your grace’s request in my stead. i beseech you
let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
estimation, for i never knew so [[young]] a [[body]] with so old a head. i
leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose [[trial]] shall [[better]] publish
his commendation._

you hear the learn’d bellario what he writes,
and here, i take it, is the doctor come.

 enter portia dressed like a doctor of laws [[law]].

give me your hand. come you from old bellario?

portia.
i did, my [[lord]].

duke.
you are welcome. take your place.
are you acquainted with the difference
that holds this [[present]] [[question]] in the court?

portia.
i am informed throughly of the cause.
which is the merchant here? and which the jew?

duke.
antonio and old shylock, both stand forth.

portia.
is your name shylock?

shylock.
shylock is my name.

portia.
of a [[strange]] [[nature]] is the suit you [[follow]],
yet in such [[rule]] that the venetian law
cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
[_to antonio_.] you stand within his danger, do you not?

antonio.
ay, so he says.

portia.
do you confess the bond?

antonio.
i do.

portia.
then must the jew be merciful.

shylock.
on what compulsion must i? tell me that.

portia.
the quality of [[mercy]] is not strain’d,
it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath. it is twice blest,
it blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
’tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
the throned monarch [[better]] than his [[crown]].
his sceptre shows the [[force]] of temporal [[power]],
the attribute to awe and majesty,
wherein doth sit the dread and [[fear]] of kings [[king]];
but [[mercy]] is above this sceptred sway,
it is enthroned in the hearts [[heart]] of kings [[king]],
it is an attribute to [[god]] himself;
and earthly [[power]] doth then show likest god’s
when [[mercy]] seasons [[justice]]. therefore, jew,
though [[justice]] be thy plea, consider this,
that in the course of [[justice]] none of us
should see salvation. we do [[pray]] for [[mercy]],
and that same prayer doth [[teach]] us all to render
the deeds of [[mercy]]. i have spoke thus much
to mitigate the [[justice]] of thy plea,
which if thou [[follow]], this strict court of venice
must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant there.

shylock.
my deeds upon my head! i crave the [[law]],
the penalty and forfeit of my bond.

portia.
is he not able to discharge the [[money]]?

bassanio.
yes, here i tender it for him in the court,
yea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice,
i will be bound to [[pay]] it ten times [[time]] o’er
on forfeit of my hands, my head, my [[heart]].
if this will not suffice, it must appear
that malice bears down [[truth]]. and i beseech you,
wrest once the [[law]] to your [[authority]].
to do a [[great]] [[right]], do a little [[wrong]],
and curb this cruel [[devil]] of his will.

portia.
it must not be, there is no [[power]] in venice
can alter a decree established;
’twill be recorded for a precedent,
and many an error by the same example
will rush into the [[state]]. it cannot be.

shylock.
a daniel come to judgment! yea, a daniel!
o [[wise]] [[young]] [[judge]], how i do [[honour]] thee!

portia.
i [[pray]] you let me look upon the bond.

shylock.
here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.

portia.
shylock, there’s thrice thy [[money]] offered thee.

shylock.
an oath, an oath! i have an oath in [[heaven]].
shall i lay perjury upon my [[soul]]?
no, not for venice.

portia.
why, this bond is forfeit,
and lawfully by this the jew may claim
a pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
nearest the merchant’s [[heart]]. be merciful,
take thrice thy [[money]]; bid me tear the bond.

shylock.
when it is paid according to the tenour.
it doth appear you are a worthy [[judge]];
you [[know]] the [[law]]; your exposition
hath been most sound. i charge you by the [[law]],
whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
proceed to [[judgment]]. by my [[soul]] i swear
there is no [[power]] in the tongue of man
to alter me. i stay here on my bond.

antonio.
most heartily i do beseech the court
to give the [[judgment]].

portia.
why then, thus it is:
you must prepare your bosom for his knife.

shylock.
o [[noble]] judge! o excellent [[young]] man!

portia.
for the intent and [[purpose]] of the law
hath full relation to the penalty,
which here appeareth due upon the bond.

shylock.
’tis very true. o [[wise]] and upright [[judge]],
how much more elder art [[arts]] thou than thy looks!

portia.
therefore lay bare your bosom.

shylock.
ay, his breast
so says the bond, doth it not, [[noble]] [[judge]]?
“nearest his heart”: those are the very words.

portia.
it is so. are there balance here to weigh
the flesh?

shylock.
i have them ready.

portia.
have by some surgeon, shylock, on your charge,
to stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to [[death]].

shylock.
is it so nominated in the bond?

portia.
it is not so express’d, but what of that?
’twere [[good]] you do so much for charity.

shylock.
i cannot find it; ’tis not in the bond.

portia.
you, merchant, have you anything to say?

antonio.
but little. i am arm’d and well prepar’d.
give me your hand, bassanio. fare you well,
grieve not that i am fallen to this for you,
for herein [[fortune]] shows herself more kind
than is her custom: it is still her use
to let the wretched [[man]] outlive his [[wealth]],
to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
an [[age]] of [[poverty]], from which ling’ring penance
of such misery doth she cut me off.
commend me to your honourable [[wife]],
tell her the process of antonio’s end,
say how i lov’d you, speak me [[fair]] in [[death]].
and when the tale is told, bid her be judge
whether bassanio had not once a [[love]].
repent but you that you shall lose your friend
and he repents not that he pays [[pay]] your debt.
for if the jew do cut but deep enough,
i’ll [[pay]] it instantly with all my [[heart]].

bassanio.
antonio, i am [[married]] to a wife
which is as dear to me as [[life]] itself,
but [[life]] itself, my [[wife]], and all the [[world]],
are not with me esteem’d above thy [[life]].
i would lose all, ay, [[sacrifice]] them all
here to this [[devil]], to deliver you.

portia.
your [[wife]] would give you little thanks for that
if she were by to hear you make the offer.

gratiano.
i have a [[wife]] who i [[protest]] i [[love]].
i would she were in [[heaven]], so she could
entreat some [[power]] to [[change]] this currish jew.

nerissa.
’tis well you offer it behind her back,
the [[wish]] would make else an unquiet house.

shylock.
these be the [[christian]] husbands! i have a daughter—
would any of the stock of barabbas
had been her husband, rather than a christian!
we trifle [[time]], i [[pray]] thee, pursue sentence.

portia.
a pound of that same merchant’s flesh is thine,
the court awards it and the [[law]] doth give it.

shylock.
most rightful judge!

portia.
and you must cut this flesh from off his breast.
the [[law]] allows it and the court awards it.

shylock.
most learned judge! a sentence! come, prepare.

portia.
tarry a little, there is something else.
this bond doth give thee here no jot of [[blood]].
the words expressly are “a pound of flesh”:
take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,
but in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
one drop of [[christian]] [[blood]], thy lands [[land]] and goods
are, by the laws [[law]] of venice, confiscate
unto the [[state]] of venice.

gratiano.
o upright judge! mark, jew. o learned judge!

shylock.
is that the [[law]]?

portia.
thyself shalt see the act.
for, as thou urgest [[justice]], be assur’d
thou shalt have [[justice]] more than thou desir’st.

gratiano.
o learned judge! mark, jew, a learned judge!

shylock.
i take this offer then. [[pay]] the bond thrice
and let the [[christian]] go.

bassanio.
here is the [[money]].

portia.
soft!
the jew shall have all [[justice]]. soft! no haste!
he shall have nothing but the penalty.

gratiano.
o jew, an upright [[judge]], a learned judge!

portia.
therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
shed thou no [[blood]], nor cut thou less nor more,
but just a pound of flesh: if thou tak’st more
or less than a just pound, be it but so much
as makes it [[light]] or heavy in the substance,
or the division of the twentieth part
of one [[poor]] scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
but in the estimation of a hair,
thou diest, and all thy goods [[good]] are confiscate.

gratiano.
a second daniel, a daniel, jew!
now, infidel, i have you on the hip.

portia.
why doth the jew pause? take thy forfeiture.

shylock.
give me my principal, and let me go.

bassanio.
i have it ready for thee. here it is.

portia.
he hath refus’d it in the open court,
he shall have merely [[justice]] and his bond.

gratiano.
a daniel still say i, a second daniel!
i thank thee, jew, for teaching me that word.

shylock.
shall i not have barely my principal?

portia.
thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
to be so taken at thy peril, jew.

shylock.
why, then the [[devil]] give him [[good]] of it!
i’ll stay no longer [[question]].

portia.
tarry, jew.
the [[law]] hath yet another hold on you.
it is enacted in the laws [[law]] of venice,
if it be proved against an alien
that by direct or indirect attempts
he seek the [[life]] of any citizen,
the party ’gainst the which he doth contrive
shall seize one half his goods [[good]]; the other half
comes to the privy coffer of the [[state]],
and the offender’s [[life]] lies [[lie]] in the mercy
of the duke only, ’gainst all other voice.
in which predicament i say thou stand’st;
for it appears by manifest proceeding
that indirectly, and directly too,
thou hast contrived against the very life
of the defendant; and thou hast incurr’d
the danger formerly by me rehears’d.
down, therefore, and beg [[mercy]] of the duke.

gratiano.
beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself,
and yet, thy [[wealth]] being forfeit to the [[state]],
thou hast not left the value of a cord;
therefore thou must be hang’d at the state’s charge.

duke.
that thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,
i pardon thee thy [[life]] before thou ask it.
for half thy [[wealth]], it is antonio’s;
the other half comes to the general [[state]],
which humbleness may drive unto a fine.

portia.
ay, for the [[state]], not for antonio.

shylock.
nay, take my [[life]] and all, pardon not that.
you take my house when you do take the prop
that doth sustain my house; you take my life
when you do take the means whereby i [[live]].

portia.
what [[mercy]] can you render him, antonio?

gratiano.
a halter gratis, nothing else, for [[god’s]] sake!

antonio.
so please my [[lord]] the duke and all the court
to quit the fine for one half of his goods [[good]],
i am content, so he will let me have
the other half in use, to render it
upon his [[death]] unto the gentleman
that lately stole his [[daughter]].
two things provided more, that for this favour,
he presently become a [[christian]];
the other, that he do record a gift,
here in the court, of all he dies possess’d
unto his [[son]] lorenzo and his [[daughter]].

duke.
he shall do this, or else i do recant
the pardon that i late pronounced here.

portia.
art thou contented, jew? what dost thou say?

shylock.
i am content.

portia.
clerk, draw a deed of gift.

shylock.
i [[pray]] you give me leave to go from hence;
i am not well; send the deed after me
and i will sign it.

duke.
get thee gone, but do it.

gratiano.
in christ’ning shalt thou have two god-fathers.
had i been [[judge]], thou shouldst have had ten more,
to bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.

 [_exit shylock._]

duke.
sir, i entreat you [[home]] with me to dinner.

portia.
i humbly do [[desire]] your grace of pardon,
i must away this night toward padua,
and it is meet i presently set forth.

duke.
i am [[sorry]] that your leisure serves you not.
antonio, gratify this gentleman,
for in my [[mind]] you are much bound to him.

 [_exeunt duke and his train._]

bassanio.
most worthy gentleman, i and my friend
have by your [[wisdom]] been this day acquitted
of grievous penalties, in lieu whereof,
three thousand ducats due unto the jew
we freely cope your courteous pains [[pain]] withal.

antonio.
and stand indebted, over and above
in [[love]] and service to you evermore.

portia.
he is well paid that is well satisfied,
and i delivering you, am satisfied,
and therein do account myself well paid,
my [[mind]] was never yet more mercenary.
i [[pray]] you [[know]] me when we meet again,
i [[wish]] you well, and so i take my leave.

bassanio.
dear sir, of [[force]] i must attempt you further.
take some remembrance of us as a tribute,
not as fee. grant me two things, i [[pray]] you,
not to deny me, and to pardon me.

portia.
you press me far, and therefore i will yield.
[_to antonio_.] give me your gloves, i’ll wear them for your sake.
[_to bassanio_.] and, for your [[love]], i’ll take this ring from you.
do not draw back your hand; i’ll take no more,
and you in [[love]] shall not deny me this.

bassanio.
this ring, [[good]] sir? alas, it is a trifle,
i will not shame myself to give you this.

portia.
i will have nothing else but only this,
and now methinks i have a [[mind]] to it.

bassanio.
there’s more depends on this than on the value.
the dearest ring in venice will i give you,
and find it out by proclamation,
only for this i [[pray]] you pardon me.

portia.
i see, sir, you are liberal in offers.
you taught me first to beg, and now methinks
you [[teach]] me how a beggar should be answer’d.

bassanio.
good sir, this ring was given me by my [[wife]],
and when she put it on, she made me vow
that i should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it.

portia.
that ’scuse serves many [[men]] to save their gifts.
and if your [[wife]] be not a mad-woman,
and [[know]] how well i have deserv’d this ring,
she would not hold out [[enemy]] for ever
for giving it to me. well, [[peace]] be with you!

 [_exeunt portia and nerissa._]

antonio.
my [[lord]] bassanio, let him have the ring.
let his deservings and my [[love]] withal
be valued ’gainst your wife’s commandment.

bassanio.
go, gratiano, run and overtake him;
give him the ring, and bring him if thou canst
unto antonio’s house. away, make haste.

 [_exit gratiano._]

come, you and i will thither presently,
and in the morning early will we both
fly toward belmont. come, antonio.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. the same. a street.

 enter portia and nerissa.

portia.
inquire the jew’s house out, give him this deed,
and let him sign it, we’ll away tonight,
and be a day before our husbands [[home]].
this deed will be well welcome to lorenzo.

 enter gratiano.

gratiano.
fair sir, you are well o’erta’en.
my [[lord]] bassanio upon more [[advice]],
hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
your company at dinner.

portia.
that cannot be;
his ring i do accept most thankfully,
and so i [[pray]] you tell him. furthermore,
i [[pray]] you show my [[youth]] old shylock’s house.

gratiano.
that will i do.

nerissa.
sir, i would speak with you.
[_aside to portia_.]
i’ll see if i can get my husband’s ring,
which i did make him swear to keep for ever.

portia.
[_to nerissa_.] thou mayst, i warrant. we shall have old swearing
that they did give the rings away to [[men]];
but we’ll outface them, and outswear them too.
away! make haste! thou know’st where i will tarry.

nerissa.
come, [[good]] sir, will you show me to this house?

 [_exeunt._]


act v

scene i. belmont. the avenue to portia’s house.

 enter lorenzo and jessica.

lorenzo.
the moon shines bright. in such a night as this,
when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees,
and they did make no noise, in such a night,
troilus methinks mounted the trojan walls,
and sigh’d his [[soul]] toward the grecian tents
where cressid lay that night.

jessica.
in such a night
did thisby fearfully o’ertrip the dew,
and saw the lion’s shadow ere himself,
and ran dismay’d away.

lorenzo.
in such a night
stood dido with a willow in her hand
upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love
to come again to [[carthage]].

jessica.
in such a night
medea gathered the enchanted herbs
that did renew old æson.

lorenzo.
in such a night
did jessica steal from the wealthy jew,
and with an unthrift [[love]] did run from venice
as far as belmont.

jessica.
in such a night
did [[young]] lorenzo swear he loved her well,
stealing her [[soul]] with many vows of [[faith]],
and ne’er a true one.

lorenzo.
in such a night
did pretty jessica, like a little shrew,
slander her [[love]], and he forgave it her.

jessica.
i would out-night you did no [[body]] come;
but hark, i hear the footing of a [[man]].

 enter stephano.

lorenzo.
who comes so fast in [[silence]] of the night?

stephano.
a friend.

lorenzo.
a friend! what friend? your name, i [[pray]] you, friend?

stephano.
stephano is my name, and i bring word
my mistress will before the break of day
be here at belmont. she doth stray about
by holy crosses where she kneels and prays
for [[happy]] wedlock hours.

lorenzo.
who comes with her?

stephano.
none but a holy hermit and her maid.
i [[pray]] you is my master yet return’d?

lorenzo.
he is not, nor we have not heard from him.
but go we in, i [[pray]] thee, jessica,
and ceremoniously let us prepare
some welcome for the mistress of the house.

 enter launcelet.

launcelet. sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!

lorenzo.
who calls?

launcelet.
sola! did you see master lorenzo? master lorenzo! sola, sola!

lorenzo.
leave holloaing, [[man]]. here!

launcelet.
sola! where, where?

lorenzo.
here!

launcelet.
tell him there’s a post come from my master with his horn full of good
news. my master will be here ere morning.

 [_exit._]

lorenzo.
sweet [[soul]], let’s in, and there expect their coming.
and yet no matter; why should we go in?
my friend stephano, signify, i [[pray]] you,
within the house, your mistress is at hand,
and bring your [[music]] forth into the air.

 [_exit stephano._]

how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
here will we sit and let the sounds of music
creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night
become the touches of sweet harmony.
sit, jessica. look how the floor of heaven
is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold.
there’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st
but in his motion like an angel sings,
still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
such harmony is in [[immortal]] souls [[soul]],
but whilst this muddy vesture of decay
doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

 enter musicians.

come, ho! and wake diana with a hymn.
with sweetest touches pierce your mistress’ ear,
and draw her [[home]] with [[music]].

 [_music._]

jessica.
i am never merry when i hear sweet [[music]].

lorenzo.
the [[reason]] is, your spirits are attentive.
for do but note a wild and wanton herd
or [[race]] of youthful and unhandled colts,
fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
which is the hot condition of their [[blood]],
if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
or any air of [[music]] touch their ears,
you shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
their savage [[eyes]] turn’d to a modest gaze
by the sweet [[power]] of [[music]]: therefore the poet
did feign that orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods,
since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
but [[music]] for the [[time]] doth [[change]] his [[nature]].
the [[man]] that hath no [[music]] in himself,
nor is not mov’d with concord of sweet sounds,
is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
the motions of his spirit are dull as night,
and his affections dark as erebus.
let no such [[man]] be trusted. mark the [[music]].

 enter portia and nerissa.

portia.
that [[light]] we see is burning in my hall.
how far that little candle throws his beams!
so shines a [[good]] deed in a naughty [[world]].

nerissa.
when the moon shone we did not see the candle.

portia.
so doth the greater [[glory]] dim the less.
a substitute shines brightly as a king
until a [[king]] be by, and then his state
empties itself, as doth an inland brook
into the main of waters. music! hark!

nerissa.
it is your [[music]], madam, of the house.

portia.
nothing is [[good]], i see, without [[respect]].
methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.

nerissa.
silence bestows that [[virtue]] on it, madam.

portia.
the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
when neither is attended; and i think
the nightingale, if she should sing by day
when every goose is cackling, would be thought
no [[better]] a musician than the wren.
how many things by season season’d are
to their [[right]] [[praise]] and true perfection!
peace! how the moon sleeps with endymion,
and would not be awak’d!

 [_music ceases._]

lorenzo.
that is the voice,
or i am much deceiv’d, of portia.

portia.
he knows [[know]] me as the blind [[man]] knows [[know]] the cuckoo,
by the [[bad]] voice.

lorenzo.
dear [[lady]], welcome [[home]].

portia.
we have been praying for our husbands’ welfare,
which speed, we [[hope]], the [[better]] for our words.
are they return’d?

lorenzo.
madam, they are not yet;
but there is come a messenger before
to signify their coming.

portia.
go in, nerissa.
give order to my servants, that they take
no note at all of our being absent hence,
nor you, lorenzo; jessica, nor you.

 [_a tucket sounds._]

lorenzo.
your husband is at hand, i hear his trumpet.
we are no tell-tales, madam, [[fear]] you not.

portia.
this night methinks is but the daylight sick,
it looks a little paler. ’tis a day
such as the day is when the sun is hid.

 enter bassanio, antonio, gratiano and their followers.

bassanio.
we should hold day with the antipodes,
if you would walk in absence of the sun.

portia.
let me give [[light]], but let me not be [[light]],
for a [[light]] [[wife]] doth make a heavy husband,
and never be bassanio so for me.
but [[god]] sort all! you are welcome [[home]], my [[lord]].

bassanio.
i thank you, madam. give welcome to my friend.
this is the [[man]], this is antonio,
to whom i am so infinitely bound.

portia.
you should in all sense be much bound to him,
for, as i hear, he was much bound for you.

antonio.
no more than i am well acquitted of.

portia.
sir, you are very welcome to our house.
it must appear in other ways than words,
therefore i scant this breathing courtesy.

gratiano.
[_to nerissa_.] by yonder moon i swear you do me [[wrong]],
in [[faith]], i gave it to the judge’s clerk.
would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
since you do take it, [[love]], so much at [[heart]].

portia.
a quarrel, ho, already! what’s the matter?

gratiano.
about a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
that she did give me, whose posy was
for all the [[world]] like cutlers’ poetry
upon a knife, “love me, and leave me not.”

nerissa.
what talk you of the posy, or the value?
you swore to me when i did give it you,
that you would wear it till your hour of [[death]],
and that it should [[lie]] with you in your grave.
though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
you should have been respective and have kept it.
gave it a judge’s clerk! no, [[god’s]] my [[judge]],
the clerk will ne’er wear hair on’s face that had it.

gratiano.
he will, and if he [[live]] to be a [[man]].

nerissa.
ay, if a woman [[live]] to be a [[man]].

gratiano.
now, by this hand, i gave it to a [[youth]],
a [[kind]] of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
no higher than thyself, the judge’s clerk,
a prating boy that begg’d it as a fee,
i could not for my [[heart]] deny it him.

portia.
you were to blame,—i must be plain with you,—
to part so slightly with your wife’s first gift,
a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,
and so riveted with [[faith]] unto your flesh.
i gave my [[love]] a ring, and made him swear
never to part with it, and here he stands.
i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
that the [[world]] masters. now, in [[faith]], gratiano,
you give your [[wife]] too unkind a cause of [[grief]],
an ’twere to me i should be mad at it.

bassanio.
[_aside._] why, i were [[best]] to cut my left hand off,
and swear i lost the ring defending it.

gratiano.
my [[lord]] bassanio gave his ring away
unto the [[judge]] that begg’d it, and indeed
deserv’d it too. and then the boy, his clerk,
that took some pains [[pain]] in writing, he begg’d mine,
and neither [[man]] nor master would take aught
but the two rings.

portia.
what ring gave you, my [[lord]]?
not that, i [[hope]], which you receiv’d of me.

bassanio.
if i could add a [[lie]] unto a [[fault]],
i would deny it, but you see my finger
hath not the ring upon it, it is gone.

portia.
even so void is your false [[heart]] of [[truth]].
by [[heaven]], i will ne’er come in your bed
until i see the ring.

nerissa.
nor i in yours
till i again see mine!

bassanio.
sweet portia,
if you did [[know]] to whom i gave the ring,
if you did [[know]] for whom i gave the ring,
and would conceive for what i gave the ring,
and how unwillingly i left the ring,
when nought would be accepted but the ring,
you would abate the [[strength]] of your displeasure.

portia.
if you had known the [[virtue]] of the ring,
or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
or your own [[honour]] to contain the ring,
you would not then have parted with the ring.
what [[man]] is there so much unreasonable,
if you had pleas’d to have defended it
with any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
to urge the thing held as a [[ceremony]]?
nerissa teaches [[teach]] me what to [[believe]]:
i’ll [[die]] for’t but some woman had the ring.

bassanio.
no, by my [[honour]], madam, by my [[soul]],
no woman had it, but a civil doctor,
which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,
and begg’d the ring, the which i did deny him,
and suffer’d him to go displeas’d away,
even he that had held up the very life
of my dear friend. what should i say, sweet [[lady]]?
i was enforc’d to send it after him.
i was beset with shame and courtesy.
my [[honour]] would not let ingratitude
so much besmear it. pardon me, [[good]] [[lady]];
for by these blessed candles of the night,
had you been there, i [[think]] you would have begg’d
the ring of me to give the worthy doctor.

portia.
let not that doctor e’er come near my house,
since he hath got the jewel that i loved,
and that which you did swear to keep for me,
i will become as liberal as you,
i’ll not deny him anything i have,
no, not my [[body]], nor my husband’s bed.
know him i shall, i am well sure of it.
lie not a night from [[home]]. watch me like argus,
if you do not, if i be left alone,
now by mine [[honour]] which is yet mine own,
i’ll have that doctor for mine bedfellow.

nerissa.
and i his clerk. therefore be well advis’d
how you do leave me to mine own protection.

gratiano.
well, do you so. let not me take him then,
for if i do, i’ll mar the [[young]] clerk’s pen.

antonio.
i am th’ unhappy [[subject]] of these quarrels.

portia.
sir, grieve not you. you are welcome notwithstanding.

bassanio.
portia, [[forgive]] me this enforced [[wrong]],
and in the hearing of these many friends
i swear to thee, even by thine own [[fair]] [[eyes]],
wherein i see myself—

portia.
mark you but that!
in both my [[eyes]] he doubly sees himself,
in each eye one. swear by your double [[self]],
and there’s an oath of credit.

bassanio.
nay, but hear me.
pardon this [[fault]], and by my [[soul]] i swear
i never more will break an oath with thee.

antonio.
i once did lend my [[body]] for his [[wealth]],
which but for him that had your husband’s ring
had quite miscarried. i dare be bound again,
my [[soul]] upon the forfeit, that your lord
will never more break [[faith]] advisedly.

portia.
then you shall be his surety. give him this,
and bid him keep it [[better]] than the other.

antonio.
here, [[lord]] bassanio, swear to keep this ring.

bassanio.
by [[heaven]], it is the same i gave the doctor!

portia.
i had it of him: pardon me, bassanio,
for by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

nerissa.
and pardon me, my gentle gratiano,
for that same scrubbed boy, the doctor’s clerk,
in lieu of this, [[last]] night did [[lie]] with me.

gratiano.
why, this is like the mending of highways
in summer, where the ways are [[fair]] enough.
what, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv’d it?

portia.
speak not so grossly. you are all amaz’d.
here is a letter; [[read]] it at your leisure.
it comes from padua from bellario.
there you shall find that portia was the doctor,
nerissa there, her clerk. lorenzo here
shall witness i set forth as soon as you,
and even but now return’d. i have not yet
enter’d my house. antonio, you are welcome,
and i have [[better]] news in store for you
than you expect: unseal this letter soon.
there you shall find three of your argosies
are richly come to harbour suddenly.
you shall not [[know]] by what [[strange]] accident
i chanced on this letter.

antonio.
i am dumb.

bassanio.
were you the doctor, and i knew you not?

gratiano.
were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?

nerissa.
ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
unless he [[live]] until he be a [[man]].

bassanio.
sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.
when i am absent, then [[lie]] with my [[wife]].

antonio.
sweet [[lady]], you have given me [[life]] and living;
for here i [[read]] for [[certain]] that my ships
are safely come to road.

portia.
how now, lorenzo!
my clerk hath some [[good]] comforts too for you.

nerissa.
ay, and i’ll give them him without a fee.
there do i give to you and jessica,
from the [[rich]] jew, a special deed of gift,
after his [[death]], of all he dies possess’d of.

lorenzo.
fair ladies [[lady]], you drop manna in the way
of starved [[people]].

portia.
it is almost morning,
and yet i am sure you are not satisfied
of these events at full. let us go in,
and charge us there upon inter’gatories,
and we will [[answer]] all things faithfully.

gratiano.
let it be so. the first inter’gatory
that my nerissa shall be sworn on is,
whether till the next night she had rather stay,
or go to bed now, being two hours to day.
but were the day come, i should [[wish]] it dark
till i were couching with the doctor’s clerk.
well, while i [[live]], i’ll [[fear]] no other thing
so sore as keeping safe nerissa’s ring.

 [_exeunt._]
