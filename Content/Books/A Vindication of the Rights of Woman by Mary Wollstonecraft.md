a brief sketch of the [[life]] of [[mary]] wollstonecraft.

m. wollstonecraft was born in 1759.  her [[father]] was so [[great]] a
wanderer, that the place of her birth is uncertain; she supposed,
however, it was [[london]], or epping forest:  at the latter place she
spent the first five years of her [[life]].  in early [[youth]] she
exhibited traces of exquisite sensibility, soundness of
understanding, and decision of [[character]]; but her [[father]] being a
despot in his [[family]], and her [[mother]] one of his subjects [[subject]], [[mary]],
derived little benefit from their parental training.  she received
no literary instructions but such as were to be had in ordinary day
schools.  before her sixteenth year she became acquainted with mr.
clare a clergyman, and miss frances [[blood]]; the latter, two years
older than herself; who possessing [[good]] taste and some [[knowledge]] of
the fine [[arts]], seems to have given the first impulse to the
formation of her [[character]].  at the [[age]] of nineteen, she left her
parents, and resided with a mrs. dawson for two years; when she
returned to the parental roof to give attention to her [[mother]],
whose ill health made her presence necessary.  on the [[death]] of her
mother, [[mary]] bade a final adieu to her father's house, and became
the inmate of f. [[blood]]; thus situated, their intimacy increased,
and a [[strong]] attachment was reciprocated.  in 1783 she commenced a
day school at newington green, in conjunction with her friend, f.
blood.  at this place she became acquainted with dr. price, to whom
she became strongly attached; the regard was mutual.

it is said that she became a teacher from motives of benevolence,
or rather philanthropy, and during the [[time]] she continued in the
profession, she gave proof of superior qualification for the
performance of its arduous and important duties [[duty]].  her friend and
coadjutor [[married]] and removed to lisbon, in portugal, where she
died of a pulmonary disease; the symptoms of which were visible
before her [[marriage]].  so true was mary's attachment to her, that
she entrusted her school to the [[care]] of others, for the [[purpose]] of
attending frances in her closing scene.  she aided, as did dr.
young, in "stealing narcissa a grave."  her [[mind]] was expanded by
this residence in a [[foreign]] [[country]], and though clear of religious
bigotry before, she took some instructive lessons on the evils [[evil]] of
superstition, and intolerance.

on her return she found the school had [[suffered]] by her absence, and
having previously decided to apply herself to literature, she now
resolved to commence.  in 1787 she made, or received, proposals
from johnson, a publisher in [[london]], who was already acquainted
with her [[talents]] as an author.  during the three subsequent years,
she was actively engaged, more in translating, condensing, and
compiling, than in the production of original works [[work]].  at this time
she laboured under much depression of spirits, for the loss of her
friend; this rather increased, perhaps, by the publication of
"mary, a novel," which was mostly composed of incidents and
reflections connected with their intimacy.

the pecuniary concerns of her [[father]] becoming embarrassed, mary
practised a rigid economy in her expenditures, and with her savings
was enabled to procure her sisters and brothers [[brother]] situations, to
which without her aid, they could not have had access; her father
was sustained at length from her funds; she even found means to
take under her protection an orphan child.

she had acquired a facility in the arrangement and expression of
thoughts, in her avocation of translator, and compiler, which was
no [[doubt]] of [[great]] use to her afterward.  it was not long until she
had [[occasion]] for them.  the eminent burke produced his celebrated
"reflections on the [[revolution]] in [[france]]."  [[mary]] full of sentiments
of [[liberty]], and indignant at what she [[thought]] subversive of it,
seized her pen and produced the first attack upon that famous [[work]].
it succeeded well, for though intemperate and contemptuous, it was
vehemently and impetuously eloquent; and though burke was beloved
by the enlightened [[friends]] of [[freedom]], they were dissatisfied and
disgusted with what they deemed an outrage upon it.

it is said that [[mary]], had not wanted confidence in her own powers
before, but the reception this [[work]] met from the [[public]], gave her
an opportunity of judging what those powers [[power]] were, in the estimation
of others.  it was shortly after this, that she commenced the work
to which these remarks are prefixed.  what are its merits [[merit]] will be
decided in the [[judgment]] of each reader; suffice it to say she
appears to have stept forth boldly, and singly, in defence of that
half of the [[human]] [[race]], which by the usages of all [[society]], whether
savage or civilized, have been kept from attaining their proper
dignity--their [[equal]] rank as [[rational]] beings.  it would appear that
the [[disguise]] used in placing on woman the silken fetters which
bribed her into endurance, and even [[love]] of [[slavery]], but increased
the opposition of our authoress:  she would have had more patience
with rude, brute coercion, than with that imposing gallantry,
which, while it affects to consider woman as the [[pride]], and
ornament of creation, degrades her to a toy--an appendage--a
cypher.  the [[work]] was much reprehended, and as might well be
expected, found its [[greatest]] enemies [[enemy]] in the pretty soft
creatures--the spoiled [[children]] of her own [[sex]].  she accomplished
it in six weeks.

in 1792 she removed to [[paris]], where she became acquainted with
gilbert imlay, of the [[united]] states.  and from this acquaintance
grew an attachment, which brought the parties together, without
legal formalities, to which she objected on account of some family
embarrassments, in which he would thereby become involved.  the
engagement was however considered by her of the most [[sacred]] [[nature]],
and they formed the plan of emigrating to [[america]], where they
should be enabled to accomplish it.  these were the days of
robespierrean [[cruelty]], and imlay left [[paris]] for havre, whither
after a [[time]] [[mary]] followed him.  they continued to reside there,
until he left havre for [[london]], under pretence of [[business]], and
with a promise of rejoining her soon at [[paris]], which however he did
not, but in 1795 sent for her to [[london]].  in the mean [[time]] she had
become the [[mother]] of a female child, whom she called frances in
commemoration of her early [[friendship]].

before she went to [[england]], she had some gloomy forebodings that
the affections of imlay, had waned, if they were not estranged from
her; on her arrival, those forebodings were sorrowfully confirmed.
his attentions were too formal and constrained to pass unobserved
by her penetration, and though he ascribed his manner, and his
absence, to [[business]] duties [[duty]], she saw his affection for her was only
something to be remembered.  to use her own expression, "love, dear
delusion!  rigorous [[reason]] has forced me to resign; and now my
rational prospects are blasted, just as i have learned to be
contented with [[rational]] enjoyments."  to pretend to depict her
misery at this [[time]] would be futile; the [[best]] [[idea]] can be formed of
it from the [[fact]] that she had planned her own destruction, from
which imlay prevented her.  she conceived the [[idea]] of suicide a
second [[time]], and threw herself into the thames; she remained in the
water, until [[consciousness]] forsook her, but she was taken up and
resuscitated.  after divers attempts to revive the affections of
imlay, with sundry explanations and professions on his part,
through the lapse of two years, she resolved finally to forgo all
hope of reclaiming him, and endeavour to [[think]] of him no more in
connexion with her future prospects.  in this she succeeded so
well, that she afterwards had a private interview with him, which
did not [[produce]] any painful emotions.

in 1796 she revived or improved an acquaintance which commenced
years before with wm. godwin, author of "political [[justice]]," and
other works [[work]] of [[great]] notoriety.  though they had not been
favourably impressed with each other on their former acquaintance,
they now met under circumstances which permitted a mutual and just
appreciation of [[character]].  their intimacy increased by regular and
almost imperceptible degrees [[degree]].  the partiality they conceived for
each other was, according to her biographer, "in the most refined
style of [[love]].  it grew with [[equal]] advances in the [[mind]] of each.
it would have been impossible for the most minute observer to have
said who was before, or who after.  one [[sex]] did not take the
priority which long established custom has awarded it, nor the
other overstep that delicacy which is so severely imposed.  neither
party could assume to have been the agent or the patient, the
toil-spreader or the prey in the affair.  when in the course of
things the disclosure came, there was nothing in a manner for
either to disclose to the other."

mary lived but a few months after her [[marriage]], and died in
child-bed; having given birth to a [[daughter]] who is now known to the
literary [[world]] as mrs. shelly, the widow of percy bysche shelly.

we can scarcely avoid regret that one of such splendid [[talents]], and
high toned feelings, should, after the former seemed to have been
fully developed, and the latter had found an object in whom they
might repose, after their eccentric and painful efforts to find a
resting place--that such an one should at such a [[time]], be cut off
from [[life]] is something which we cannot contemplate without feeling
regret; we can scarcely repress the murmur that she had not been
removed ere clouds darkened her horizon, or that she had remained
to witness the brightness and serenity which might have succeeded.
but thus it is; we may trace the cause to anti-social arrangements;
it is not individuals [[individual]] but [[society]] which must [[change]] it, and that
not by enactments, but by a [[change]] in [[public]] [[opinion]].

the authoress of the "rights of woman," was born april 1759, died
september 1797.

that there may be no [[doubt]] regarding the facts [[fact]] in this sketch, they
are taken from a memoir written by her afflicted husband.  in
addition to many [[kind]] things he has said of her, (he was not
blinded to imperfections in her character) is, that she was "lovely
in her [[person]], and in the [[best]] and most engaging sense feminine in
her manners."


to

m. talleyrand perigord,

late bishop of autun.

sir:--

having [[read]] with [[great]] [[pleasure]] a pamphlet, which you have lately
published, on national [[education]], i dedicate this volume to you,
the first dedication that i have ever written, to induce you to
read it with attention; and, because i [[think]] that you will
understand me, which i do not suppose many pert witlings will, who
may ridicule the arguments they are unable to [[answer]].  but, sir, i
carry my [[respect]] for your understanding still farther:  so far,
that i am confident you will not throw my [[work]] aside, and hastily
conclude that i am in the [[wrong]] because you did not view the
subject in the same [[light]] yourself.  and pardon my frankness, but i
must observe, that you treated it in too cursory a manner,
contented to consider it as it had been considered formerly, when
the rights [[right]] of [[man]], not to advert to woman, were trampled on as
chimerical.  i call upon you, therefore, now to weigh what i have
advanced respecting the rights [[right]] of woman, and national [[education]];
and i call with the firm tone of [[humanity]].  for my arguments, sir,
are dictated by a disinterested spirit:  i plead for my [[sex]], not
for myself.  independence i have long considered as the grand
blessing of [[life]], the basis of every [[virtue]]; and independence i
will ever secure by contracting my wants, though i were to [[live]] on
a barren heath.

it is, then, an affection for the whole [[human]] [[race]] that makes my
pen dart rapidly along to support what i [[believe]] to be the cause of
virtue:  and the same motive leads me earnestly to [[wish]] to see
woman placed in a station in which she would advance, instead of
retarding, the [[progress]] of those glorious principles [[principle]] that give a
substance to morality.  my [[opinion]], indeed, respecting the rights
and duties [[duty]] of woman, seems to flow so naturally from these simple
principles, that i [[think]] it scarcely possible, but that some of the
enlarged minds [[mind]] who formed your admirable [[constitution]], will
coincide with me.

in [[france]], there is undoubtedly a more general diffusion of
knowledge than in any part of the [[european]] [[world]], and i attribute
it, in a [[great]] measure, to the social intercourse which has long
subsisted between the sexes [[sex]].  it is true, i utter my sentiments
with [[freedom]], that in [[france]] the very essence of sensuality has
been extracted to regale the voluptuary, and a [[kind]] of sentimental
lust has prevailed, which, together with the [[system]] of duplicity
that the whole tenor of their [[political]] and civil government
taught, have given a sinister sort of sagacity to the french
character, properly termed finesse; and a polish of manners that
injures the substance, by hunting sincerity out of [[society]].  and,
modesty, the fairest garb of [[virtue]] has been more grossly insulted
in [[france]] than even in [[england]], till their [[women]] have treated as
prudish that attention to decency which brutes instinctively
observe.

manners and morals [[moral]] are so nearly allied, that they have often been
confounded; but, though the former should only be the natural
reflection of the latter, yet, when various causes have produced
factitious and [[corrupt]] manners, which are very early caught,
morality becomes an empty name.  the personal reserve, and sacred
respect for cleanliness and delicacy in domestic [[life]], which french
women almost despise, are the graceful pillars of modesty; but, far
from despising them, if the pure flame of [[patriotism]] have reached
their bosoms, they should [[labour]] to improve the morals [[moral]] of their
fellow-citizens, by teaching [[men]], not only to [[respect]] modesty in
women, but to acquire it themselves, as the only way to [[merit]] their
esteem.

contending for the rights [[right]] of [[women]], my main argument is built on
this simple [[principle]], that if she be not prepared by [[education]] to
become the companion of [[man]], she will stop the [[progress]] of
knowledge, for [[truth]] must be [[common]] to all, or it will be
inefficacious with [[respect]] to its influence on general practice.
and how can woman be expected to co-operate, unless she [[know]] why
she ought to be [[virtuous]]?  unless [[freedom]] strengthen her reason
till she comprehend her [[duty]], and see in what manner it is
connected with her real [[good]]?  if [[children]] are to be educated to
understand the true [[principle]] of [[patriotism]], their [[mother]] must be a
patriot; and the [[love]] of [[mankind]], from which an orderly train of
virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the [[moral]] and
civil interest of [[mankind]]; but the [[education]] and situation of
woman, at [[present]], shuts her out from such investigations.

in this [[work]] i have produced many arguments, which to me were
conclusive, to prove, that the prevailing notion respecting a
sexual [[character]] was subversive of morality, and i have contended,
that to render the [[human]] [[body]] and [[mind]] more [[perfect]], chastity must
more universally prevail, and that chastity will never be respected
in the male [[world]] till the [[person]] of a woman is not, as it were,
idolized when little [[virtue]] or sense embellish it with the grand
traces of mental [[beauty]], or the interesting simplicity of
affection.

consider, sir, dispassionately, these observations, for a glimpse
of this [[truth]] seemed to open before you when you observed, "that to
see one half of the [[human]] [[race]] excluded by the other from all
participation of [[government]], was a [[political]] phenomenon that,
according to abstract principles [[principle]], it was impossible to explain."
if so, on what does your [[constitution]] rest?  if the abstract rights
of [[man]] will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a
parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a
different [[opinion]] prevails in this [[country]], built on the very
arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman,
prescription.

consider, i address you as a legislator, whether, when [[men]] contend
for their [[freedom]], and to be allowed to [[judge]] for themselves,
respecting their own [[happiness]], it be not inconsistent and unjust
to subjugate [[women]], even though you firmly [[believe]] that you are
acting in the manner [[best]] calculated to promote their [[happiness]]?
who made [[man]] the exclusive [[judge]], if woman partake with him the
gift of [[reason]]?

in this style, argue tyrants [[tyrant]] of every denomination from the weak
king to the [[weak]] [[father]] of a [[family]]; they are all eager to crush
reason; yet always assert that they usurp its [[throne]] only to be
useful.  do you not act a similar part, when you [[force]] all [[women]],
by denying them civil and [[political]] rights [[right]], to remain immured in
their families [[family]] groping in the dark? for surely, sir, you will not
assert, that a [[duty]] can be binding which is not founded on [[reason]]?
if, indeed, this be their destination, arguments may be drawn from
reason; and thus augustly supported, the more understanding women
acquire, the more they will be attached to their [[duty]],
comprehending it, for unless they comprehend it, unless their
morals be fixed on the same immutable principles [[principle]] as those of [[man]],
no [[authority]] can make them discharge it in a [[virtuous]] manner.  they
may be convenient slaves [[slave]], but [[slavery]] will have its constant
effect, degrading the master and the abject dependent.

but, if [[women]] are to be excluded, without having a voice, from a
participation of the [[natural]] rights [[right]] of [[mankind]], prove first, to
ward off the charge of [[injustice]] and inconsistency, that they want
reason, else this flaw in your new [[constitution]], the first
constitution founded on [[reason]], will ever show that [[man]] must, in
some shape, act like a [[tyrant]], and [[tyranny]], in whatever part of
society it rears its brazen front, will ever undermine morality.

i have repeatedly asserted, and produced what appeared to me
irrefragable arguments drawn from matters of [[fact]], to prove my
assertion, that [[women]] cannot, by [[force]], be confined to domestic
concerns; for they will however ignorant, intermeddle with more
weighty affairs, neglecting private duties [[duty]] only to disturb, by
cunning tricks, the orderly plans of [[reason]] which rise above their
comprehension.

besides, whilst they are only made to acquire personal
accomplishments, [[men]] will seek for [[pleasure]] in variety, and
faithless husbands will make faithless wives [[wife]]; such ignorant beings,
indeed, will be very excusable when, not taught to [[respect]] public
good, nor allowed any civil [[right]], they attempt to do themselves
justice by retaliation.

the box of mischief thus opened in [[society]], what is to preserve
private [[virtue]], the only security of [[public]] [[freedom]] and universal
happiness?

let there be then no coercion established in [[society]], and the
common [[law]] of gravity prevailing, the sexes [[sex]] will fall into their
proper places.  and, now that more equitable laws [[law]] are forming your
citizens, [[marriage]] may become more [[sacred]]; your [[young]] [[men]] may
choose wives [[wife]] from motives of affection, and your maidens allow love
to root out vanity.

the [[father]] of a [[family]] will not then weaken his [[constitution]] and
debase his sentiments, by visiting the harlot, nor forget, in
obeying the call of appetite, the [[purpose]] for which it was
implanted; and the [[mother]] will not neglect her [[children]] to practise
the [[arts]] of coquetry, when sense and modesty secure her the
friendship of her husband.

but, till [[men]] become attentive to the [[duty]] of a [[father]], it is vain
to expect [[women]] to spend that [[time]] in their nursery which they,
"wise in their [[generation]]," choose to spend at their glass; for
this exertion of cunning is only an instinct of [[nature]] to enable
them to obtain indirectly a little of that [[power]] of which they are
unjustly denied a share; for, if [[women]] are not permitted to enjoy
legitimate rights [[right]], they will render both [[men]] and themselves
vicious, to obtain illicit privileges [[privilege]].

i [[wish]], sir, to set some investigations of this [[kind]] afloat in
france; and should they lead to a confirmation of my principles [[principle]],
when your [[constitution]] is revised, the rights [[right]] of woman may be
respected, if it be fully proved that [[reason]] calls for this
respect, and loudly demands [[justice]] for one half of the [[human]] [[race]].

i am, sir,

yours respectfully,

m. w.


introduction.

after considering the historic page, and viewing the living world
with anxious solicitude, the most melancholy emotions of sorrowful
indignation have depressed my spirits, and i have sighed when
obliged to confess, that either [[nature]] has made a [[great]] difference
between [[man]] and [[man]], or that the [[civilization]], which has hitherto
taken place in the [[world]], has been very partial.  i have turned
over various books [[book]] written on the [[subject]] of [[education]], and
patiently observed the conduct of parents and the management of
schools; but what has been the result? a profound conviction, that
the neglected [[education]] of my fellow creatures is the grand source
of the misery i deplore; and that [[women]] in particular, are rendered
weak and wretched by a variety of concurring causes, originating
from one hasty conclusion.  the conduct and manners of [[women]], in
fact, evidently prove, that their minds [[mind]] are not in a healthy [[state]];
for, like the flowers that  are planted in too [[rich]] a soil,
strength and usefulness are sacrificed to [[beauty]]; and the flaunting
leaves, after having pleased a fastidious eye, fade, disregarded on
the stalk, long before the season when they ought to have arrived
at maturity.  one cause of this barren blooming i attribute to a
false [[system]] of [[education]], gathered from the books [[book]] written on this
subject by [[men]], who, considering females rather as [[women]] than human
creatures, have been more anxious to make them alluring mistresses
than [[rational]] wives [[wife]]; and the understanding of the [[sex]] has been so
bubbled by this specious homage, that the civilized [[women]] of the
present century, with a few exceptions, are only anxious to inspire
love, when they ought to cherish a nobler [[ambition]], and by their
abilities and virtues [[virtue]] exact [[respect]].

in a treatise, therefore, on female rights [[right]] and manners, the works
which have been particularly written for their improvement must not
be overlooked; especially when it is asserted, in direct terms,
that the minds [[mind]] of [[women]] are enfeebled by false refinement; that the
books of instruction, written by [[men]] of genius, have had the same
tendency as more frivolous productions; and that, in the true style
of mahometanism, they are only considered as females, and not as a
part of the [[human]] [[species]], when improvable [[reason]] is allowed to be
the dignified distinction, which raises [[men]] above the brute
creation, and puts a [[natural]] sceptre in a feeble hand.

yet, because i am a woman, i would not lead my readers to suppose,
that i mean violently to agitate the contested [[question]] respecting
the equality and inferiority of the [[sex]]; but as the [[subject]] lies [[lie]] in
my way, and i cannot pass it over without subjecting the main
tendency of my reasoning to misconstruction, i shall stop a moment
to deliver, in a few words, my [[opinion]].  in the [[government]] of the
physical [[world]], it is observable that the female, in general, is
inferior to the male.  the male pursues, the female yields--this is
the [[law]] of [[nature]]; and it does not appear to be suspended or
abrogated in favour of woman.  this physical superiority cannot be
denied--and it is a [[noble]] prerogative!  but not content with this
natural pre-eminence, [[men]] endeavour to sink us still lower, merely
to render us alluring objects for a moment; and [[women]], intoxicated
by the adoration which [[men]], under the influence of their senses,
pay them, do not seek to obtain a durable interest in their hearts [[heart]],
or to become the [[friends]] of the fellow creatures who find amusement
in their [[society]].

i am aware of an obvious inference: from every quarter have i heard
exclamations against masculine [[women]]; but where are they to be
found?  if, by this appellation, [[men]] mean to inveigh against their
ardour in hunting, shooting, and gaming, i shall most cordially
join in the cry; but if it be, against the imitation of manly
virtues, or, more properly speaking, the attainment of those
talents and virtues [[virtue]], the exercise of which ennobles the human
character, and which raise females in the scale of animal being,
when they are comprehensively termed mankind--all those who view
them with a philosophical eye must, i should [[think]], [[wish]] with me,
that they may every day grow more and more masculine.

this discussion naturally divides the [[subject]].  i shall first
consider [[women]] in the grand [[light]] of [[human]] creatures, who, in
common with [[men]], are placed on this [[earth]] to unfold their
faculties; and afterwards i shall more particularly point out their
peculiar designation.

i [[wish]] also to steer clear of an error, which many respectable
writers have fallen into; for the instruction which has hitherto
been addressed to [[women]], has rather been applicable to ladies [[lady]], if
the little indirect [[advice]], that is scattered through sandford and
merton, be excepted; but, addressing my [[sex]] in a firmer tone, i pay
particular attention to those in the middle class, because they
appear to be in the most [[natural]] [[state]].  perhaps the seeds of false
refinement, immorality, and vanity have ever been shed by the
great.  [[weak]], artificial beings raised above the [[common]] wants and
affections of their [[race]], in a premature unnatural manner,
undermine the very foundation of [[virtue]], and spread corruption
through the whole mass of society!  as a class of [[mankind]] they have
the strongest claim to pity! the [[education]] of the [[rich]] tends to
render them [[vain]] and helpless, and the unfolding [[mind]] is not
strengthened by the practice of those duties [[duty]] which dignify the
human [[character]].  they only [[live]] to amuse themselves, and by the
same [[law]] which in [[nature]] invariably produces [[produce]] [[certain]] effects, they
soon only afford barren amusement.

but as i [[purpose]] taking a separate view of the different ranks of
society, and of the [[moral]] [[character]] of [[women]], in each, this hint
is, for the [[present]], sufficient; and i have only alluded to the
subject, because it appears to me to be the very essence of an
introduction to give a cursory account of the contents of the work
it introduces.

my own [[sex]], i [[hope]], will excuse me, if i treat them like rational
creatures, instead of flattering their fascinating graces, and
viewing them as if they were in a [[state]] of perpetual [[childhood]],
unable to stand alone.  i earnestly [[wish]] to point out in what true
dignity and [[human]] [[happiness]] consists--i [[wish]] to persuade [[women]] to
endeavour to acquire [[strength]], both of [[mind]] and [[body]], and to
convince them, that the soft phrases, susceptibility of [[heart]],
delicacy of sentiment, and refinement of taste, are almost
synonymous with epithets of weakness, and that those beings who are
only the objects of [[pity]] and that [[kind]] of [[love]], which has been
termed its sister, will soon become objects of contempt.

dismissing then those pretty feminine phrases, which the men
condescendingly use to soften our slavish dependence, and despising
that [[weak]] elegancy of [[mind]], exquisite sensibility, and sweet
docility of manners, supposed to be the [[sexual]] characteristics of
the weaker vessel, i [[wish]] to show that elegance is inferior to
virtue, that the first object of laudable [[ambition]] is to obtain a
character as a [[human]] being, regardless of the distinction of [[sex]];
and that secondary views should be brought to this simple
touchstone.

this is a rough sketch of my plan; and should i express my
conviction with the energetic emotions that i [[feel]] whenever i think
of the [[subject]], the dictates of [[experience]] and reflection will be
felt by some of my readers.  animated by this important object, i
shall disdain to cull my phrases or polish my style--i aim at being
useful, and sincerity will render me unaffected; for wishing rather
to persuade by the [[force]] of my arguments, than dazzle by the
elegance of my [[language]], i shall not waste my [[time]] in rounding
periods, nor in fabricating the turgid bombast of artificial
feelings, which, coming from the head, never reach the [[heart]].  i
shall be employed about things, not words! and, anxious to render
my [[sex]] more respectable members of [[society]], i shall try to avoid
that flowery diction which has slided from essays into novels, and
from novels into familiar letters and conversation.

these pretty nothings, these caricatures of the real [[beauty]] of
sensibility, dropping glibly from the tongue, vitiate the taste,
and create a [[kind]] of sickly delicacy that turns away from simple
unadorned [[truth]]; and a deluge of false sentiments and
over-stretched feelings, stifling the [[natural]] emotions of the
heart, render the domestic pleasures [[pleasure]] insipid, that ought to sweeten
the exercise of those severe duties [[duty]], which educate a [[rational]] and
immortal being for a nobler field of action.

the [[education]] of [[women]] has, of late, been more attended to than
formerly; yet they are still reckoned a frivolous [[sex]], and
ridiculed or pitied by the writers who endeavour by satire or
instruction to improve them.  it is acknowledged that they spend
many of the first years of their lives [[life]] in acquiring a smattering of
accomplishments:  meanwhile, [[strength]] of [[body]] and [[mind]] are
sacrificed to libertine notions of [[beauty]], to the [[desire]] of
establishing themselves, the only way [[women]] can rise in the
world--by [[marriage]].  and this [[desire]] making mere animals of them,
when they [[marry]], they act as such [[children]] may be expected to act:
they dress; they paint, and nickname god's creatures.  surely these
weak beings are only fit for the seraglio!  can they govern a
family, or take [[care]] of the [[poor]] babes whom they bring into the
world?

if then it can be fairly deduced from the [[present]] conduct of the
sex, from the prevalent fondness for [[pleasure]], which takes place of
ambition and those nobler [[passions]] that open and enlarge the [[soul]];
that the instruction which [[women]] have received has only tended,
with the [[constitution]] of civil [[society]], to render them
insignificant objects of [[desire]]; mere propagators of fools! if it
can be proved, that in aiming to accomplish them, without
cultivating their understandings, they are taken out of their
sphere of duties [[duty]], and made ridiculous and useless when the short
lived bloom of [[beauty]] is over*, i presume that [[rational]] [[men]] will
excuse me for endeavouring to persuade them to become more
masculine and respectable.

(*footnote.  a lively writer, i cannot recollect his name, asks
what [[business]] [[women]] turned of forty have to do in the [[world]].)

indeed the word masculine is only a bugbear:  there is little
reason to [[fear]] that [[women]] will acquire too much [[courage]] or
fortitude; for their apparent inferiority with [[respect]] to bodily
strength, must render them, in some [[degree]], dependent on [[men]] in the
various relations of [[life]]; but why should it be increased by
prejudices that give a [[sex]] to [[virtue]], and confound simple truths
with sensual reveries?

women are, in [[fact]], so much degraded by mistaken notions of female
excellence, that i do not mean to add a paradox when i assert, that
this artificial weakness produces [[produce]] a propensity to tyrannize, and
gives birth to cunning, the [[natural]] opponent of [[strength]], which
leads them to play off those contemptible infantile airs that
undermine esteem even whilst they excite [[desire]].  do not foster
these prejudices, and they will naturally fall into their
subordinate, yet respectable station in [[life]].

it seems scarcely necessary to say, that i now speak of the [[sex]] in
general.  many individuals [[individual]] have more sense than their male
relatives; and, as nothing preponderates where there is a constant
struggle for an equilibrium, without it has naturally more gravity,
some [[women]] govern their husbands without degrading themselves,
because [[intellect]] will always govern.


vindication of the rights [[right]] of woman.


chapter 1.

the rights [[right]] and involved duties [[duty]] of [[mankind]] considered.

in the [[present]] [[state]] of [[society]], it appears necessary to go back to
first principles [[principle]] in search of the most simple truths [[truth]], and to
dispute with some prevailing prejudice every inch of ground.  to
clear my way, i must be allowed to ask some plain questions [[question]], and
the answers [[answer]] will probably appear as unequivocal as the axioms on
which reasoning is built; though, when entangled with various
motives of action, they are formally contradicted, either by the
words or conduct of [[men]].

in what does man's [[man]] pre-eminence over the brute creation consist?
the [[answer]] is as clear as that a half is less than the whole; in
reason.

what acquirement exalts one being above another?  [[virtue]]; we
spontaneously reply.

for what [[purpose]] were the [[passions]] implanted?  that [[man]] by
struggling with them might attain a [[degree]] of [[knowledge]] denied to
the brutes:  whispers [[experience]].

consequently the [[perfection]] of our [[nature]] and capability of
happiness, must be estimated by the [[degree]] of [[reason]], [[virtue]], and
knowledge, that distinguish the [[individual]], and direct the laws
which bind [[society]]:  and that from the exercise of [[reason]],
knowledge and [[virtue]] naturally flow, is equally undeniable, if
mankind be viewed collectively.

the rights [[right]] and duties [[duty]] of [[man]] thus simplified, it seems almost
impertinent to attempt to illustrate truths [[truth]] that appear so
incontrovertible:  yet such deeply rooted prejudices have clouded
reason, and such spurious qualities have assumed the name of
virtues, that it is necessary to pursue the course of [[reason]] as it
has been perplexed and involved in error, by various adventitious
circumstances, comparing the simple axiom with casual deviations.

men, in general, seem to employ their [[reason]] to justify prejudices,
which they have imbibed, they cannot trace how, rather than to root
them out.  the [[mind]] must be [[strong]] that resolutely forms its own
principles; for a [[kind]] of intellectual cowardice prevails which
makes many [[men]] shrink from the task, or only do it by halves.  yet
the imperfect conclusions thus drawn, are frequently very
plausible, because they are built on partial [[experience]], on just,
though narrow, views.

going back to first principles [[principle]], [[vice]] skulks, with all its native
deformity, from close investigation; but a set of shallow reasoners
are always exclaiming that these arguments prove too much, and that
a measure rotten at the core may be expedient.  thus expediency is
continually contrasted with simple principles [[principle]], till [[truth]] is lost
in a mist of words, [[virtue]] in forms, and [[knowledge]] rendered a
sounding nothing, by the specious prejudices that assume its name.

that the [[society]] is formed in the wisest manner, whose constitution
is founded on the [[nature]] of [[man]], strikes, in the abstract, every
thinking being so forcibly, that it looks like presumption to
endeavour to bring forward proofs; though proof must be brought, or
the [[strong]] hold of prescription will never be forced by [[reason]]; yet
to urge prescription as an argument to justify the depriving men
(or women) of their [[natural]] rights [[right]], is one of the absurd sophisms
which daily insult [[common]] sense.

the [[civilization]] of the bulk of the [[people]] of [[europe]], is very
partial; nay, it may be made a [[question]], whether they have acquired
any virtues [[virtue]] in exchange for innocence, equivalent to the misery
produced by the vices [[vice]] that have been plastered over unsightly
ignorance, and the [[freedom]] which has been bartered for splendid
slavery.  the [[desire]] of dazzling by riches [[rich]], the most certain
pre-eminence that [[man]] can obtain, the [[pleasure]] of commanding
flattering sycophants, and many other complicated low calculations
of doting self-love, have all contributed to overwhelm the mass of
mankind, and make [[liberty]] a convenient handle for mock [[patriotism]].
for whilst rank and titles are held of the utmost importance,
before which genius "must hide its diminished head," it is, with a
few exceptions, very unfortunate for a nation when a [[man]] of
abilities, without rank or [[property]], pushes himself forward to
notice.  alas! what unheard of misery have thousands [[suffered]] to
purchase a cardinal's hat for an intriguing obscure adventurer, who
longed to be ranked with princes [[prince]], or [[lord]] it over them by seizing
the triple crown!

such, indeed, has been the wretchedness that has flowed from
hereditary honours [[honour]], riches [[rich]], and [[monarchy]], that [[men]] of lively
sensibility have almost uttered blasphemy in order to justify the
dispensations of providence.  [[man]] has been held out as independent
of his [[power]] who made him, or as a lawless planet darting from its
orbit to steal the celestial [[fire]] of [[reason]]; and the vengeance of
heaven, lurking in the subtile flame, sufficiently punished his
temerity, by introducing [[evil]] into the [[world]].

impressed by this view of the misery and disorder which pervaded
society, and fatigued with jostling against artificial fools [[fool]],
rousseau became enamoured of solitude, and, being at the same time
an optimist, he labours [[labour]] with uncommon eloquence to prove that man
was naturally a solitary animal.  misled by his [[respect]] for the
goodness of [[god]], who certainly for what [[man]] of sense and feeling
can [[doubt]] it! gave [[life]] only to communicate [[happiness]], he considers
evil as positive, and the [[work]] of [[man]]; not aware that he was
exalting one attribute at the expense of another, equally necessary
to [[divine]] [[perfection]].

reared on a false hypothesis, his arguments in favour of a [[state]] of
nature are plausible, but unsound.  i say unsound; for to assert
that a [[state]] of [[nature]] is preferable to [[civilization]] in all its
possible [[perfection]], is, in other words, to arraign supreme [[wisdom]];
and the paradoxical exclamation, that [[god]] has made all things
right, and that [[evil]] has been introduced by the creature whom he
formed, knowing what he formed, is as unphilosophical as impious.

when that [[wise]] being, who created us and placed us here, saw the
fair [[idea]], he willed, by allowing it to be so, that the passions
should unfold our [[reason]], because he could see that [[present]] evil
would [[produce]] future [[good]].  could the helpless creature whom he
called from nothing, break loose from his providence, and boldly
learn to [[know]] [[good]] by practising [[evil]] without his permission?  no.
how could that energetic advocate for immortality argue so
inconsistently?  had [[mankind]] remained for ever in the brutal state
of [[nature]], which even his magic pen cannot paint as a [[state]] in
which a [[single]] [[virtue]] took root, it would have been clear, though
not to the sensitive unreflecting wanderer, that [[man]] was born to
run the circle of [[life]] and [[death]], and adorn god's garden for some
purpose which could not easily be reconciled with his attributes.

but if, to [[crown]] the whole, there were to be [[rational]] creatures
produced, allowed to rise in excellency by the exercise of powers
implanted for that [[purpose]]; if benignity itself [[thought]] fit to call
into existence a creature above the brutes, who could [[think]] and
improve himself, why should that inestimable gift, for a gift it
was, if a [[man]] was so created as to have a capacity to rise above
the [[state]] in which sensation produced brutal ease, be called, in
direct terms, a curse?  a curse it might be reckoned, if all our
existence was bounded by our continuance in this [[world]]; for why
should the gracious fountain of [[life]] give us [[passions]], and the
power of reflecting, only to embitter our days, and inspire us with
mistaken notions of [[dignity]]?  why should he lead us from [[love]] of
ourselves to the sublime emotions which the discovery of his wisdom
and goodness excites, if these feelings were not set in motion to
improve our [[nature]], of which they make a part, and render us
capable of enjoying a more godlike portion of [[happiness]]?  firmly
persuaded that no [[evil]] exists in the [[world]] that [[god]] did not design
to take place, i build my [[belief]] on the [[perfection]] of [[god]].

rousseau exerts himself to prove, that all was [[right]] originally:  a
crowd of authors that all is now [[right]]:  and i, that all will be
right.

but, true to his first position, next to a [[state]] of [[nature]],
rousseau celebrates barbarism, and, apostrophizing the shade of
fabricius, he forgets that, in conquering the [[world]], the romans
never dreamed of establishing their own [[liberty]] on a firm basis, or
of extending the reign of [[virtue]].  eager to support his [[system]], he
stigmatizes, as vicious, every effort of genius; and uttering the
apotheosis of savage virtues [[virtue]], he exalts those to demigods, who were
scarcely human--the brutal spartans, who in defiance of [[justice]] and
gratitude, sacrificed, in cold [[blood]], the slaves [[slave]] that had shown
themselves [[men]] to rescue their oppressors.

disgusted with artificial manners and virtues [[virtue]], the citizen of
geneva, instead of properly sifting the [[subject]], threw away the
wheat with the chaff, without waiting to inquire whether the evils [[evil]],
which his ardent [[soul]] turned from indignantly, were the consequence
of [[civilization]], or the vestiges of barbarism.  he saw vice
trampling on [[virtue]], and the semblance of goodness taking place of
the reality; he saw [[talents]] bent by [[power]] to sinister purposes [[purpose]], and
never [[thought]] of tracing the gigantic mischief up to arbitrary
power, up to the hereditary distinctions that clash with the mental
superiority that naturally raises a [[man]] above his fellows.  he did
not perceive, that the regal [[power]], in a few generations [[generation]],
introduces idiotism into the [[noble]] stem, and holds out baits to
render thousands idle and vicious.

nothing can set the regal [[character]] in a more contemptible point of
view, than the various crimes that have elevated [[men]] to the supreme
dignity.  vile intrigues, unnatural crimes, and every [[vice]] that
degrades our [[nature]], have been the steps to this distinguished
eminence; yet millions of [[men]] have supinely allowed the nerveless
limbs of the [[posterity]] of such rapacious prowlers, to rest quietly
on their ensanguined thrones.

what but a pestilential vapour can hover over [[society]], when its
chief director is only instructed in the invention of crimes, or
the stupid routine of childish ceremonies [[ceremony]]?  will [[men]] never be [[wise]]?
will they never cease to expect corn from tares, and figs from
thistles?

it is impossible for any [[man]], when the most favourable
circumstances concur, to acquire sufficient [[knowledge]] and strength
of [[mind]] to discharge the duties [[duty]] of a [[king]], entrusted with
uncontrolled [[power]]; how then must they be violated when his very
elevation is an insuperable bar to the attainment of either wisdom
or [[virtue]]; when all the feelings of a [[man]] are stifled by [[flattery]],
and reflection shut out by pleasure!  surely it is madness to make
the [[fate]] of thousands depend on the caprice of a [[weak]] fellow
creature, whose very station sinks him necessarily below the
meanest of his subjects!  but one [[power]] should not be thrown down
to exalt another--for all [[power]] intoxicates [[weak]] [[man]]; and its abuse
proves, that the more equality there is established among [[men]], the
more [[virtue]] and [[happiness]] will reign in [[society]].  but this, and any
similar [[maxim]] deduced from simple [[reason]], raises an outcry--the
church or the [[state]] is in danger, if [[faith]] in the [[wisdom]] of
antiquity is not implicit; and they who, roused by the sight of
human calamity, dare to attack [[human]] [[authority]], are reviled as
despisers of [[god]], and enemies [[enemy]] of [[man]].  these are bitter calumnies,
yet they reached one of the [[best]] of [[men]], (dr. price.) whose ashes
still preach [[peace]], and whose memory demands a respectful pause,
when subjects [[subject]] are discussed that lay so near his [[heart]].

after attacking the [[sacred]] majesty of kings [[king]], i shall scarcely
excite surprise, by adding my firm persuasion, that every
profession, in which [[great]] subordination of rank constitutes its
power, is highly injurious to morality.

a standing [[army]], for instance, is incompatible with [[freedom]];
because subordination and rigour are the very sinews of military
discipline; and despotism is necessary to give vigour to
enterprises that one will directs.  a spirit inspired by romantic
notions of [[honour]], a [[kind]] of morality founded on the [[fashion]] of the
age, can only be [[felt]] by a few officers, whilst the main [[body]] must
be moved by command, like the waves of the sea; for the [[strong]] wind
of [[authority]] pushes the crowd of subalterns forward, they scarcely
know or [[care]] why, with headlong fury.

besides, nothing can be so prejudicial to the morals [[moral]] of the
inhabitants of [[country]] towns, as the occasional residence of a set
of idle superficial [[young]] [[men]], whose only occupation is gallantry,
and whose polished manners render [[vice]] more dangerous, by
concealing its deformity under [[gay]] ornamental drapery.  an air of
fashion, which is but a badge of [[slavery]], and proves that the soul
has not a [[strong]] [[individual]] [[character]], awes simple [[country]] people
into an imitation of the vices [[vice]], when they cannot catch the slippery
graces of politeness.  every corps is a chain of despots, who,
submitting and tyrannizing without exercising their [[reason]], become
dead weights of [[vice]] and folly on the [[community]].  a [[man]] of rank or
fortune, sure of rising by interest, has nothing to do but to
pursue some extravagant freak; whilst the needy gentleman, who is
to rise, as the phrase turns, by his [[merit]], becomes a servile
parasite or vile pander.

sailors, the naval gentlemen, come under the same description, only
their vices [[vice]] assume a different and a grosser cast.  they are more
positively indolent, when not discharging the ceremonials of their
station; whilst the insignificant fluttering of soldiers may be
termed active idleness.  more confined to the [[society]] of [[men]], the
former acquire a fondness for [[humour]] and mischievous tricks; whilst
the latter, mixing frequently with well-bred [[women]], catch a
sentimental cant.  but [[mind]] is equally out of the [[question]], whether
they indulge the horse-laugh or polite simper.

may i be allowed to extend the comparison to a profession where
more [[mind]] is certainly to be found; for the clergy have superior
opportunities of improvement, though subordination almost equally
cramps their faculties? the blind submission imposed at college to
forms of [[belief]], serves as a noviciate to the curate who most
obsequiously respects [[respect]] the [[opinion]] of his rector or patron, if he
means to rise in his profession.  perhaps there cannot be a more
forcible contrast than between the servile, dependent gait of a
poor curate, and the courtly mien of a bishop.  and the [[respect]] and
contempt they inspire render the discharge of their separate
functions equally useless.

it is of [[great]] importance to observe, that the [[character]] of every
man is, in some [[degree]], formed by his profession.  a [[man]] of sense
may only have a cast of countenance that wears off as you trace his
individuality, whilst the [[weak]], [[common]] [[man]], has scarcely ever any
character, but what belongs to the [[body]]; at least, all his opinions
have been so steeped in the vat consecrated by [[authority]], that the
faint spirit which the grape of his own vine yields cannot be
distinguished.

society, therefore, as it becomes more enlightened, should be very
careful not to establish bodies [[body]] of [[men]] who must necessarily be made
foolish or vicious by the very [[constitution]] of their profession.

in the infancy of [[society]], when [[men]] were just emerging out of
barbarism, chiefs [[chief]] and priests [[priest]], touching the most powerful springs
of savage conduct--hope and fear--must have had unbounded sway.  an
aristocracy, of course, is naturally the first form of [[government]].
but clashing interests soon losing their equipoise, a [[monarchy]] and
hierarchy break out of the confusion of ambitious struggles, and
the foundation of both is secured by feudal tenures.  this appears
to be the origin of monarchial and priestly [[power]], and the dawn of
civilization.  but such combustible materials cannot long be pent
up; and getting vent in [[foreign]] wars [[war]] and intestine insurrections,
the [[people]] acquire some [[power]] in the tumult, which obliges their
rulers to gloss over their oppression with a show of [[right]].  thus,
as wars [[war]], agriculture, commerce, and literature, expands the [[mind]],
despots are compelled, to make covert [[corruption]] hold fast the
power which was formerly snatched by open [[force]].*  and this baneful
lurking gangrene is most quickly spread by luxury and superstition,
the sure dregs of [[ambition]].  the indolent puppet of a court first
becomes a luxurious monster, or fastidious sensualist, and then
makes the contagion which his unnatural [[state]] spreads, the
instrument of [[tyranny]].

(*footnote.  [[men]] of abilities scatter seeds that grow up, and have
a [[great]] influence on the forming [[opinion]]; and when once the public
opinion preponderates, through the exertion of [[reason]], the
overthrow of arbitrary [[power]] is not very distant.)

it is the pestiferous purple which renders the [[progress]] of
civilization a curse, and warps the understanding, till [[men]] of
sensibility [[doubt]] whether the expansion of [[intellect]] produces [[produce]] a
greater portion of [[happiness]] or misery.  but the [[nature]] of the
poison points out the antidote; and had [[rousseau]] mounted one step
higher in his investigation; or could his eye have pierced through
the foggy atmosphere, which he almost disdained to breathe, his
active [[mind]] would have darted forward to contemplate the perfection
of [[man]] in the establishment of true [[civilization]], instead of taking
his ferocious flight back to the night of sensual ignorance.


chapter 2.

the prevailing [[opinion]] of a [[sexual]] [[character]] discussed.

to account for, and excuse the [[tyranny]] of [[man]], many ingenious
arguments have been brought forward to prove, that the two sexes [[sex]],
in the acquirement of [[virtue]], ought to aim at attaining a very
different [[character]]:  or, to speak explicitly, [[women]] are not
allowed to have sufficient [[strength]] of [[mind]] to acquire what really
deserves the name of [[virtue]].  yet it should seem, allowing them to
have souls [[soul]], that there is but one way appointed by providence to
lead [[mankind]] to either [[virtue]] or [[happiness]].

if then [[women]] are not a swarm of ephemeron triflers, why should
they be kept in ignorance under the specious name of innocence?
men [[complain]], and with [[reason]], of the follies and caprices of our
sex, when they do not keenly satirize our headstrong [[passions]] and
groveling vices [[vice]].  behold, i should [[answer]], the [[natural]] effect of
ignorance!  the [[mind]] will ever be unstable that has only prejudices
to rest on, and the current will run with destructive fury when
there are no barriers to break its [[force]].  [[women]] are told from
their infancy, and taught by the [[example]] of their mothers [[mother]], that a
little [[knowledge]] of [[human]] weakness, justly termed cunning, softness
of temper, outward [[obedience]], and a scrupulous attention to a
puerile [[kind]] of propriety, will obtain for them the protection of
man; and should they be beautiful, every thing else is needless,
for at least twenty years of their lives [[life]].

thus milton describes our first frail [[mother]]; though when he tells
us that [[women]] are formed for softness and sweet attractive grace, i
cannot comprehend his meaning, unless, in the true mahometan
strain, he meant to deprive us of souls [[soul]], and insinuate that we were
beings only designed by sweet attractive grace, and docile blind
obedience, to gratify the senses of [[man]] when he can no longer soar
on the wing of contemplation.

how grossly do they insult us, who thus advise us only to render
ourselves gentle, domestic brutes!  for instance, the winning
softness, so warmly, and frequently recommended, that governs by
obeying.  what childish expressions, and how insignificant is the
being--can it be an [[immortal]] one?  who will condescend to govern by
such sinister methods!  "certainly," says [[lord]] bacon, "man is of
kin to the beasts by his [[body]]: and if he be not of kin to [[god]] by
his spirit, he is a base and ignoble creature!"  [[men]], indeed,
appear to me to act in a very unphilosophical manner, when they try
to secure the [[good]] conduct of [[women]] by attempting to keep them
always in a [[state]] of [[childhood]].  [[rousseau]] was more consistent when
he wished to stop the [[progress]] of [[reason]] in both sexes [[sex]]; for if men
eat of the tree of [[knowledge]], [[women]] will come in for a taste:  but,
from the imperfect cultivation which their understandings now
receive, they only attain a [[knowledge]] of [[evil]].

children, i grant, should be [[innocent]]; but when the epithet is
applied to [[men]], or [[women]], it is but a civil term for weakness.  for
if it be allowed that [[women]] were destined by providence to acquire
human virtues [[virtue]], and by the exercise of their understandings, that
stability of [[character]] which is the firmest ground to rest our
future hopes [[hope]] upon, they must be permitted to turn to the fountain
of [[light]], and not forced to shape their course by the twinkling of
a mere satellite.  milton, i grant, was of a very different
opinion; for he only bends to the indefeasible [[right]] of [[beauty]],
though it would be difficult to render two passages, which i now
mean to contrast, consistent:  but into similar inconsistencies are
great [[men]] often [[led]] by their senses:--

"to whom thus eve with [[perfect]] [[beauty]] adorned:
my author and disposer, what thou bidst
unargued i obey; so [[god]] ordains;
god is thy [[law]], thou mine; to [[know]] no more
is woman's happiest [[knowledge]] and her [[praise]]."

these are exactly the arguments that i have used to [[children]]; but i
have added, "your [[reason]] is now gaining [[strength]], and, till it
arrives at some [[degree]] of maturity, you must look up to me for
advice:  then you ought to [[think]], and only rely on [[god]]."

yet, in the following lines, milton seems to coincide with me, when
he makes adam thus expostulate with his maker:--

"hast thou not made me here thy substitute,
and these inferior far beneath me set?
among unequals what society
can sort, what harmony or delight?
which must be mutual, in proportion due
given and received; but in disparity
the one intense, the other still remiss
cannot well suit with either, but soon prove
tedious alike:  of fellowship i speak
such as i seek fit to participate
all [[rational]] delight."

in treating, therefore, of the manners of [[women]], let us,
disregarding sensual arguments, trace what we should endeavour to
make them in order to co-operate, if the expression be not too
bold, with the supreme being.

by [[individual]] [[education]], i mean--for the sense of the word is not
precisely defined--such an attention to a child as will slowly
sharpen the senses, form the temper, regulate the [[passions]], as they
begin to ferment, and set the understanding to [[work]] before the body
arrives at maturity; so that the [[man]] may only have to proceed, not
to begin, the important task of learning to [[think]] and [[reason]].

to prevent any misconstruction, i must add, that i do not believe
that a private [[education]] can [[work]] the wonders which some sanguine
writers have attributed to it.  [[men]] and [[women]] must be educated, in
a [[great]] [[degree]], by the opinions [[opinion]] and manners of the [[society]] they
live in.  in every [[age]] there has been a stream of popular opinion
that has carried all before it, and given a [[family]] [[character]], as it
were, to the century.  it may then fairly be inferred, that, till
society be differently constituted, much cannot be expected from
education.  it is, however, sufficient for my [[present]] [[purpose]] to
assert, that, whatever effect circumstances have on the abilities,
every being may become [[virtuous]] by the exercise of its own [[reason]];
for if but one being was created with vicious inclinations--that
is, positively bad-- what can save us from atheism? or if we
worship a [[god]], is not that [[god]] a [[devil]]?

consequently, the most [[perfect]] [[education]], in my [[opinion]], is such an
exercise of the understanding as is [[best]] calculated to strengthen
the [[body]] and form the [[heart]]; or, in other words, to enable the
individual to attain such habits of [[virtue]] as will render it
independent.  in [[fact]], it is a farce to call any being virtuous
whose virtues [[virtue]] do not result from the exercise of its own [[reason]].
this was rousseau's [[opinion]] respecting [[men]]:  i extend it to [[women]],
and confidently assert that they have been drawn out of their
sphere by false refinement, and not by an endeavour to acquire
masculine qualities.  still the regal homage which they receive is
so intoxicating, that, till the manners of the times [[time]] are changed,
and formed on more reasonable principles [[principle]], it may be impossible to
convince them that the illegitimate [[power]], which they obtain by
degrading themselves, is a curse, and that they must return to
nature and equality, if they [[wish]] to secure the placid satisfaction
that unsophisticated affections impart.  but for this epoch we must
wait--wait, perhaps, till kings [[king]] and nobles [[noble]], enlightened by [[reason]],
and, preferring the real [[dignity]] of [[man]] to childish [[state]], throw
off their gaudy hereditary trappings; and if then [[women]] do not
resign the arbitrary [[power]] of [[beauty]], they will prove that they
have less [[mind]] than [[man]].  i may be accused of arrogance; still i
must declare, what i firmly [[believe]], that all the writers who have
written on the [[subject]] of female [[education]] and manners, from
rousseau to dr. gregory, have contributed to render [[women]] more
artificial, weaker characters [[character]], than they would otherwise have been;
and, consequently, more useless members of [[society]].  i might have
expressed this conviction in a lower key; but i am afraid it would
have been the whine of affectation, and not the faithful expression
of my feelings, of the clear result, which [[experience]] and
reflection have [[led]] me to draw.  when i come to that division of
the [[subject]], i shall advert to the passages that i more
particularly disapprove of, in the works [[work]] of the authors i have just
alluded to; but it is first necessary to observe, that my objection
extends to the whole purport of those books [[book]], which tend, in my
opinion, to degrade one half of the [[human]] [[species]], and render women
pleasing at the expense of every solid [[virtue]].

though to [[reason]] on rousseau's ground, if [[man]] did attain a degree
of [[perfection]] of [[mind]] when his [[body]] arrived at maturity, it might
be proper in order to make a [[man]] and his [[wife]] one, that she should
rely entirely on his understanding; and the graceful ivy, clasping
the oak that supported it, would form a whole in which [[strength]] and
beauty would be equally conspicuous.  but, alas! husbands, as well
as their helpmates, are often only overgrown [[children]]; nay, thanks
to early debauchery, scarcely [[men]] in their outward form, and if the
blind lead the blind, one need not come from [[heaven]] to tell us the
consequence.

many are the causes that, in the [[present]] [[corrupt]] [[state]] of [[society]],
contribute to enslave [[women]] by cramping their understandings and
sharpening their senses.  one, perhaps, that silently does more
mischief than all the rest, is their disregard of order.

to do every thing in an orderly manner, is a most important
precept, which [[women]], who, generally speaking, receive only a
disorderly [[kind]] of [[education]], seldom attend to with that [[degree]] of
exactness that [[men]], who from their infancy are broken into method,
observe.  this negligent [[kind]] of guesswork, for what other epithet
can be used to point out the random exertions of a sort of
instinctive [[common]] sense, never brought to the test of [[reason]]?
prevents their generalizing matters of [[fact]], so they do to-day,
what they did yesterday, merely because they did it yesterday.

this contempt of the understanding in early [[life]] has more baneful
consequences than is commonly supposed; for the little knowledge
which [[women]] of [[strong]] minds [[mind]] attain, is, from various circumstances,
of a more desultory [[kind]] than the [[knowledge]] of [[men]], and it is
acquired more by sheer observations on real [[life]], than from
comparing what has been individually observed with the results of
experience generalized by speculation.  [[led]] by their dependent
situation and domestic employments more into [[society]], what they
learn is rather by snatches; and as learning is with them, in
general, only a secondary thing, they do not pursue any one branch
with that persevering ardour necessary to give vigour to the
faculties, and clearness to the [[judgment]].  in the [[present]] [[state]] of
society, a little learning is required to support the [[character]] of
a gentleman; and boys are obliged to submit to a few years of
discipline.  but in the [[education]] of [[women]] the cultivation of the
understanding is always subordinate to the acquirement of some
corporeal accomplishment; even while enervated by confinement and
false notions of modesty, the [[body]] is prevented from attaining that
grace and [[beauty]] which relaxed half-formed limbs never exhibit.
besides, in [[youth]] their faculties are not brought forward by
emulation; and having no serious scientific study, if they have
natural sagacity it is turned too soon on [[life]] and manners.  they
dwell on effects, and modifications, without tracing them back to
causes; and complicated rules [[rule]] to adjust behaviour are a weak
substitute for simple principles [[principle]].

as a proof that [[education]] gives this appearance of weakness to
females, we may instance the [[example]] of [[military]] [[men]], who are, like
them, sent into the [[world]] before their minds [[mind]] have been stored with
knowledge or fortified by principles [[principle]].  the consequences are
similar; soldiers acquire a little superficial [[knowledge]], snatched
from the muddy current of conversation, and, from continually
mixing with [[society]], they gain, what is termed a [[knowledge]] of the
world; and this acquaintance with manners and customs has
frequently been confounded with a [[knowledge]] of the [[human]] [[heart]].
but can the crude fruit of casual observation, never brought to the
test of [[judgment]], formed by comparing speculation and [[experience]],
deserve such a distinction? soldiers, as well as [[women]], practice
the minor virtues [[virtue]] with punctilious politeness.  where is then the
sexual difference, when the [[education]] has been the same; all the
difference that i can discern, arises from the superior advantage
of [[liberty]] which enables the former to see more of [[life]].

it is wandering from my [[present]] [[subject]], perhaps, to make a
political remark; but as it was produced naturally by the train of
my reflections, i shall not pass it silently over.

standing armies [[army]] can never consist of resolute, robust [[men]]; they may
be well disciplined machines, but they will seldom contain men
under the influence of [[strong]] [[passions]] or with very vigorous
faculties.  and as for any depth of understanding, i will venture
to affirm, that it is as rarely to be found in the [[army]] as amongst
women; and the cause, i maintain, is the same.  it may be further
observed, that officers are also particularly attentive to their
persons, fond of dancing, crowded rooms, adventures, and ridicule.
like the [[fair]] [[sex]], the [[business]] of their lives [[life]] is gallantry.  they
were taught to please, and they only [[live]] to please.  yet they do
not lose their rank in the distinction of sexes [[sex]], for they are still
reckoned superior to [[women]], though in what their superiority
consists, beyond what i have just mentioned, it is difficult to
discover.

the [[great]] misfortune is this, that they both acquire manners before
morals, and a [[knowledge]] of [[life]] before they have from reflection,
any acquaintance with the grand ideal outline of [[human]] [[nature]].  the
consequence is [[natural]]; satisfied with [[common]] [[nature]], they become a
prey to prejudices, and taking all their opinions [[opinion]] on credit, they
blindly submit to [[authority]].  so that if they have any sense, it is
a [[kind]] of instinctive glance, that catches proportions, and decides
with [[respect]] to manners; but fails when arguments are to be pursued
below the surface, or opinions [[opinion]] analyzed.

may not the same remark be applied to [[women]]?  nay, the argument may
be carried still further, for they are both thrown out of a useful
station by the unnatural distinctions established in civilized
life.  riches [[rich]] and hereditary honours [[honour]] have made cyphers of [[women]] to
give consequence to the numerical figure; and idleness has produced
a mixture of gallantry and despotism in [[society]], which leads the
very [[men]] who are the slaves [[slave]] of their mistresses, to tyrannize over
their sisters, wives [[wife]], and daughters [[daughter]].  this is only keeping them in
rank and file, it is true.  strengthen the female [[mind]] by enlarging
it, and there will be an end to blind [[obedience]]; but, as blind
obedience is ever sought for by [[power]], tyrants [[tyrant]] and sensualists are
in the [[right]] when they endeavour to keep [[women]] in the dark, because
the former only want slaves [[slave]], and the latter a play-thing.  the
sensualist, indeed, has been the most dangerous of tyrants [[tyrant]], and
women have been duped by their lovers, as princes [[prince]] by their
ministers, whilst dreaming that they reigned over them.

i now principally allude to [[rousseau]], for his [[character]] of sophia
is, undoubtedly, a captivating one, though it appears to me grossly
unnatural; however, it is not the superstructure, but the
foundation of her [[character]], the principles [[principle]] on which her education
was built, that i mean to attack; nay, warmly as i [[admire]] the
genius of that able writer, whose opinions [[opinion]] i shall often have
occasion to cite, indignation always takes place of admiration, and
the rigid frown of insulted [[virtue]] effaces the smile of
complacency, which his eloquent periods are wont to raise, when i
read his voluptuous reveries.  is this the [[man]], who, in his ardour
for [[virtue]], would banish all the soft [[arts]] of [[peace]], and almost
carry us back to spartan discipline?  is this the [[man]] who delights
to paint the useful struggles of passion, the triumphs of good
dispositions, and the heroic flights which carry the glowing soul
out of itself?  how are these mighty sentiments lowered when he
describes the prettyfoot and enticing airs of his little favourite!
but, for the [[present]], i waive the [[subject]], and, instead of severely
reprehending the transient effusions of overweening sensibility, i
shall only observe, that whoever has cast a benevolent eye on
society, must often have been gratified by the sight of humble
mutual [[love]], not dignified by sentiment, nor strengthened by a
union in intellectual pursuits.  the domestic trifles of the day
have afforded matter for cheerful converse, and [[innocent]] caresses
have softened toils which did not require [[great]] exercise of [[mind]],
or stretch of [[thought]]:  yet, has not the sight of this moderate
felicity excited more tenderness than [[respect]]?  an emotion similar
to what we [[feel]] when [[children]] are playing, or animals sporting,
whilst the contemplation of the [[noble]] struggles of suffering merit
has raised admiration, and carried our thoughts [[thought]] to that [[world]] where
sensation will give place to [[reason]].

women are, therefore, to be considered either as [[moral]] beings, or
so [[weak]] that they must be entirely subjected to the superior
faculties of [[men]].

let us examine this [[question]].  [[rousseau]] declares, that a woman
should never, for a moment [[feel]] herself independent, that she
should be governed by [[fear]] to exercise her [[natural]] cunning, and
made a coquetish [[slave]] in order to render her a more alluring
object of [[desire]], a sweeter companion to [[man]], whenever he chooses
to relax himself.  he carries the arguments, which he pretends to
draw from the indications of [[nature]], still further, and insinuates
that [[truth]] and fortitude the corner stones of all [[human]] [[virtue]],
shall be cultivated with [[certain]] restrictions, because with respect
to the female [[character]], [[obedience]] is the grand lesson which ought
to be impressed with unrelenting rigour.

what nonsense!  when will a [[great]] [[man]] arise with sufficient
strength of [[mind]] to puff away the fumes which [[pride]] and sensuality
have thus spread over the subject!  if [[women]] are by [[nature]] inferior
to [[men]], their virtues [[virtue]] must be the same in quality, if not in
degree, or [[virtue]] is a relative [[idea]]; consequently, their conduct
should be founded on the same principles [[principle]], and have the same aim.

connected with [[man]] as daughters [[daughter]], wives [[wife]], and mothers [[mother]], their moral
character may be estimated by their manner of fulfilling those
simple duties [[duty]]; but the end, the grand end of their exertions should
be to unfold their own faculties, and acquire the [[dignity]] of
conscious [[virtue]].  they may try to render their road pleasant; but
ought never to forget, in [[common]] with [[man]], that [[life]] yields not the
felicity which can satisfy an [[immortal]] [[soul]].  i do not mean to
insinuate, that either [[sex]] should be so lost, in abstract
reflections or distant views, as to forget the affections and
duties that [[lie]] before them, and are, in [[truth]], the means appointed
to [[produce]] the fruit of [[life]]; on the contrary, i would warmly
recommend them, even while i assert, that they afford most
satisfaction when they are considered in their true subordinate
light.

probably the prevailing [[opinion]], that woman was created for [[man]],
may have taken its rise from moses's poetical story; yet, as very
few it is presumed, who have bestowed any serious [[thought]] on the
subject, ever supposed that eve was, literally speaking, one of
adam's ribs, the deduction must be allowed to fall to the ground;
or, only be so far admitted as it proves that [[man]], from the
remotest antiquity, found it convenient to exert his [[strength]] to
subjugate his companion, and his invention to show that she ought
to have her neck bent under the yoke; because she as well as the
brute creation, was created to do his [[pleasure]].

let it not be concluded, that i [[wish]] to invert the order of things;
i have already granted, that, from the [[constitution]] of their
bodies, [[men]] seem to be designed by providence to attain a greater
degree of [[virtue]].  i speak collectively of the whole [[sex]]; but i see
not the shadow of a [[reason]] to conclude that their virtues [[virtue]] should
differ in [[respect]] to their [[nature]].  in [[fact]], how can they, if
virtue has only one eternal standard?  i must, therefore, if i
reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain, that they have the
same simple direction, as that there is a [[god]].

it follows then, that cunning should not be opposed to [[wisdom]],
little cares [[care]] to [[great]] exertions, nor insipid softness, varnished
over with the name of gentleness, to that fortitude which grand
views alone can inspire.

i shall be told, that woman would then lose many of her peculiar
graces, and the [[opinion]] of a well known poet might be quoted to
refute my unqualified assertions.  for [[pope]] has said, in the name
of the whole male [[sex]],

"yet ne'er so sure our [[passions]] to create,
as when she touch'd the brink of all we hate."

in what [[light]] this sally places [[men]] and [[women]], i shall leave to the
judicious to determine; meanwhile i shall content myself with
observing, that i cannot discover why, unless they are mortal,
females should always be degraded by being made subservient to love
or [[lust]].

to speak disrespectfully of [[love]] is, i [[know]], high [[treason]] against
sentiment and fine feelings; but i [[wish]] to speak the simple
language of [[truth]], and rather to address the head than the [[heart]].
to endeavour to [[reason]] [[love]] out of the [[world]], would be to out
quixote cervantes, and equally offend against [[common]] sense; but an
endeavour to restrain this tumultuous passion, and to prove that it
should not be allowed to dethrone superior powers [[power]], or to usurp the
sceptre which the understanding should ever coolly wield, appears
less wild.

youth is the season for [[love]] in both sexes [[sex]]; but in those days of
thoughtless enjoyment, provision should be made for the more
important years of [[life]], when reflection takes place of sensation.
but [[rousseau]], and most of the male writers who have followed his
steps, have warmly inculcated that the whole tendency of female
education ought to be directed to one point to render them
pleasing.

let me [[reason]] with the supporters of this [[opinion]], who have any
knowledge of [[human]] [[nature]], do they imagine that [[marriage]] can
eradicate the habitude of [[life]]?  the woman who has only been taught
to please, will soon find that her charms are oblique sun-beams,
and that they cannot have much effect on her husband's [[heart]] when
they are seen every day, when the summer is [[past]] and gone.  will
she then have sufficient native energy to look into herself for
comfort, and cultivate her dormant faculties? or, is it not more
rational to expect, that she will try to please other [[men]]; and, in
the emotions raised by the expectation of new conquests, endeavour
to forget the mortification her [[love]] or [[pride]] has received?  when
the husband ceases to be a lover--and the [[time]] will inevitably
come, her [[desire]] of pleasing will then grow languid, or become a
spring of bitterness; and [[love]], perhaps, the most evanescent of all
passions, gives place to [[jealousy]] or vanity.

i now speak of [[women]] who are restrained by [[principle]] or prejudice;
such [[women]] though they would shrink from an intrigue with real
abhorrence, yet, nevertheless, [[wish]] to be convinced by the homage
of gallantry, that they are cruelly neglected by their husbands;
or, days and weeks are spent in dreaming of the [[happiness]] enjoyed
by congenial souls [[soul]], till the health is undermined and the spirits
broken by discontent.  how then can the [[great]] art [[arts]] of pleasing be
such a necessary study? it is only useful to a mistress; the chaste
wife, and serious [[mother]], should only consider her [[power]] to please
as the polish of her virtues [[virtue]], and the affection of her husband as
one of the comforts that render her task less difficult, and her
life happier.  but, whether she be loved or neglected, her first
wish should be to make herself respectable, and not rely for all
her [[happiness]] on a being [[subject]] to like infirmities with herself.

the amiable dr. gregory fell into a similar error.  i [[respect]] his
heart; but entirely disapprove of his celebrated legacy to his
daughters.

he advises them to cultivate a fondness for dress, because a
fondness for dress, he asserts, is [[natural]] to them.  i am unable to
comprehend what either he or [[rousseau]] mean, when they frequently
use this indefinite term.  if they told us, that in a pre-existent
state the [[soul]] was fond of dress, and brought this inclination with
it into a new [[body]], i should listen to them with a half smile, as i
often do when i hear a rant about innate elegance.  but if he only
meant to say that the exercise of the faculties will [[produce]] this
fondness, i deny it.  it is not [[natural]]; but arises, like false
ambition in [[men]], from a [[love]] of [[power]].

dr. gregory goes much further; he actually recommends
dissimulation, and advises an [[innocent]] girl to give the [[lie]] to her
feelings, and not dance with spirit, when gaiety of [[heart]] would
make her feet eloquent, without making her gestures immodest.  in
the name of [[truth]] and [[common]] sense, why should not one woman
acknowledge that she can take more exercise than another? or, in
other words, that she has a sound [[constitution]]; and why to damp
innocent vivacity, is she darkly to be told, that [[men]] will draw
conclusions which she little thinks [[think]] of?  let the libertine draw
what inference he pleases; but, i [[hope]], that no sensible mother
will restrain the [[natural]] frankness of [[youth]], by instilling such
indecent cautions.  out of the abundance of the [[heart]] the mouth
speaketh; and a wiser than solomon hath said, that the [[heart]] should
be made clean, and not trivial ceremonies [[ceremony]] observed, which it is not
very difficult to fulfill with scrupulous exactness when vice
reigns in the [[heart]].

women ought to endeavour to purify their hearts [[heart]]; but can they do so
when their uncultivated understandings make them entirely dependent
on their senses for employment and amusement, when no [[noble]] pursuit
sets them above the little vanities of the day, or enables them to
curb the wild emotions that agitate a reed over which every passing
breeze has [[power]]?  to gain the affections of a [[virtuous]] [[man]], is
affectation necessary?

nature has given woman a weaker frame than [[man]]; but, to ensure her
husband's affections, must a [[wife]], who, by the exercise of her mind
and [[body]], whilst she was discharging the duties [[duty]] of a [[daughter]],
wife, and [[mother]], has allowed her [[constitution]] to retain its
natural [[strength]], and her nerves a healthy tone, is she, i say, to
condescend, to use art [[arts]], and feign a sickly delicacy, in order to
secure her husband's affection? weakness may excite tenderness, and
gratify the arrogant [[pride]] of [[man]]; but the lordly caresses of a
protector will not gratify a [[noble]] [[mind]] that pants for and deserves
to be respected.  fondness is a [[poor]] substitute for friendship!

in a seraglio, i grant, that all these [[arts]] are necessary; the
epicure must have his palate tickled, or he will sink into apathy;
but have [[women]] so little [[ambition]] as to be satisfied with such a
condition?  can they supinely [[dream]] [[life]] away in the lap of
pleasure, or in the languor of weariness, rather than assert their
claim to pursue reasonable pleasures [[pleasure]], and render themselves
conspicuous, by practising the virtues [[virtue]] which dignify [[mankind]]?
surely she has not an [[immortal]] [[soul]] who can loiter [[life]] away,
merely employed to adorn her [[person]], that she may amuse the languid
hours, and soften the cares [[care]] of a fellow-creature who is willing to
be enlivened by her smiles and tricks, when the serious [[business]] of
life is over.

besides, the woman who strengthens her [[body]] and exercises her mind
will, by managing her [[family]] and practising various virtues [[virtue]], become
the friend, and not the humble dependent of her husband; and if she
deserves his regard by possessing such substantial qualities, she
will not find it necessary to conceal her affection, nor to pretend
to an unnatural coldness of [[constitution]] to excite her husband's
passions.  in [[fact]], if we revert to [[history]], we shall find that the
women who have distinguished themselves have neither been the most
beautiful nor the most gentle of their [[sex]].

nature, or to speak with strict propriety [[god]], has made all things
right; but [[man]] has sought him out many inventions to mar the [[work]].
i now allude to that part of dr. gregory's treatise, where he
advises a [[wife]] never to let her husband [[know]] the extent of her
sensibility or affection.  voluptuous precaution; and as
ineffectual as absurd.  [[love]], from its very [[nature]], must be
transitory.  to seek for a secret that would render it constant,
would be as wild a search as for the philosopher's stone, or the
grand panacea; and the discovery would be equally useless, or
rather pernicious to [[mankind]].  the most holy band of [[society]] is
friendship.  it has been well said, by a shrewd satirist, "that
rare as true [[love]] is, true [[friendship]] is still rarer."

this is an obvious [[truth]], and the cause not lying deep, will not
elude a slight glance of inquiry.

love, the [[common]] passion, in which [[chance]] and sensation take place
of [[choice]] and [[reason]], is in some [[degree]], [[felt]] by the mass of
mankind; for it is not necessary to speak, at [[present]], of the
emotions that rise above or sink below [[love]].  this passion,
naturally increased by suspense and difficulties, draws the mind
out of its accustomed [[state]], and exalts the affections; but the
security of [[marriage]], allowing the fever of [[love]] to subside, a
healthy temperature is [[thought]] insipid, only by those who have not
sufficient [[intellect]] to substitute the calm tenderness of
friendship, the confidence of [[respect]], instead of blind admiration,
and the sensual emotions of fondness.

this is, must be, the course of nature--friendship or indifference
inevitably succeeds [[love]].  and this [[constitution]] seems perfectly to
harmonize with the [[system]] of [[government]] which prevails in the moral
world.  [[passions]] are spurs to action, and open the [[mind]]; but they
sink into mere appetites, become a personal momentary
gratification, when the object is gained, and the satisfied mind
rests in enjoyment.  the [[man]] who had some [[virtue]] whilst he was
struggling for a [[crown]], often becomes a voluptuous [[tyrant]] when it
graces his brow; and, when the lover is not lost in the husband,
the dotard a prey to childish caprices, and fond jealousies,
neglects the serious duties [[duty]] of [[life]], and the caresses which should
excite confidence in his [[children]] are lavished on the overgrown
child, his [[wife]].

in order to fulfil the duties [[duty]] of [[life]], and to be able to pursue
with vigour the various employments which form the [[moral]] [[character]],
a master and mistress of a [[family]] ought not to continue to love
each other with passion.  i mean to say, that they ought not to
indulge those emotions which disturb the order of [[society]], and
engross the thoughts [[thought]] that should be otherwise employed.  the mind
that has never been engrossed by one object wants vigour--if it can
long be so, it is [[weak]].

a mistaken [[education]], a narrow, uncultivated [[mind]], and many sexual
prejudices, tend to make [[women]] more constant than [[men]]; but, for the
present, i shall not touch on this branch of the [[subject]].  i will
go still further, and advance, without dreaming of a paradox, that
an unhappy [[marriage]] is often very advantageous to a [[family]], and
that the neglected [[wife]] is, in general, the [[best]] [[mother]].  and this
would almost always be the consequence, if the female [[mind]] was more
enlarged; for, it seems to be the [[common]] dispensation of
providence, that what we gain in [[present]] enjoyment should be
deducted from the treasure of [[life]], [[experience]]; and that when we
are gathering the flowers of the day and revelling in [[pleasure]], the
solid fruit of toil and [[wisdom]] should not be caught at the same
time.  the way lies [[lie]] before us, we must turn to the [[right]] or left;
and he who will pass [[life]] away in bounding from one [[pleasure]] to
another, must not [[complain]] if he neither acquires [[wisdom]] nor
respectability of [[character]].

supposing for a moment, that the [[soul]] is not [[immortal]], and that man
was only created for the [[present]] scene; i [[think]] we should have
reason to [[complain]] that [[love]], infantine fondness, ever grew insipid
and palled upon the sense.  let us [[eat]], drink, and [[love]], for
to-morrow we [[die]], would be in [[fact]] the [[language]] of [[reason]], the
morality of [[life]]; and who but a [[fool]] would part with a reality for
a fleeting shadow?  but, if awed by observing the improvable powers
of the [[mind]], we disdain to confine our wishes [[wish]] or thoughts [[thought]] to such a
comparatively mean field of action; that only appears grand and
important as it is connected with a boundless prospect and sublime
hopes; what necessity is there for falsehood in conduct, and why
must the [[sacred]] majesty of [[truth]] be violated to detain a deceitful
good that saps the very foundation of [[virtue]]?  why must the female
mind be tainted by coquetish [[arts]] to gratify the sensualist, and
prevent [[love]] from subsiding into [[friendship]] or compassionate
tenderness, when there are not qualities on which [[friendship]] can be
built?  let the honest [[heart]] show itself, and [[reason]] [[teach]] passion
to submit to necessity; or, let the dignified pursuit of [[virtue]] and
knowledge raise the [[mind]] above those emotions which rather imbitter
than sweeten the cup of [[life]], when they are not restrained within
due bounds.

i do not mean to allude to the romantic passion, which is the
concomitant of genius.  who can clip its wings?  but that grand
passion not proportioned to the puny enjoyments of [[life]], is only
true to the sentiment, and feeds on itself.  the [[passions]] which
have been celebrated for their durability have always been
unfortunate.  they have acquired [[strength]] by absence and
constitutional melancholy.  the fancy has hovered round a form of
beauty dimly seen--but familiarity might have turned admiration
into disgust; or, at least, into indifference, and allowed the
imagination leisure to start fresh game.  with [[perfect]] propriety,
according to this view of things, does [[rousseau]] make the mistress
of his [[soul]], eloisa, [[love]] st. preux, when [[life]] was fading before
her; but this is no proof of the immortality of the passion.

of the same [[complexion]] is dr. gregory's [[advice]] respecting delicacy
of sentiment, which he advises a woman not to acquire, if she has
determined to [[marry]].  this determination, however, perfectly
consistent with his former [[advice]], he calls indelicate, and
earnestly persuades his daughters [[daughter]] to conceal it, though it may
govern their conduct:  as if it were indelicate to have the common
appetites of [[human]] [[nature]].

noble morality! and consistent with the cautious prudence of a
little [[soul]] that cannot extend its views beyond the [[present]] minute
division of existence.  if all the faculties of woman's [[mind]] are
only to be cultivated as they [[respect]] her dependence on [[man]]; if,
when she obtains a husband she has arrived at her goal, and meanly
proud, is satisfied with such a paltry [[crown]], let her grovel
contentedly, scarcely raised by her employments above the animal
kingdom; but, if she is struggling for the prize of her high
calling, let her cultivate her understanding without stopping to
consider what [[character]] the husband may have whom she is destined
to [[marry]].  let her only determine, without being too anxious about
present [[happiness]], to acquire the qualities that ennoble a rational
being, and a rough, inelegant husband may shock her taste without
destroying her [[peace]] of [[mind]].  she will not model her [[soul]] to suit
the frailties of her companion, but to bear with them:  his
character may be a [[trial]], but not an impediment to [[virtue]].

if dr. gregory confined his remark to romantic expectations of
constant [[love]] and congenial feelings, he should have recollected,
that [[experience]] will banish what [[advice]] can never make us cease to
wish for, when the [[imagination]] is kept alive at the expence of
reason.

i own it frequently happens, that [[women]] who have fostered a
romantic unnatural delicacy of feeling, waste their lives [[life]] in
imagining how [[happy]] they should have been with a husband who could
love them with a fervid increasing affection every day, and all
day.  but they might as well pine [[married]] as [[single]], and would not
be a jot more unhappy with a [[bad]] husband than longing for a good
one.  that a proper [[education]]; or, to speak with more precision, a
well stored [[mind]], would enable a woman to support a [[single]] life
with [[dignity]], i grant; but that she should avoid cultivating her
taste, lest her husband should occasionally shock it, is quitting a
substance for a shadow.  to say the [[truth]], i do not [[know]] of what
use is an improved taste, if the [[individual]] be not rendered more
independent of the casualties of [[life]]; if new sources of enjoyment,
only dependent on the solitary operations of the [[mind]], are not
opened.  [[people]] of taste, [[married]] or [[single]], without distinction,
will ever be disgusted by various things that touch not less
observing minds [[mind]].  on this conclusion the argument must not be
allowed to hinge; but in the whole sum of enjoyment is taste to be
denominated a blessing?

the [[question]] is, whether it procures most [[pain]] or [[pleasure]]?  the
answer will decide the propriety of dr. gregory's [[advice]], and show
how absurd and tyrannic it is thus to lay down a [[system]] of [[slavery]];
or to attempt to educate [[moral]] beings by any other rules [[rule]] than those
deduced from pure [[reason]], which apply to the whole [[species]].

gentleness of manners, forbearance, and long suffering, are such
amiable godlike qualities, that in sublime poetic strains the deity
has been invested with them; and, perhaps, no representation of his
goodness so strongly fastens on the [[human]] affections as those that
represent him abundant in [[mercy]] and willing to pardon.  gentleness,
considered in this point of view, bears on its front all the
characteristics of grandeur, combined with the winning graces of
condescension; but what a different aspect it assumes when it is
the submissive demeanour of dependence, the support of weakness
that loves [[love]], because it wants protection; and is forbearing, because
it must silently endure injuries; smiling under the lash at which
it dare not snarl.  abject as this picture appears, it is the
portrait of an accomplished woman, according to the received
opinion of female excellence, separated by specious reasoners from
human excellence.  or, they (vide [[rousseau]], and swedenborg) kindly
restore the rib, and make one [[moral]] being of a [[man]] and woman; not
forgetting to give her all the "submissive charms."

how [[women]] are to [[exist]] in that [[state]] where there is to be neither
marrying nor giving in [[marriage]], we are not told.  for though
moralists have agreed, that the tenor of [[life]] seems to prove that
man is prepared by various circumstances for a future [[state]], they
constantly concur in advising woman only to provide for the
present.  gentleness, docility, and a spaniel-like affection are,
on this ground, consistently recommended as the cardinal virtues [[virtue]] of
the [[sex]]; and, disregarding the arbitrary economy of [[nature]], one
writer has declared that it is masculine for a woman to be
melancholy.  she was created to be the toy of [[man]], his rattle, and
it must jingle in his ears, whenever, dismissing [[reason]], he chooses
to be amused.

to recommend gentleness, indeed, on a broad basis is strictly
philosophical.  a frail being should [[labour]] to be gentle.  but when
forbearance confounds [[right]] and [[wrong]], it ceases to be a [[virtue]];
and, however convenient it may be found in a companion, that
companion will ever be considered as an inferior, and only inspire
a vapid tenderness, which easily degenerates into contempt.  still,
if [[advice]] could really make a being gentle, whose natural
disposition admitted not of such a fine polish, something toward
the advancement of order would be attained; but if, as might
quickly be demonstrated, only affectation be produced by this
indiscriminate counsel, which throws a stumbling block in the way
of gradual improvement, and true melioration of temper, the [[sex]] is
not much benefited by sacrificing solid virtues [[virtue]] to the attainment
of superficial graces, though for a few years they may procure the
individual's regal sway.

as a philosopher, i [[read]] with indignation the plausible epithets
which [[men]] use to soften their insults; and, as a moralist, i ask
what is meant by such heterogeneous associations, as [[fair]] defects,
amiable weaknesses, etc.? if there is but one criterion of morals [[moral]],
but one archetype for [[man]], [[women]] appear to be suspended by [[destiny]],
according to the vulgar tale of mahomet's coffin; they have neither
the unerring instinct of brutes, nor are allowed to fix the eye of
reason on a [[perfect]] model.  they were made to be loved, and must
not aim at [[respect]], lest they should be hunted out of [[society]] as
masculine.

but to view the [[subject]] in another point of view.  do passive
indolent [[women]] make the [[best]] wives [[wife]]?  confining our discussion to
the [[present]] moment of existence, let us see how such [[weak]] creatures
perform their part?  do the [[women]] who, by the attainment of a few
superficial accomplishments, have strengthened the prevailing
prejudice, merely contribute to the [[happiness]] of their husbands?
do they display their charms merely to amuse them?  and have [[women]],
who have early imbibed notions of passive [[obedience]], sufficient
character to manage a [[family]] or educate [[children]]?  so far from it,
that, after surveying the [[history]] of woman, i cannot [[help]] agreeing
with the severest satirist, considering the [[sex]] as the weakest as
well as the most [[oppressed]] half of the [[species]].  what does history
disclose but marks of inferiority, and how few [[women]] have
emancipated themselves from the galling yoke of [[sovereign]] [[man]]?  so
few, that the exceptions remind me of an ingenious conjecture
respecting newton:  that he was probably a being of a superior
order, accidentally caged in a [[human]] [[body]].  in the same style i
have been [[led]] to imagine that the few extraordinary [[women]] who have
rushed in eccentrical directions out of the orbit prescribed to
their [[sex]], were male spirits, confined by mistake in a female
frame.  but if it be not philosophical to [[think]] of [[sex]] when the
soul is mentioned, the inferiority must depend on the organs; or
the heavenly [[fire]], which is to ferment the clay, is not given in
equal portions.

but avoiding, as i have hitherto done, any direct comparison of the
two sexes [[sex]] collectively, or frankly acknowledging the inferiority of
woman, according to the [[present]] appearance of things, i shall only
insist, that [[men]] have increased that inferiority till [[women]] are
almost sunk below the standard of [[rational]] creatures.  let their
faculties have room to unfold, and their virtues [[virtue]] to gain [[strength]],
and then determine where the whole [[sex]] must stand in the
intellectual scale.  yet, let it be remembered, that for a small
number of distinguished [[women]] i do not ask a place.

it is difficult for us purblind mortals to say to what height human
discoveries and improvements may arrive, when the gloom of
despotism subsides, which makes us stumble at every step; but, when
morality shall be settled on a more solid basis, then, without
being gifted with a prophetic spirit, i will venture to predict,
that woman will be either the friend or [[slave]] of [[man]].  we shall
not, as at [[present]], [[doubt]] whether she is a [[moral]] agent, or the link
which unites [[man]] with brutes.  but, should it then appear, that
like the brutes they were principally created for the use of [[man]],
he will let them patiently bite the bridle, and not mock them with
empty [[praise]]; or, should their rationality be proved, he will not
impede their improvement merely to gratify his sensual appetites.
he will not with all the graces of rhetoric, advise them to submit
implicitly their understandings to the guidance of [[man]].  he will
not, when he treats of the [[education]] of [[women]], assert, that they
ought never to have the [[free]] use of [[reason]], nor would he recommend
cunning and dissimulation to beings who are acquiring, in like
manner as himself, the virtues [[virtue]] of [[humanity]].

surely there can be but one [[rule]] of [[right]], if morality has an
eternal foundation, and whoever sacrifices [[sacrifice]] [[virtue]], strictly so
called, to [[present]] convenience, or whose [[duty]] it is to act in such
a manner, lives [[life]] only for the passing day, and cannot be an
accountable creature.

the poet then should have dropped his sneer when he says,

"if [[weak]] [[women]] go astray,
the stars are more in [[fault]] than they."

for that they are bound by the adamantine chain of [[destiny]] is most
certain, if it be proved that they are never to exercise their own
reason, never to be independent, never to rise above [[opinion]], or to
feel the [[dignity]] of a [[rational]] will that only bows to [[god]], and
often forgets that the [[universe]] contains any being but itself, and
the model of [[perfection]] to which its ardent gaze is turned, to
adore attributes that, softened into virtues [[virtue]], may be imitated in
kind, though the [[degree]] overwhelms the enraptured [[mind]].

if, i say, for i would not impress by declamation when reason
offers her sober [[light]], if they are really capable of acting like
rational creatures, let them not be treated like slaves [[slave]]; or, like
the brutes who are dependent on the [[reason]] of [[man]], when they
associate with him; but cultivate their minds [[mind]], give them the
salutary, sublime curb of [[principle]], and let them attain conscious
dignity by feeling themselves only dependent on [[god]].  [[teach]] them,
in [[common]] with [[man]], to submit to necessity, instead of giving, to
render them more pleasing, a [[sex]] to morals [[moral]].

further, should [[experience]] prove that they cannot attain the same
degree of [[strength]] of [[mind]], perseverance and fortitude, let their
virtues be the same in [[kind]], though they may vainly struggle for
the same [[degree]]; and the superiority of [[man]] will be equally clear,
if not clearer; and [[truth]], as it is a simple [[principle]], which
admits of no modification, would be [[common]] to both.  nay, the order
of [[society]], as it is at [[present]] regulated, would not be inverted,
for woman would then only have the rank that [[reason]] assigned her,
and [[arts]] could not be practised to bring the balance even, much
less to turn it.

these may be termed utopian dreams [[dream]].  thanks to that being who
impressed them on my [[soul]], and gave me sufficient [[strength]] of mind
to dare to exert my own [[reason]], till becoming dependent only on him
for the support of my [[virtue]], i view with indignation, the mistaken
notions that enslave my [[sex]].

i [[love]] [[man]] as my fellow; but his sceptre real or usurped, extends
not to me, unless the [[reason]] of an [[individual]] demands my homage;
and even then the submission is to [[reason]], and not to [[man]].  in
fact, the conduct of an accountable being must be regulated by the
operations of its own [[reason]]; or on what foundation rests the
throne of [[god]]?

it appears to me necessary to dwell on these obvious truths [[truth]],
because females have been insulted, as it were; and while they have
been stripped of the virtues [[virtue]] that should clothe [[humanity]], they have
been decked with artificial graces, that enable them to exercise a
short lived [[tyranny]].  [[love]], in their bosoms, taking place of every
nobler passion, their sole [[ambition]] is to be [[fair]], to raise emotion
instead of inspiring [[respect]]; and this ignoble [[desire]], like the
servility in absolute monarchies [[monarchy]], destroys all [[strength]] of
character.  [[liberty]] is the [[mother]] of [[virtue]], and if [[women]] are, by
their very [[constitution]], slaves [[slave]], and not allowed to breathe the
sharp invigorating air of [[freedom]], they must ever languish like
exotics, and be reckoned beautiful flaws in [[nature]]; let it also be
remembered, that they are the only flaw.

as to the argument respecting the subjection in which the [[sex]] has
ever been held, it retorts on [[man]].  the many have always been
enthralled by the few; and, monsters who have scarcely shown any
discernment of [[human]] excellence, have tyrannized over thousands of
their fellow creatures.  why have [[men]] of superior endowments
submitted to such degradation?  for, is it not universally
acknowledged that kings [[king]], viewed collectively, have ever been
inferior, in abilities and [[virtue]], to the same number of [[men]] taken
from the [[common]] mass of mankind--yet, have they not, and are they
not still treated with a [[degree]] of reverence, that is an insult to
reason?  [[china]] is not the only [[country]] where a living [[man]] has been
made a [[god]].  [[men]] have submitted to superior [[strength]], to enjoy with
impunity the [[pleasure]] of the moment--women have only done the same,
and therefore till it is proved that the courtier, who servilely
resigns the birthright of a [[man]], is not a [[moral]] agent, it cannot be
demonstrated that woman is essentially inferior to [[man]], because she
has always been subjugated.

brutal [[force]] has hitherto governed the [[world]], and that the science
of [[politics]] is in its infancy, is evident from philosophers
scrupling to give the [[knowledge]] most useful to [[man]] that determinate
distinction.

i shall not pursue this argument any further than to establish an
obvious inference, that as sound [[politics]] diffuse [[liberty]], [[mankind]],
including woman, will become more [[wise]] and [[virtuous]].


chapter 3.

the same [[subject]] continued.

bodily [[strength]] from being the distinction of heroes is now sunk
into such unmerited contempt, that [[men]] as well as [[women]], seem to
think it unnecessary:  the latter, as it takes from their feminine
graces, and from that lovely weakness, the source of their undue
power; and the former, because it appears inimical with the
character of a gentleman.

that they have both by departing from one extreme run into another,
may easily be proved; but it first may be proper to observe, that a
vulgar error has obtained a [[degree]] of credit, which has given force
to a false conclusion, in which an effect has been mistaken for a
cause.

people of genius have, very frequently, impaired their
constitutions by study, or careless inattention to their health,
and the [[violence]] of their [[passions]] bearing a proportion to the
vigour of their intellects, the sword's destroying the scabbard has
become almost proverbial, and superficial observers have inferred
from thence, that [[men]] of genius have commonly [[weak]], or to use a
more fashionable phrase, delicate constitutions [[constitution]].  yet the contrary,
i [[believe]], will appear to be the [[fact]]; for, on diligent inquiry, i
find that [[strength]] of [[mind]] has, in most cases, been accompanied by
superior [[strength]] of [[body]], [[natural]] soundness of [[constitution]], not
that robust tone of nerves and vigour of muscles, which arise from
bodily [[labour]], when the [[mind]] is quiescent, or only directs the
hands.

dr. priestley has remarked, in the preface to his biographical
chart, that the majority of [[great]] [[men]] have lived beyond forty-five.
and, considering the thoughtless manner in which they lavished
their [[strength]], when investigating a favourite [[science]], they have
wasted the lamp of [[life]], forgetful of the midnight hour; or, when,
lost in poetic dreams [[dream]], fancy has peopled the scene, and the soul
has been disturbed, till it shook the [[constitution]], by the passions
that meditation had raised; whose objects, the baseless fabric of a
vision, faded before the exhausted eye, they must have had iron
frames.  shakespeare never grasped the airy dagger with a nerveless
hand, nor did milton tremble when he [[led]] [[satan]] far from the
confines of his dreary prison.  these were not the ravings of
imbecility, the sickly effusions of distempered brains; but the
exuberance of fancy, that "in a fine phrenzy" wandering, was not
continually reminded of its material shackles.

i am aware, that this argument would carry me further than it may
be supposed i [[wish]] to go; but i [[follow]] [[truth]], and still adhering to
my first position, i will allow that bodily [[strength]] seems to give
man a [[natural]] superiority over woman; and this is the only solid
basis on which the superiority of the [[sex]] can be built.  but i
still insist, that not only the [[virtue]], but the [[knowledge]] of the
two sexes [[sex]] should be the same in [[nature]], if not in [[degree]], and that
women, considered not only as [[moral]], but [[rational]] creatures, ought
to endeavour to acquire [[human]] virtues [[virtue]] (or perfections) by the same
means as [[men]], instead of being educated like a fanciful [[kind]] of
half being, one of rousseau's wild chimeras.

but, if [[strength]] of [[body]] be, with some show of [[reason]], the boast of
men, why are [[women]] so infatuated as to be proud of a defect?
rousseau has furnished them with a plausible excuse, which could
only have occurred to a [[man]], whose [[imagination]] had been allowed to
run wild, and refine on the impressions made by exquisite senses,
that they might, forsooth have a pretext for yielding to a natural
appetite without violating a romantic [[species]] of modesty, which
gratifies the [[pride]] and libertinism of [[man]].

women deluded by these sentiments, sometimes boast of their
weakness, cunningly obtaining [[power]] by playing on the weakness of
men; and they may well [[glory]] in their illicit sway, for, like
turkish bashaws, they have more real [[power]] than their masters:  but
virtue is sacrificed to temporary gratifications, and the
respectability of [[life]] to the triumph of an hour.

women, as well as despots, have now, perhaps, more [[power]] than they
would have, if the [[world]], divided and subdivided into kingdoms [[kingdom]] and
families, was governed by laws [[law]] deduced from the exercise of [[reason]];
but in obtaining it, to carry on the comparison, their [[character]] is
degraded, and licentiousness spread through the whole aggregate of
society.  the many become pedestal to the few.  i, therefore will
venture to assert, that till [[women]] are more rationally educated,
the [[progress]] of [[human]] [[virtue]] and improvement in [[knowledge]] must
receive continual checks.  and if it be granted, that woman was not
created merely to gratify the appetite of [[man]], nor to be the upper
servant, who provides his meals and takes [[care]] of his linen, it
must [[follow]], that the first [[care]] of those mothers [[mother]] or fathers [[father]], who
really attend to the [[education]] of females, should be, if not to
strengthen the [[body]], at least, not to [[destroy]] the [[constitution]] by
mistaken notions of [[beauty]] and female excellence; nor should girls
ever be allowed to imbibe the pernicious notion that a defect can,
by any chemical process of reasoning become an excellence.  in this
respect, i am [[happy]] to find, that the author of one of the most
instructive books [[book]], that our [[country]] has produced for [[children]],
coincides with me in [[opinion]]; i shall quote his pertinent remarks
to give the [[force]] of his respectable [[authority]] to [[reason]].*

(*footnote.  a respectable old [[man]] gives the following sensible
account of the method he pursued when educating his [[daughter]].  "i
endeavoured to give both to her [[mind]] and [[body]] a [[degree]] of vigour,
which is seldom found in the female [[sex]].  as soon as she was
sufficiently advanced in [[strength]] to be capable of the lighter
labours of husbandry and gardening, i employed her as my constant
companion.  selene, for that was her name, soon acquired a
dexterity in all these rustic employments which i considered with
equal [[pleasure]] and admiration.  if [[women]] are in general feeble both
in [[body]] and [[mind]], it arises less from [[nature]] than from [[education]].
we encourage a vicious indolence and inactivity, which we falsely
call delicacy; instead of hardening their minds [[mind]] by the severer
principles of [[reason]] and [[philosophy]], we breed them to useless [[arts]],
which terminate in vanity and sensuality.  in most of the countries
which i had visited, they are taught nothing of an higher nature
than a few modulations of the voice, or useless postures of the
body; their [[time]] is consumed in sloth or trifles, and trifles
become the only pursuits capable of interesting them.  we seem to
forget, that it is upon the qualities of the female [[sex]], that our
own domestic comforts and the [[education]] of our [[children]] must
depend.  and what are the comforts or the [[education]] which a [[race]] of
beings corrupted from their infancy, and unacquainted with all the
duties of [[life]], are fitted to bestow?  to touch a musical
instrument with useless [[skill]], to exhibit their [[natural]] or affected
graces, to the [[eyes]] of indolent and debauched [[young]] [[men]], who
dissipate their husbands' patrimony in riotous and unnecessary
expenses:  these are the only [[arts]] cultivated by [[women]] in most of
the polished nations i had seen.  and the consequences are
uniformly such as may be expected to proceed from such polluted
sources, private misery, and [[public]] servitude.

"but, selene's [[education]] was regulated by different views, and
conducted upon severer principles [[principle]]; if that can be called severity
which opens the [[mind]] to a sense of [[moral]] and [[religious]] duties [[duty]], and
most effectually arms it against the inevitable evils [[evil]] of
life."--mr. day's "sandford and merton," volume 3.)

but should it be proved that woman is naturally weaker than [[man]],
from whence does it [[follow]] that it is [[natural]] for her to [[labour]] to
become still weaker than [[nature]] intended her to be?  arguments of
this cast are an insult to [[common]] sense, and savour of passion.
the [[divine]] [[right]] of husbands, like the [[divine]] [[right]] of kings [[king]], may,
it is to be hoped, in this enlightened [[age]], be contested without
danger, and though conviction may not [[silence]] many boisterous
disputants, yet, when any prevailing prejudice is attacked, the
wise will consider, and leave the narrow-minded to rail with
thoughtless vehemence at innovation.

the [[mother]], who wishes [[wish]] to give true [[dignity]] of [[character]] to her
daughter, must, regardless of the sneers of ignorance, proceed on a
plan diametrically opposite to that which [[rousseau]] has recommended
with all the deluding charms of eloquence and philosophical
sophistry:  for his eloquence renders absurdities plausible, and
his dogmatic conclusions puzzle, without convincing those who have
not ability to refute them.

throughout the whole animal [[kingdom]] every [[young]] creature requires
almost continual exercise, and the infancy of [[children]], conformable
to this intimation, should be passed in harmless gambols, that
exercise the feet and hands, without requiring very minute
direction from the head, or the constant attention of a nurse.  in
fact, the [[care]] necessary for self-preservation is the first natural
exercise of the understanding, as little inventions to amuse the
present moment unfold the [[imagination]].  but these [[wise]] designs of
nature are counteracted by mistaken fondness or blind zeal.  the
child is not left a moment to its own direction, particularly a
girl, and thus rendered dependent--dependence is called [[natural]].

to preserve personal [[beauty]], woman's glory! the limbs and faculties
are cramped with worse than chinese bands, and the sedentary life
which they are condemned to [[live]], whilst boys frolic in the open
air, weakens the muscles and relaxes the nerves.  as for rousseau's
remarks, which have since been echoed by several writers, that they
have naturally, that is from their birth, independent of [[education]],
a fondness for dolls, dressing, and talking, they are so puerile as
not to [[merit]] a serious refutation.  that a girl, condemned to sit
for hours together listening to the idle chat of [[weak]] nurses or to
attend at her mother's toilet, will endeavour to join the
conversation, is, indeed very [[natural]]; and that she will imitate
her [[mother]] or aunts, and amuse herself by adorning her lifeless
doll, as they do in dressing her, [[poor]] [[innocent]] babe! is
undoubtedly a most [[natural]] consequence.  for [[men]] of the greatest
abilities have seldom had sufficient [[strength]] to rise above the
surrounding atmosphere; and, if the page of genius has always been
blurred by the prejudices of the [[age]], some allowance should be made
for a [[sex]], who, like kings [[king]], always see things through a false
medium.

in this manner may the fondness for dress, conspicuous in [[women]], be
easily accounted for, without supposing it the result of a desire
to please the [[sex]] on which they are dependent.  the absurdity, in
short, of supposing that a girl is naturally a coquette, and that a
desire connected with the impulse of [[nature]] to propagate the
species, should appear even before an improper [[education]] has, by
heating the [[imagination]], called it forth prematurely, is so
unphilosophical, that such a sagacious observer as [[rousseau]] would
not have adopted it, if he had not been accustomed to make reason
give way to his [[desire]] of singularity, and [[truth]] to a favourite
paradox.

yet thus to give a [[sex]] to [[mind]] was not very consistent with the
principles of a [[man]] who argued so warmly, and so well, for the
immortality of the [[soul]].  but what a [[weak]] barrier is [[truth]] when it
stands in the way of an hypothesis!  [[rousseau]] respected--almost
adored virtue--and yet allowed himself to [[love]] with sensual
fondness.  his [[imagination]] constantly prepared inflammable fuel for
his inflammable senses; but, in order to reconcile his [[respect]] for
self-denial, fortitude and those heroic virtues [[virtue]], which a [[mind]] like
his could not coolly [[admire]], he labours [[labour]] to invert the [[law]] of
nature, and broaches a doctrine pregnant with mischief, and
derogatory to the [[character]] of supreme [[wisdom]].

his ridiculous stories, which tend to prove that girls are
naturally attentive to their persons [[person]], without laying any stress on
daily [[example]], are below contempt.  and that a little miss should
have such a [[correct]] taste as to neglect the pleasing amusement of
making o's, merely because she perceived that it was an ungraceful
attitude, should be selected with the anecdotes of the learned
pig.*

(*footnote.  "i once knew a [[young]] [[person]] who learned to write
before she learned to [[read]], and began to write with her needle
before she could use a pen.  at first indeed, she took it into her
head to make no other letter than the o:  this letter she was
constantly making of all sizes, and always the [[wrong]] way.
unluckily one day, as she was intent on this employment, she
happened to see herself in the looking glass; when, taking a
dislike to the constrained attitude in which she sat while writing,
she threw away her pen, like another pallas, and determined against
making the o any more.  her [[brother]] was also equally averse to
writing:  it was the confinement, however, and not the constrained
attitude, that most disgusted him."
rousseau's "emilius.")

i have, probably, had an opportunity of observing more girls in
their infancy than j. j. [[rousseau]].  i can recollect my own
feelings, and i have looked steadily around me; yet, so far from
coinciding with him in [[opinion]] respecting the first dawn of the
female [[character]], i will venture to affirm, that a girl, whose
spirits have not been damped by inactivity, or innocence tainted by
false shame, will always be a romp, and the doll will never excite
attention unless confinement allows her no alternative.  girls and
boys, in short, would play harmless together, if the distinction of
sex was not inculcated long before [[nature]] makes any difference.  i
will, go further, and affirm, as an indisputable [[fact]], that most of
the [[women]], in the circle of my observation, who have acted like
rational creatures, or shown any vigour of [[intellect]], have
accidentally been allowed to run wild, as some of the elegant
formers of the [[fair]] [[sex]] would insinuate.

the baneful consequences which flow from inattention to health
during infancy, and [[youth]], extend further than is supposed,
dependence of [[body]] naturally produces [[produce]] dependence of [[mind]]; and how
can she be a [[good]] [[wife]] or [[mother]], the greater part of whose [[time]] is
employed to guard against or endure sickness; nor can it be
expected, that a woman will resolutely endeavour to strengthen her
constitution and abstain from enervating indulgences, if artificial
notions of [[beauty]], and false descriptions of sensibility, have been
early entangled with her motives of action.  most [[men]] are sometimes
obliged to bear with bodily inconveniences, and to endure,
occasionally, the inclemency of the elements; but genteel women
are, literally speaking, slaves [[slave]] to their bodies [[body]], and [[glory]] in their
subjection.

i once knew a [[weak]] woman of [[fashion]], who was more than commonly
proud of her delicacy and sensibility.  she [[thought]] a
distinguishing taste and puny appetite the height of all human
perfection, and acted accordingly.  i have seen this weak
sophisticated being neglect all the duties [[duty]] of [[life]], yet recline
with self-complacency on a sofa, and boast of her want of appetite
as a proof of delicacy that extended to, or, perhaps, arose from,
her exquisite sensibility:  for it is difficult to render
intelligible such ridiculous jargon.  yet, at the moment, i have
seen her insult a worthy old gentlewoman, whom unexpected
misfortunes had made dependent on her ostentatious bounty, and who,
in [[better]] days, had claims on her gratitude.  is it possible that a
human creature should have become such a [[weak]] and depraved being,
if, like the sybarites, dissolved in luxury, every thing like
virtue had not been worn away, or never impressed by precept, a
poor substitute it is true, for cultivation of [[mind]], though it
serves as a fence against [[vice]]?

such a woman is not a more irrational monster than some of the
roman emperors [[emperor]], who were depraved by lawless [[power]].  yet, since
kings have been more under the restraint of [[law]], and the curb,
however [[weak]], of [[honour]], the records of [[history]] are not filled with
such unnatural instances of folly and [[cruelty]], nor does the
despotism that kills [[virtue]] and genius in the bud, hover over
europe with that destructive blast which desolates turkey, and
renders the [[men]], as well as the soil unfruitful.

women are every where in this deplorable [[state]]; for, in order to
preserve their innocence, as ignorance is courteously termed, truth
is hidden from them, and they are made to assume an artificial
character before their faculties have acquired any [[strength]].
taught from their infancy, that [[beauty]] is woman's sceptre, the mind
shapes itself to the [[body]], and, roaming round its gilt cage, only
seeks to adorn its prison.  [[men]] have various employments and
pursuits which engage their attention, and give a [[character]] to the
opening [[mind]]; but [[women]], confined to one, and having their thoughts
constantly directed to the most insignificant part of themselves,
seldom extend their views beyond the triumph of the hour.  but was
their understanding once emancipated from the [[slavery]] to which the
pride and sensuality of [[man]] and their short sighted [[desire]], like
that of dominion in tyrants [[tyrant]], of [[present]] sway, has subjected them,
we should probably [[read]] of their weaknesses with surprise.  i must
be allowed to pursue the argument a little farther.

perhaps, if the existence of an [[evil]] being was allowed, who, in the
allegorical [[language]] of [[scripture]], went about seeking whom he
should devour, he could not more effectually degrade the human
character than by giving a [[man]] absolute [[power]].

this argument branches into various ramifications.  birth, riches [[rich]],
and every intrinsic advantage that exalt a [[man]] above his fellows,
without any mental exertion, sink him in reality below them.  in
proportion to his weakness, he is played upon by designing [[men]],
till the bloated monster has lost all traces of [[humanity]].  and that
tribes of [[men]], like flocks of sheep, should quietly [[follow]] such a
leader, is a solecism that only a [[desire]] of [[present]] enjoyment and
narrowness of understanding can solve.  educated in slavish
dependence, and enervated by luxury and sloth, where shall we find
men who will stand forth to assert the rights [[right]] of [[man]]; or claim the
privilege of [[moral]] beings, who should have but one road to
excellence? [[slavery]] to monarchs and ministers, which the [[world]] will
be long in freeing itself from, and whose deadly grasp stops the
progress of the [[human]] [[mind]], is not yet abolished.

let not [[men]] then in the [[pride]] of [[power]], use the same arguments that
tyrannic kings [[king]] and venal ministers have used, and fallaciously
assert, that woman ought to be subjected because she has always
been so.  but, when [[man]], governed by reasonable laws [[law]], enjoys his
natural [[freedom]], let him despise woman, if she do not share it with
him; and, till that glorious period arrives, in descanting on the
folly of the [[sex]], let him not overlook his own.

women, it is true, obtaining [[power]] by [[unjust]] means, by practising
or fostering [[vice]], evidently lose the rank which [[reason]] would
assign them, and they become either abject slaves [[slave]] or capricious
tyrants.  they lose all simplicity, all [[dignity]] of [[mind]], in
acquiring [[power]], and act as [[men]] are observed to act when they have
been exalted by the same means.

it is [[time]] to effect a [[revolution]] in female manners, [[time]] to
restore to them their lost [[dignity]], and make them, as a part of the
human [[species]], [[labour]] by reforming themselves to reform the [[world]].
it is [[time]] to separate unchangeable morals [[moral]] from local manners.  if
men be demi-gods, why let us serve them!  and if the [[dignity]] of the
female [[soul]] be as disputable as that of animals, if their reason
does not afford sufficient [[light]] to direct their conduct whilst
unerring instinct is denied, they are surely of all creatures the
most miserable and, bent beneath the iron hand of [[destiny]], must
submit to be a [[fair]] defect in creation.  but to justify the ways of
providence respecting them, by pointing out some irrefragable
reason for thus making such a large portion of [[mankind]] accountable
and not accountable, would puzzle the subtlest casuist.

the only solid foundation for morality appears to be the character
of the supreme being; the harmony of which arises from a balance of
attributes; and, to speak with reverence, one attribute seems to
imply the necessity of another.  he must be just, because he is
wise, he must be [[good]], because he is omnipotent.  for, to exalt one
attribute at the expense of another equally [[noble]] and necessary,
bears the stamp of the warped [[reason]] of [[man]], the homage of passion.
man, accustomed to bow down to [[power]] in his savage [[state]], can
seldom divest himself of this barbarous prejudice even when
civilization determines how much superior mental is to bodily
strength; and his [[reason]] is clouded by these crude opinions [[opinion]], even
when he thinks [[think]] of the deity.  his omnipotence is made to swallow
up, or preside over his other attributes, and those mortals are
supposed to limit his [[power]] irreverently, who [[think]] that it must be
regulated by his [[wisdom]].

i disclaim that [[species]] of [[humility]] which, after investigating
nature, stops at the author.  the high and lofty one, who
inhabiteth eternity, doubtless possesses many attributes of which
we can form no conception; but [[reason]] tells me that they cannot
clash with those i adore, and i am compelled to listen to her
voice.

it seems [[natural]] for [[man]] to search for excellence, and either to
trace it in the object that he worships, or blindly to invest it
with [[perfection]] as a garment.  but what [[good]] effect can the latter
mode of [[worship]] have on the [[moral]] conduct of a [[rational]] being?  he
bends to [[power]]; he adores a dark cloud, which may open a bright
prospect to him, or burst in angry, lawless fury on his devoted
head, he knows [[know]] not why.  and, supposing that the deity acts from
the vague impulse of an undirected will, [[man]] must also [[follow]] his
own, or act according to rules [[rule]], deduced from principles [[principle]] which he
disclaims as irreverent.  into this dilemma have both enthusiasts
and cooler thinkers fallen, when they laboured to [[free]] [[men]] from the
wholesome restraints which a just conception of the [[character]] of
god imposes.

it is not impious thus to scan the attributes of the almighty:  in
fact, who can avoid it that exercises his faculties? for to love
god as the fountain of [[wisdom]], goodness, and [[power]], appears to be
the only [[worship]] useful to a being who wishes [[wish]] to acquire either
virtue or [[knowledge]].  a blind unsettled affection may, like human
passions, occupy the [[mind]] and warm the [[heart]], whilst, to do
justice, [[love]] [[mercy]], and walk humbly with our [[god]], is forgotten.  i
shall pursue this [[subject]] still further, when i consider religion
in a [[light]] opposite to that recommended by dr. gregory, who treats
it as a matter of sentiment or taste.

to return from this apparent digression.  it were to be wished,
that [[women]] would cherish an affection for their husbands, founded
on the same [[principle]] that devotion ought to rest upon.  no other
firm base is there under [[heaven]], for let them beware of the
fallacious [[light]] of sentiment; too often used as a softer phrase
for sensuality.  it follows then, i [[think]], that from their infancy
women should either be shut up like eastern princes [[prince]], or educated in
such a manner as to be able to [[think]] and act for themselves.

why do [[men]] halt between two opinions [[opinion]], and expect impossibilities?
why do they expect [[virtue]] from a [[slave]], or from a being whom the
constitution of civil [[society]] has rendered [[weak]], if not vicious?

still i [[know]] that it will require a considerable length of [[time]] to
eradicate the firmly rooted prejudices which sensualists have
planted; it will also require some [[time]] to convince [[women]] that they
act contrary to their real interest on an enlarged scale, when they
cherish or affect weakness under the name of delicacy, and to
convince the [[world]] that the poisoned source of female vices [[vice]] and
follies, if it be necessary, in compliance with custom, to use
synonymous terms in a lax sense, has been the sensual homage paid
to [[beauty]]:  to [[beauty]] of features; for it has been shrewdly
observed by a [[german]] writer, that a pretty woman, as an object of
desire, is generally allowed to be so by [[men]] of all descriptions;
whilst a fine woman, who inspires more sublime emotions by
displaying intellectual [[beauty]], may be overlooked or observed with
indifference, by those [[men]] who find their [[happiness]] in the
gratification of their appetites.  i foresee an obvious retort;
whilst [[man]] remains such an imperfect being as he appears hitherto
to have been, he will, more or less, be the [[slave]] of his appetites;
and those [[women]] obtaining most [[power]] who gratify a predominant one,
the [[sex]] is degraded by a physical, if not by a [[moral]] necessity.

this objection has, i grant, some [[force]]; but while such a sublime
precept exists, as, "be pure as your heavenly [[father]] is pure;" it
would seem that the virtues [[virtue]] of [[man]] are not limited by the being who
alone could limit them; and that he may press forward without
considering whether he steps out of his sphere by indulging such a
noble [[ambition]].  to the wild billows it has been said, "thus far
shalt thou go, and no further; and here shall thy proud waves be
stayed."  vainly then do they beat and foam, restrained by the
power that confines the struggling planets within their orbits,
matter yields to the [[great]] governing spirit.  but an [[immortal]] [[soul]],
not restrained by mechanical laws [[law]], and struggling to [[free]] itself
from the shackles of matter, contributes to, instead of disturbing,
the order of creation, when, co-operating with the [[father]] of
spirits, it tries to govern itself by the invariable [[rule]] that, in
a [[degree]], before which our [[imagination]] faints, the [[universe]] is
regulated.

besides, if [[women]] are educated for dependence, that is, to act
according to the will of another fallible being, and submit, right
or [[wrong]], to [[power]], where are we to stop?  are they to be
considered as viceregents, allowed to reign over a small domain,
and answerable for their conduct to a higher tribunal, liable to
error?

it will not be difficult to prove, that such delegates will act
like [[men]] subjected by [[fear]], and make their [[children]] and servants
endure their [[tyrannical]] oppression.  as they submit without [[reason]],
they will, having no fixed rules [[rule]] to square their conduct by, be
kind or cruel, just as the whim of the moment directs; and we ought
not to wonder if sometimes, galled by their heavy yoke, they take a
malignant [[pleasure]] in resting it on weaker shoulders.

but, supposing a woman, trained up to [[obedience]], be [[married]] to a
sensible [[man]], who directs her [[judgment]], without making her [[feel]] the
servility of her subjection, to act with as much propriety by this
reflected [[light]] as can be expected when [[reason]] is taken at second
hand, yet she cannot ensure the [[life]] of her protector; he may die
and leave her with a large [[family]].

a double [[duty]] devolves on her; to educate them in the [[character]] of
both [[father]] and [[mother]]; to form their principles [[principle]] and secure their
property.  but, alas! she has never [[thought]], much less acted for
herself.  she has only learned to please [[men]], to depend gracefully
on them; yet, encumbered with [[children]], how is she to obtain
another protector; a husband to supply the place of [[reason]]?  a
rational [[man]], for we are not treading on romantic ground, though he
may [[think]] her a pleasing docile creature, will not choose to marry
a [[family]] for [[love]], when the [[world]] contains many more pretty
creatures.  what is then to become of her?  she either falls an
easy prey to some mean [[fortune]] hunter, who defrauds her [[children]] of
their paternal [[inheritance]], and renders her miserable; or becomes
the victim of discontent and blind indulgence.  unable to educate
her sons [[son]], or impress them with [[respect]]; for it is not a play on
words to assert, that [[people]] are never respected, though filling an
important station, who are not respectable; she pines under the
anguish of unavailing impotent regret.  the serpent's tooth enters
into her very [[soul]], and the vices [[vice]] of licentious [[youth]] bring her
with [[sorrow]], if not with [[poverty]] also, to the grave.

this is not an overcharged picture; on the contrary, it is a very
possible case, and something similar must have fallen under every
attentive eye.

i have, however, taken it for granted, that she was well disposed,
though [[experience]] shows, that the blind may as easily be [[led]] into a
ditch as along the beaten road.  but supposing, no very improbable
conjecture, that a being only taught to please must still find her
happiness in pleasing; what an [[example]] of folly, not to say [[vice]],
will she be to her [[innocent]] daughters!  the [[mother]] will be lost in
the coquette, and, instead of making [[friends]] of her daughters [[daughter]], view
them with [[eyes]] askance, for they are rivals--rivals more cruel than
any other, because they invite a comparison, and drive her from the
throne of [[beauty]], who has never [[thought]] of a seat on the bench of
reason.

it does not require a lively pencil, or the discriminating outline
of a caricature, to sketch the domestic miseries and petty vices
which such a mistress of a [[family]] diffuses.  still she only acts as
a woman ought to act, brought up according to rousseau's [[system]].
she can never be reproached for being masculine, or turning out of
her sphere; nay, she may observe another of his grand rules [[rule]], and,
cautiously preserving her [[reputation]] [[free]] from spot, be reckoned a
good [[kind]] of woman.  yet in what [[respect]] can she be termed [[good]]?
she abstains, it is true, without any [[great]] struggle, from
committing gross crimes; but how does she fulfil her duties [[duty]]?
duties!--in [[truth]] she has enough to [[think]] of to adorn her [[body]] and
nurse a [[weak]] [[constitution]].

with [[respect]] to [[religion]], she never presumed to [[judge]] for herself;
but conformed, as a dependent creature should, to the ceremonies [[ceremony]] of
the [[church]] which she was brought up in, piously believing, that
wiser heads than her own have settled that [[business]]:  and not to
doubt is her point of [[perfection]].  she therefore pays [[pay]] her tythe of
mint and cummin, and thanks her [[god]] that she is not as other women
are.  these are the blessed effects of a [[good]] education! these the
virtues of man's [[man]] helpmate.  i must relieve myself by drawing a
different picture.

let fancy now [[present]] a woman with a tolerable understanding, for i
do not [[wish]] to leave the line of mediocrity, whose [[constitution]],
strengthened by exercise, has allowed her [[body]] to acquire its full
vigour; her [[mind]], at the same [[time]], gradually expanding itself to
comprehend the [[moral]] duties [[duty]] of [[life]], and in what [[human]] [[virtue]] and
dignity consist.  formed thus by the relative duties [[duty]] of her
station, she marries from affection, without losing sight of
prudence, and looking beyond matrimonial felicity, she secures her
husband's [[respect]] before it is necessary to exert mean [[arts]] to
please him, and feed a dying flame, which [[nature]] doomed to expire
when the object became familiar, when [[friendship]] and forbearance
take place of a more ardent affection.  this is the [[natural]] death
of [[love]], and domestic [[peace]] is not destroyed by struggles to
prevent its extinction.  i also suppose the husband to be [[virtuous]];
or she is still more in want of independent principles [[principle]].

fate, however, breaks this tie.  she is left a widow, perhaps,
without a sufficient provision:  but she is not desolate!  the pang
of [[nature]] is [[felt]]; but after [[time]] has softened [[sorrow]] into
melancholy resignation, her [[heart]] turns to her [[children]] with
redoubled fondness, and anxious to provide for them, affection
gives a [[sacred]] heroic cast to her maternal duties [[duty]].  she thinks [[think]] that
not only the eye sees her [[virtuous]] efforts, from whom all her
comfort now must flow, and whose approbation is [[life]]; but her
imagination, a little abstracted and exalted by [[grief]], dwells on
the fond [[hope]], that the [[eyes]] which her trembling hand closed, may
still see how she subdues every wayward passion to fulfil the
double [[duty]] of being the [[father]] as well as the [[mother]] of her
children.  raised to heroism by misfortunes, she represses the
first faint dawning of a [[natural]] inclination, before it ripens into
love, and in the bloom of [[life]] forgets her sex--forgets the
pleasure of an awakening passion, which might again have been
inspired and returned.  she no longer thinks [[think]] of pleasing, and
conscious [[dignity]] prevents her from priding herself on account of
the [[praise]] which her conduct demands.  her [[children]] have her [[love]],
and her brightest hopes [[hope]] are beyond the grave, where her imagination
often strays.

i [[think]] i see her surrounded by her [[children]], reaping the [[reward]] of
her [[care]].  the [[intelligent]] eye meets her's, whilst health and
innocence smile on their chubby cheeks, and as they grow up the
cares of [[life]] are lessened by their grateful attention.  she lives
to see the virtues [[virtue]] which she endeavoured to plant on principles [[principle]],
fixed into habits, to see her [[children]] attain a [[strength]] of
character sufficient to enable them to endure adversity without
forgetting their mother's [[example]].

the task of [[life]] thus fulfilled, she calmly waits for the sleep of
death, and rising from the grave may say, behold, thou gavest me a
talent, and here are five [[talents]].

i [[wish]] to sum up what i have said in a few words, for i here throw
down my gauntlet, and deny the existence of [[sexual]] virtues [[virtue]], not
excepting modesty.  for [[man]] and woman, [[truth]], if i [[understand]] the
meaning of the word, must be the same; yet the fanciful female
character, so prettily drawn by poets and novelists, demanding the
sacrifice of [[truth]] and sincerity, [[virtue]] becomes a relative [[idea]],
having no other foundation than utility, and of that utility men
pretend arbitrarily to [[judge]], shaping it to their own convenience.

women, i allow, may have different duties [[duty]] to fulfil; but they are
human duties [[duty]], and the principles [[principle]] that should regulate the discharge
of them, i sturdily maintain, must be the same.

to become respectable, the exercise of their understanding is
necessary, there is no other foundation for independence of
character; i mean explicitly to say, that they must only bow to the
authority of [[reason]], instead of being the modest slaves [[slave]] of [[opinion]].

in the superior ranks of [[life]] how seldom do we meet with a [[man]] of
superior abilities, or even [[common]] acquirements?  the reason
appears to me clear; the [[state]] they are born in was an unnatural
one.  the [[human]] [[character]] has ever been formed by the employments
the [[individual]], or class pursues; and if the faculties are not
sharpened by necessity, they must remain obtuse.  the argument may
fairly be extended to [[women]]; for seldom occupied by serious
business, the pursuit of [[pleasure]] gives that insignificancy to
their [[character]] which renders the [[society]] of the [[great]] so insipid.
the same want of firmness, produced by a similar cause, forces [[force]] them
both to fly from themselves to noisy pleasures [[pleasure]], and artificial
passions, till vanity takes place of every social affection, and
the characteristics of [[humanity]] can scarcely be discerned.  such
are the blessings of civil governments [[government]], as they are at present
organized, that [[wealth]] and female softness equally tend to debase
mankind, and are produced by the same cause; but allowing [[women]] to
be [[rational]] creatures they should be incited to acquire virtues
which they may call their own, for how can a [[rational]] being be
ennobled by any thing that is not obtained by its own exertions?


chapter 4.

observations on the [[state]] of degradation to which woman is reduced
by various causes.

that woman is naturally [[weak]], or degraded by a concurrence of
circumstances is, i [[think]], clear.  but this position i shall simply
contrast with a conclusion, which i have frequently heard fall from
sensible [[men]] in favour of an [[aristocracy]]:  that the mass of mankind
cannot be any thing, or the obsequious slaves [[slave]], who patiently allow
themselves to be penned up, would [[feel]] their own consequence, and
spurn their chains.  [[men]], they further observe, submit every where
to oppression, when they have only to lift up their heads to throw
off the yoke; yet, instead of asserting their birthright, they
quietly lick the dust, and say, let us [[eat]] and drink, for to-morrow
we [[die]].  [[women]], i argue from analogy, are degraded by the same
propensity to enjoy the [[present]] moment; and, at [[last]], despise the
freedom which they have not sufficient [[virtue]] to struggle to
attain.  but i must be more explicit.

with [[respect]] to the [[culture]] of the [[heart]], it is unanimously allowed
that [[sex]] is out of the [[question]]; but the line of subordination in
the mental powers [[power]] is never to be passed over.  only "absolute in
loveliness," the portion of rationality granted to woman is,
indeed, very scanty; for, denying her genius and [[judgment]], it is
scarcely possible to [[divine]] what remains to characterize [[intellect]].

the stamina of immortality, if i may be allowed the phrase, is the
perfectibility of [[human]] [[reason]]; for, was [[man]] created [[perfect]], or
did a flood of [[knowledge]] break in upon him, when he arrived at
maturity, that precluded error, i should [[doubt]] whether his
existence would be continued after the dissolution of the [[body]].
but in the [[present]] [[state]] of things, every difficulty in morals [[moral]],
that escapes from [[human]] discussion, and equally baffles the
investigation of profound thinking, and the lightning glance of
genius, is an argument on which i build my [[belief]] of the
immortality of the [[soul]].  [[reason]] is, consequentially, the simple
power of improvement; or, more properly speaking, of discerning
truth.  every [[individual]] is in this [[respect]] a [[world]] in itself.
more or less may be conspicuous in one being than other; but the
nature of [[reason]] must be the same in all, if it be an emanation of
divinity, the tie that connects the creature with the creator; for,
can that [[soul]] be stamped with the heavenly image, that is not
perfected by the exercise of its own [[reason]]?  yet outwardly
ornamented with elaborate [[care]], and so adorned to delight [[man]],
"that with [[honour]] he may [[love]]," (vide milton) the [[soul]] of woman is
not allowed to have this distinction, and [[man]], ever placed between
her and [[reason]], she is always represented as only created to see
through a gross medium, and to take things on trust.  but,
dismissing these fanciful theories, and considering woman as a
whole, let it be what it will, instead of a part of [[man]], the
inquiry is, whether she has [[reason]] or not.  if she has, which, for
a moment, i will take for granted, she was not created merely to be
the solace of [[man]], and the [[sexual]] should not [[destroy]] the human
character.

into this error [[men]] have, probably, been [[led]] by viewing education
in a false [[light]]; not considering it as the first step to form a
being advancing gradually toward [[perfection]]; (this word is not
strictly just, but i cannot find a [[better]].) but only as a
preparation for [[life]].  on this sensual error, for i must call it
so, has the false [[system]] of female manners been reared, which robs
the whole [[sex]] of its [[dignity]], and classes the brown and [[fair]] with
the smiling flowers that only adorn the [[land]].  this has ever been
the [[language]] of [[men]], and the [[fear]] of departing from a supposed
sexual [[character]], has made even [[women]] of superior sense adopt the
same sentiments.  thus understanding, strictly speaking, has been
denied to woman; and instinct, sublimated into wit and cunning, for
the purposes [[purpose]] of [[life]], has been substituted in its stead.

the [[power]] of generalizing ideas [[idea]], of drawing comprehensive
conclusions from [[individual]] observations, is the only acquirement
for an [[immortal]] being, that really deserves the name of [[knowledge]].
merely to observe, without endeavouring to account for any thing,
may, (in a very incomplete manner) serve as the [[common]] sense of
life; but where is the store laid up that is to clothe the soul
when it leaves the [[body]]?

this [[power]] has not only been denied to [[women]]; but writers have
insisted that it is inconsistent, with a few exceptions, with their
sexual [[character]].  let [[men]] prove this, and i shall grant that woman
only exists for [[man]].  i must, however, previously remark, that the
power of generalizing ideas [[idea]], to any [[great]] extent, is not very
common amongst [[men]] or [[women]].  but this exercise is the true
cultivation of the understanding; and every thing conspires to
render the cultivation of the understanding more difficult in the
female than the male [[world]].

i am naturally [[led]] by this assertion to the main [[subject]] of the
present [[chapter]], and shall now attempt to point out some of the
causes that degrade the [[sex]], and prevent [[women]] from generalizing
their observations.

i shall not go back to the remote annals of antiquity to trace the
history of woman; it is sufficient to allow, that she has always
been either a [[slave]] or a despot, and to remark, that each of these
situations equally retards the [[progress]] of [[reason]].  the grand
source of female folly and [[vice]] has ever appeared to me to arise
from narrowness of [[mind]]; and the very [[constitution]] of civil
governments has put almost insuperable obstacles in the way to
prevent the cultivation of the female understanding:  yet virtue
can be built on no other foundation!  the same obstacles are thrown
in the way of the [[rich]], and the same consequences ensue.

necessity has been proverbially termed the [[mother]] of invention; the
aphorism may be extended to [[virtue]].  it is an acquirement, and an
acquirement to which [[pleasure]] must be sacrificed, and who
sacrifices [[pleasure]] when it is within the grasp, whose [[mind]] has not
been opened and strengthened by adversity, or the pursuit of
knowledge goaded on by necessity?  [[happy]] is it when [[people]] have the
cares of [[life]] to struggle with; for these struggles prevent their
becoming a prey to enervating vices [[vice]], merely from idleness!  but, if
from their birth [[men]] and [[women]] are placed in a torrid zone, with
the meridian sun of [[pleasure]] darting directly upon them, how can
they sufficiently brace their minds [[mind]] to discharge the duties [[duty]] of
life, or even to relish the affections that carry them out of
themselves?

pleasure is the [[business]] of a woman's [[life]], according to the
present modification of [[society]], and while it continues to be so,
little can be expected from such [[weak]] beings.  inheriting, in a
lineal descent from the first [[fair]] defect in [[nature]], the
sovereignty of [[beauty]], they have, to maintain their [[power]], resigned
their [[natural]] rights [[right]], which the exercise of [[reason]], might have
procured them, and chosen rather to be short-lived queens than
labour to attain the sober pleasures [[pleasure]] that arise from equality.
exalted by their inferiority (this sounds like a contradiction)
they constantly demand homage as [[women]], though [[experience]] should
teach them that the [[men]] who [[pride]] themselves upon paying this
arbitrary insolent [[respect]] to the [[sex]], with the most scrupulous
exactness, are most inclined to tyrannize over, and despise the
very weakness they cherish.  often do they repeat mr. hume's
sentiments; when comparing the french and athenian [[character]], he
alludes to [[women]].  "but what is more singular in this whimsical
nation, say i to the athenians, is, that a frolic of yours during
the saturnalia, when the slaves [[slave]] are served by their masters, is
seriously continued by them through the whole year, and through the
whole course of their lives [[life]]; accompanied too with some
circumstances, which still further augment the absurdity and
ridicule.  your [[sport]] only elevates for a few days, those whom
fortune has thrown down, and whom she too, in [[sport]], may really
elevate forever above you.  but this nation gravely exalts those,
whom [[nature]] has subjected to them, and whose inferiority and
infirmities are absolutely incurable.  the [[women]], though without
virtue, are their masters and sovereigns [[sovereign]]."

ah! why do [[women]], i write with affectionate solicitude, condescend
to receive a [[degree]] of attention and [[respect]] from strangers,
different from that reciprocation of civility which the dictates of
humanity, and the politeness of [[civilization]] authorise between man
and [[man]]?  and why do they not discover, when "in the noon of
beauty's [[power]]," that they are treated like queens only to be
deluded by hollow [[respect]], till they are [[led]] to resign, or not
assume, their [[natural]] prerogatives?  confined then in cages, like
the feathered [[race]], they have nothing to do but to plume
themselves, and stalk with mock-majesty from perch to perch.  it is
true, they are provided with food and raiment, for which they
neither toil nor spin; but health, [[liberty]], and [[virtue]] are given in
exchange.  but, where, amongst [[mankind]] has been found sufficient
strength of [[mind]] to enable a being to resign these adventitious
prerogatives; one who rising with the calm [[dignity]] of [[reason]] above
opinion, dared to be proud of the privileges [[privilege]] inherent in [[man]]? and
it is [[vain]] to expect it whilst hereditary [[power]] chokes the
affections, and nips [[reason]] in the bud.

the [[passions]] of [[men]] have thus placed [[women]] on thrones; and, till
mankind become more reasonable, it is to be feared that [[women]] will
avail themselves of the [[power]] which they attain with the least
exertion, and which is the most indisputable.  they will smile,
yes, they will smile, though told that--

"in beauty's [[empire]] is no mean,
and woman either [[slave]] or queen,
is quickly scorn'd when not ador'd."

but the adoration comes first, and the scorn is not anticipated.

lewis the xivth, in particular, spread factitious manners, and
caught in a specious way, the whole nation in his toils; for
establishing an artful chain of despotism, he made it the interest
of the [[people]] at large, individually to [[respect]] his station, and
support his [[power]].  and [[women]], whom he flattered by a puerile
attention to the whole [[sex]], obtained in his reign that prince-like
distinction so fatal to [[reason]] and [[virtue]].

a [[king]] is always a [[king]], and a woman always a woman: (and a wit,
always a wit, might be added; for the [[vain]] fooleries of wits and
beauties to obtain attention, and make conquests, are much upon a
par.)  his [[authority]] and her [[sex]], ever stand between them and
rational converse.  with a lover, i grant she should be so, and her
sensibility will naturally lead her to endeavour to excite emotion,
not to gratify her vanity but her [[heart]].  this i do not allow to be
coquetry, it is the artless impulse of [[nature]], i only exclaim
against the [[sexual]] [[desire]] of [[conquest]], when the [[heart]] is out of the
question.

this [[desire]] is not confined to [[women]]; "i have endeavoured," says
lord chesterfield, "to gain the hearts [[heart]] of twenty [[women]], whose
persons i would not have given a fig for."  the libertine who in a
gust of passion, takes advantage of unsuspecting tenderness, is a
saint when compared with this cold-hearted rascal; for i like to
use significant words.  yet only taught to please, [[women]] are always
on the watch to please, and with true heroic ardour endeavour to
gain hearts [[heart]] merely to resign, or spurn them, when the [[victory]] is
decided, and conspicuous.

i must descend to the minutiae of the [[subject]].

i lament that [[women]] are systematically degraded by receiving the
trivial attentions, which [[men]] [[think]] it manly to [[pay]] to the [[sex]],
when, in [[fact]], they are insultingly supporting their own
superiority.  it is not condescension to bow to an inferior.  so
ludicrous, in [[fact]], do these ceremonies [[ceremony]] appear to me, that i
scarcely am able to govern my muscles, when i see a [[man]] start with
eager, and serious solicitude to lift a handkerchief, or shut a
door, when the [[lady]] could have done it herself, had she only moved
a pace or two.

a wild [[wish]] has just flown from my [[heart]] to my head, and i will not
stifle it though it may excite a horse laugh.  i do earnestly wish
to see the distinction of [[sex]] confounded in [[society]], unless where
love animates the behaviour.  for this distinction is, i am firmly
persuaded, the foundation of the weakness of [[character]] ascribed to
woman; is the cause why the understanding is neglected, whilst
accomplishments are acquired with sedulous [[care]]:  and the same
cause accounts for their preferring the graceful before the heroic
virtues.

mankind, including every description, [[wish]] to be loved and
respected for something; and the [[common]] herd will always take the
nearest road to the completion of their wishes [[wish]].  the [[respect]] paid
to [[wealth]] and [[beauty]] is the most [[certain]] and unequivocal; and of
course, will always attract the vulgar eye of [[common]] minds [[mind]].
abilities and virtues [[virtue]] are absolutely necessary to raise [[men]] from
the middle rank of [[life]] into notice; and the [[natural]] consequence is
notorious, the middle rank contains most [[virtue]] and abilities.  men
have thus, in one station, at least, an opportunity of exerting
themselves with [[dignity]], and of rising by the exertions which
really improve a [[rational]] creature; but the whole female [[sex]] are,
till their [[character]] is formed, in the same condition as the [[rich]]:
for they are born, i now speak of a [[state]] of [[civilization]], with
certain [[sexual]] privileges [[privilege]], and whilst they are gratuitously granted
them, few will ever [[think]] of works [[work]] of supererogation, to obtain the
esteem of a small number of superior [[people]].

when do we hear of [[women]], who starting out of obscurity, boldly
claim [[respect]] on account of their [[great]] abilities or daring
virtues?  where are they to be found?  "to be observed, to be
attended to, to be taken notice of with sympathy, complacency, and
approbation, are all the advantages which they seek."  true! my
male readers will probably exclaim; but let them, before they draw
any conclusion, recollect, that this was not written originally as
descriptive of [[women]], but of the [[rich]].  in dr. smith's theory of
moral sentiments, i have found a general [[character]] of [[people]] of
rank and [[fortune]], that in my [[opinion]], might with the greatest
propriety be applied to the female [[sex]].  i refer the sagacious
reader to the whole comparison; but must be allowed to quote a
passage to enforce an argument that i mean to insist on, as the one
most conclusive against a [[sexual]] [[character]].  for if, excepting
warriors, no [[great]] [[men]] of any denomination, have ever appeared
amongst the nobility, may it not be fairly inferred, that their
local situation swallowed up the [[man]], and produced a character
similar to that of [[women]], who are localized, if i may be allowed
the word, by the rank they are placed in, by courtesy?  [[women]],
commonly called ladies [[lady]], are not to be contradicted in company, are
not allowed to exert any manual [[strength]]; and from them the
negative virtues [[virtue]] only are expected, when any virtues [[virtue]] are expected,
patience, docility, good-humour, and flexibility; virtues
incompatible with any vigorous exertion of [[intellect]].  besides by
living more with each other, and to being seldom absolutely alone,
they are more under the influence of sentiments than [[passions]].
solitude and reflection are necessary to give to wishes [[wish]] the force
of [[passions]], and enable the [[imagination]] to enlarge the object and
make it the most desirable.  the same may be said of the [[rich]]; they
do not sufficiently deal in general ideas [[idea]], collected by
impassionate thinking, or calm investigation, to acquire that
strength of [[character]], on which [[great]] resolves are built.  but hear
what an acute observer says of the [[great]].

"do the [[great]] seem insensible of the easy price at which they may
acquire the [[public]] admiration? or do they seem to imagine, that to
them, as to other [[men]], it must be the purchase either of sweat or
of [[blood]]?  by what important accomplishments is the [[young]] nobleman
instructed to support the [[dignity]] of his rank, and to render
himself worthy of that superiority over his fellow [[citizens]], to
which the [[virtue]] of his [[ancestors]] had raised them? is it by
knowledge, by industry, by patience, by self-denial, or by virtue
of any [[kind]]?  as all his words, as all his motions are attended to,
he learns an habitual regard for every circumstance of ordinary
behaviour, and studies to perform all those small duties [[duty]] with the
most exact propriety.  as he is conscious how much he is observed,
and how much [[mankind]] are disposed to favour all his inclinations,
he acts, upon the most indifferent occasions [[occasion]], with that [[freedom]] and
elevation which the [[thought]] of this naturally inspires.  his air,
his manner, his deportment all mark that elegant and graceful sense
of his own superiority, which those who are born to an inferior
station can hardly ever arrive at.  these are the [[arts]] by which he
proposes to make [[mankind]] more easily submit to his [[authority]], and
to govern their inclinations according to his own [[pleasure]]:  and in
this he is seldom disappointed.  these [[arts]], supported by rank and
pre-eminence, are, upon ordinary occasions [[occasion]], sufficient to govern
the [[world]].  lewis xiv. during the greater part of his reign, was
regarded, not only in [[france]], but over all [[europe]], as the most
perfect model of a [[great]] [[prince]].  but what were the [[talents]] and
virtues, by which he acquired this [[great]] [[reputation]]? was it by the
scrupulous and inflexible [[justice]] of all his undertakings, by the
immense dangers and difficulties with which they were attended, or
by the unwearied and unrelenting application with which he pursued
them?  was it by his extensive [[knowledge]], by his exquisite
judgment, or by his heroic valour?  it was by none of these
qualities.  but he was, first of all, the most powerful [[prince]] in
europe, and consequently held the highest rank among kings [[king]]; and
then, says his historian, 'he surpassed all his courtiers in the
gracefulness of his shape, and the majestic [[beauty]] of his features.
the sound of his voice [[noble]] and affecting, gained those hearts
which his presence intimidated.  he had a step and a deportment,
which could suit only him and his rank, and which would have been
ridiculous in any other [[person]].  the embarrassment which he
occasioned to those who spoke to him, flattered that secret
satisfaction with which he [[felt]] his own superiority.' these
frivolous accomplishments, supported by his rank, and, no [[doubt]],
too, by a [[degree]] of other [[talents]] and virtues [[virtue]], which seems,
however, not to have been much above mediocrity, established this
prince in the esteem of his own [[age]], and have drawn even from
posterity, a [[good]] deal of [[respect]] for his memory.  compared with
these, in his own times [[time]], and in his own presence, no other [[virtue]],
it seems, appeared to have any [[merit]].  [[knowledge]], industry, valour,
and beneficence, trembling, were abashed, and lost all dignity
before them."

woman, also, thus "in herself complete," by possessing all these
frivolous accomplishments, so changes [[change]] the [[nature]] of things,

--"that what she wills to do or say
seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, [[best]];
all higher [[knowledge]] in her presence falls
degraded.  [[wisdom]] in discourse with her
loses discountenanc'd, and like folly shows;
authority and [[reason]] on her wait."--

and all this is built on her loveliness!

in the middle rank of [[life]], to continue the comparison, [[men]], in
their [[youth]], are prepared for professions, and [[marriage]] is not
considered as the grand feature in their lives [[life]]; whilst [[women]], on
the contrary, have no other scheme to sharpen their faculties.  it
is not [[business]], extensive plans, or any of the excursive flights
of [[ambition]], that engross their attention; no, their thoughts [[thought]] are
not employed in rearing such [[noble]] structures.  to rise in the
world, and have the [[liberty]] of running from [[pleasure]] to [[pleasure]],
they must [[marry]] advantageously, and to this object their [[time]] is
sacrificed, and their persons [[person]] often legally prostituted.  a [[man]],
when he enters any profession, has his eye steadily fixed on some
future advantage (and the [[mind]] gains [[great]] [[strength]] by having all
its efforts directed to one point) and, full of his [[business]],
pleasure is considered as mere relaxation; whilst [[women]] seek for
pleasure as the main [[purpose]] of existence.  in [[fact]], from the
education which they receive from [[society]], the [[love]] of [[pleasure]] may
be said to govern them all; but does this prove that there is a sex
in souls [[soul]]?  it would be just as [[rational]] to declare, that the
courtiers in [[france]], when a destructive [[system]] of despotism had
formed their [[character]], were not [[men]], because [[liberty]], [[virtue]], and
humanity, were sacrificed to [[pleasure]] and vanity.  fatal [[passions]],
which have ever domineered over the whole race!

the same [[love]] of [[pleasure]], fostered by the whole tendency of their
education, gives a trifling turn to the conduct of [[women]] in most
circumstances:  for instance, they are ever anxious about secondary
things; and on the watch for adventures, instead of being occupied
by duties [[duty]].

a [[man]], when he undertakes a [[journey]], has, in general the end in
view; a woman thinks [[think]] more of the incidental occurrences, the
strange things that may possibly occur on the road; the impression
that she may make on her fellow travellers; and, above all, she is
anxiously intent on the [[care]] of the finery that she carries with
her, which is more than ever a part of herself, when going to
figure on a new scene; when, to use an apt french turn of
expression, she is going to [[produce]] a sensation.  can [[dignity]] of
mind [[exist]] with such trivial cares [[care]]?

in short, [[women]], in general, as well as the [[rich]] of both sexes [[sex]],
have acquired all the follies and vices [[vice]] of [[civilization]], and missed
the useful fruit.  it is not necessary for me always to premise,
that i speak of the condition of the whole [[sex]], leaving exceptions
out of the [[question]].  their senses are inflamed, and their
understandings neglected; consequently they become the prey of
their senses, delicately termed sensibility, and are blown about by
every momentary gust of feeling.  they are, therefore, in a much
worse condition than they would be in, were they in a [[state]] nearer
to [[nature]].  ever restless and anxious, their over exercised
sensibility not only renders them uncomfortable themselves, but
troublesome, to use a soft phrase, to others.  all their thoughts
turn on things calculated to excite emotion; and, feeling, when
they should [[reason]], their conduct is unstable, and their opinions
are wavering, not the wavering produced by deliberation or
progressive views, but by contradictory emotions.  by fits and
starts they are warm in many pursuits; yet this warmth, never
concentrated into perseverance, soon exhausts itself; exhaled by
its own heat, or meeting with some other fleeting passion, to which
reason has never given any specific gravity, neutrality ensues.
miserable, indeed, must be that being whose cultivation of [[mind]] has
only tended to inflame its passions!  a distinction should be made
between inflaming and strengthening them.  the [[passions]] thus
pampered, whilst the [[judgment]] is left unformed, what can be
expected to ensue?  undoubtedly, a mixture of madness and folly!

this observation should not be confined to the [[fair]] [[sex]]; however,
at [[present]], i only mean to apply it to them.

novels, [[music]], poetry and gallantry, all tend to make [[women]] the
creatures of sensation, and their [[character]] is thus formed during
the [[time]] they are acquiring accomplishments, the only improvement
they are excited, by their station in [[society]], to acquire.  this
overstretched sensibility naturally relaxes the other powers [[power]] of the
mind, and prevents [[intellect]] from attaining that sovereignty which
it ought to attain, to render a [[rational]] creature useful to others,
and content with its own station; for the exercise of the
understanding, as [[life]] advances, is the only method pointed out by
nature to calm the [[passions]].

satiety has a very different effect, and i have often been forcibly
struck by an emphatical description of damnation, when the spirit
is represented as continually hovering with abortive eagerness
round the defiled [[body]], unable to enjoy any thing without the
organs of sense.  yet, to their senses, are [[women]] made slaves [[slave]],
because it is by their sensibility that they obtain [[present]] [[power]].

and will moralists pretend to assert, that this is the condition in
which one half of the [[human]] [[race]] should be encouraged to remain
with listless inactivity and stupid acquiescence?  kind
instructors! what were we created for?  to remain, it may be said,
innocent; they mean in a [[state]] of [[childhood]].  we might as well
never have been born, unless it were necessary that we should be
created to enable [[man]] to acquire the [[noble]] [[privilege]] of [[reason]], the
power of discerning [[good]] from [[evil]], whilst we [[lie]] down in the dust
from whence we were taken, never to rise again.

it would be an endless task to trace the variety of meannesses,
cares, and sorrows [[sorrow]], into which [[women]] are plunged by the prevailing
opinion, that they were created rather to [[feel]] than [[reason]], and
that all the [[power]] they obtain, must be obtained by their charms
and weakness;

"fine by defect, and amiably weak!"

and, made by this amiable weakness entirely dependent, excepting
what they gain by illicit sway, on [[man]], not only for protection,
but [[advice]], is it surprising that, neglecting the duties [[duty]] that
reason alone points out, and shrinking from trials calculated to
strengthen their minds [[mind]], they only exert themselves to give their
defects a graceful covering, which may serve to heighten their
charms in the eye of the voluptuary, though it sink them below the
scale of [[moral]] excellence?

fragile in every sense of the word, they are obliged to look up to
man for every comfort.  in the most trifling dangers they cling to
their support, with parasitical tenacity, piteously demanding
succour; and their [[natural]] protector extends his arm, or lifts up
his voice, to guard the lovely trembler--from what?  perhaps the
frown of an old cow, or the jump of a mouse; a rat, would be a
serious danger.  in the name of [[reason]], and even [[common]] sense, what
can save such beings from contempt; even though they be soft and
fair?

these fears [[fear]], when not affected, may be very pretty; but they shew a
degree of imbecility, that degrades a [[rational]] creature in a way
women are not aware of--for [[love]] and esteem are very distinct
things.

i am fully persuaded, that we should hear of none of these
infantine airs, if girls were allowed to take sufficient exercise
and not confined in close rooms till their muscles are relaxed and
their powers [[power]] of digestion destroyed.  to carry the remark still
further, if [[fear]] in girls, instead of being cherished, perhaps,
created, were treated in the same manner as cowardice in boys, we
should quickly see [[women]] with more dignified aspects.  it is true,
they could not then with [[equal]] propriety be termed the sweet
flowers that smile in the walk of [[man]]; but they would be more
respectable members of [[society]], and discharge the important duties
of [[life]] by the [[light]] of their own [[reason]].  "educate [[women]] like
men," says [[rousseau]], "and the more they resemble our [[sex]] the less
power will they have over us."  this is the very point i aim at.  i
do not [[wish]] them to have [[power]] over [[men]]; but over themselves.

in the same strain have i heard [[men]] argue against instructing the
poor; for many are the forms that [[aristocracy]] assumes.  "teach them
to [[read]] and write," say they, "and you take them out of the station
assigned them by [[nature]]."  an eloquent frenchman, has answered
them; i will borrow his sentiments.  but they [[know]] not, when they
make [[man]] a brute, that they may expect every instant to see him
transformed into a ferocious beast.  without [[knowledge]] there can be
no morality!

ignorance is a frail base for virtue!  yet, that it is the
condition for which woman was organized, has been insisted upon by
the writers who have most vehemently argued in favour of the
superiority of [[man]]; a superiority not in [[degree]], but essence;
though, to soften the argument, they have laboured to prove, with
chivalrous generosity, that the sexes [[sex]] ought not to be compared; man
was made to [[reason]], woman to [[feel]]:  and that together, flesh and
spirit, they make the most [[perfect]] whole, by blending happily
reason and sensibility into one [[character]].

and what is sensibility?  "quickness of sensation; quickness of
perception; delicacy."  thus is it defined by dr. johnson; and the
definition gives me no other [[idea]] than of the most exquisitely
polished instinct.  i discern not a trace of the image of [[god]] in
either sensation or matter.  refined seventy times [[time]] seven, they are
still material; [[intellect]] dwells not there; nor will [[fire]] ever make
lead gold!

i come round to my old argument; if woman be allowed to have an
immortal [[soul]], she must have as the employment of [[life]], an
understanding to improve.  and when, to render the [[present]] state
more complete, though every thing proves it to be but a fraction of
a mighty sum, she is incited by [[present]] gratification to forget her
grand destination.  [[nature]] is counteracted, or she was born only to
procreate and rot.  or, granting brutes, of every description, a
soul, though not a reasonable one, the exercise of instinct and
sensibility may be the step, which they are to take, in this [[life]],
towards the attainment of [[reason]] in the next; so that through all
eternity they will lag behind [[man]], who, why we cannot tell, had the
power given him of attaining [[reason]] in his first mode of existence.

when i treat of the peculiar duties [[duty]] of [[women]], as i should treat of
the peculiar duties [[duty]] of a citizen or [[father]], it will be found that i
do not mean to insinuate, that they should be taken out of their
families, speaking of the majority.  "he that hath [[wife]] and
children," says [[lord]] bacon, "hath given hostages to [[fortune]]; for
they are impediments to [[great]] enterprises, either of [[virtue]] or
mischief.  certainly the [[best]] works [[work]], and of [[greatest]] [[merit]] for the
public, have proceeded from the unmarried or childless [[men]]." i say
the same of [[women]].  but, the welfare of [[society]] is not built on
extraordinary exertions; and were it more reasonably organized,
there would be still less need of [[great]] abilities, or heroic
virtues.  in the regulation of a [[family]], in the [[education]] of
children, understanding, in an unsophisticated sense, is
particularly required:  [[strength]] both of [[body]] and [[mind]]; yet the men
who, by their writings, have most earnestly laboured to domesticate
women, have endeavoured by arguments dictated by a gross appetite,
that satiety had rendered fastidious, to weaken their bodies [[body]] and
cramp their minds [[mind]].  but, if even by these sinister methods they
really persuaded [[women]], by working on their feelings, to stay at
home, and fulfil the duties [[duty]] of a [[mother]] and mistress of a [[family]], i
should cautiously oppose opinions [[opinion]] that [[led]] [[women]] to [[right]] conduct,
by prevailing on them to make the discharge of a [[duty]] the business
of [[life]], though [[reason]] were insulted.  yet, and i appeal to
experience, if by neglecting the understanding they are as much,
nay, more attached from these domestic duties [[duty]], than they could be
by the most serious intellectual pursuit, though it may be
observed, that the mass of [[mankind]] will never vigorously pursue an
intellectual object, i may be allowed to infer, that [[reason]] is
absolutely necessary to enable a woman to perform any duty
properly, and i must again repeat, that sensibility is not [[reason]].

the comparison with the [[rich]] still occurs to me; for, when men
neglect the duties [[duty]] of [[humanity]], [[women]] will do the same; a common
stream hurries them both along with thoughtless celerity.  riches
and honours [[honour]] prevent a [[man]] from enlarging his understanding, and
enervate all his powers [[power]], by reversing the order of [[nature]], which
has ever made true [[pleasure]] the [[reward]] of [[labour]].
pleasure--enervating [[pleasure]] is, likewise, within woman's reach
without earning it.  but, till hereditary possessions are spread
abroad, how can we expect [[men]] to be proud of [[virtue]]?  and, till
they are, [[women]] will govern them by the most direct means,
neglecting their dull domestic duties [[duty]], to catch the [[pleasure]] that
is on the wing of [[time]].

"the [[power]] of [[women]]," says some author, "is her sensibility;" and
men not aware of the consequence, do all they can to make this
power swallow up every other.  those who constantly employ their
sensibility will have most: for [[example]]; poets, painters, and
composers.  yet, when the sensibility is thus increased at the
expense of [[reason]], and even the [[imagination]], why do philosophical
men [[complain]] of their fickleness?  the [[sexual]] attention of man
particularly acts on female sensibility, and this sympathy has been
exercised from their [[youth]] up.  a husband cannot long [[pay]] those
attentions with the passion necessary to excite lively emotions,
and the [[heart]], accustomed to lively emotions, turns to a new lover,
or pines in secret, the prey of [[virtue]] or prudence.  i mean when
the [[heart]] has really been rendered susceptible, and the taste
formed; for i am apt to conclude, from what i have seen in
fashionable [[life]], that vanity is oftener fostered than sensibility
by the mode of [[education]], and the intercourse between the sexes [[sex]],
which i have reprobated; and that coquetry more frequently proceeds
from vanity than from that inconstancy, which overstrained
sensibility naturally produces [[produce]].

another argument that has had a [[great]] weight with me, must, i
think, have some [[force]] with every considerate benevolent [[heart]].
girls, who have been thus weakly educated, are often cruelly left
by their parents without any provision; and, of course, are
dependent on, not only the [[reason]], but the bounty of their
brothers.  these brothers [[brother]] are, to view the fairest side of the
question, [[good]] sort of [[men]], and give as a favour, what [[children]] of
the same parents had an [[equal]] [[right]] to.  in this equivocal
humiliating situation, a docile female may remain some [[time]], with a
tolerable [[degree]] of comfort.  but, when the [[brother]] marries, a
probable circumstance, from being considered as the mistress of the
family, she is viewed with averted looks as an intruder, an
unnecessary burden on the benevolence of the master of the house,
and his new partner.

who can recount the misery, which many unfortunate beings, whose
minds and bodies [[body]] are equally [[weak]], suffer in such
situations--unable to [[work]] and ashamed to beg?  the [[wife]], a
cold-hearted, narrow-minded woman, and this is not an unfair
supposition; for the [[present]] mode of [[education]] does not tend to
enlarge the [[heart]] any more than the understanding, is [[jealous]] of
the little [[kindness]] which her husband shows to his relations; and
her sensibility not rising to [[humanity]], she is displeased at seeing
the [[property]] of her [[children]] lavished on an helpless sister.

these are matters of [[fact]], which have come under my eye again and
again.  the consequence is obvious, the [[wife]] has recourse to
cunning to undermine the habitual affection, which she is afraid
openly to oppose; and neither tears nor caresses are spared till
the spy is worked out of her [[home]], and thrown on the [[world]],
unprepared for its difficulties; or sent, as a [[great]] effort of
generosity, or from some regard to propriety, with a small stipend,
and an uncultivated [[mind]] into joyless solitude.

these two [[women]] may be much upon a par, with [[respect]] to [[reason]] and
humanity; and changing situations, might have acted just the same
selfish part; but had they been differently educated, the case
would also have been very different.  the [[wife]] would not have had
that sensibility, of which [[self]] is the centre, and [[reason]] might
have taught her not to expect, and not even to be flattered by the
affection of her husband, if it [[led]] him to violate prior duties [[duty]].
she would [[wish]] not to [[love]] him, merely because he loved her, but on
account of his virtues [[virtue]]; and the sister might have been able to
struggle for herself, instead of eating the bitter bread of
dependence.

i am, indeed, persuaded that the [[heart]], as well as the
understanding, is opened by cultivation; and by, which may not
appear so clear, strengthening the organs; i am not now talking of
momentary flashes of sensibility, but of affections.  and, perhaps,
in the [[education]] of both sexes [[sex]], the most difficult task is so to
adjust instruction as not to narrow the understanding, whilst the
heart is warmed by the generous juices of spring, just raised by
the electric fermentation of the season; nor to dry up the feelings
by employing the [[mind]] in investigations remote from [[life]].

with [[respect]] to [[women]], when they receive a careful [[education]], they
are either made fine ladies [[lady]], brimful of sensibility, and teeming
with capricious fancies; or mere notable [[women]].  the latter are
often friendly, honest creatures, and have a shrewd [[kind]] of good
sense joined with worldly prudence, that often render them more
useful members of [[society]] than the fine sentimental [[lady]], though
they possess neither greatness of [[mind]] nor taste.  the intellectual
world is shut against them; take them out of their [[family]] or
neighbourhood, and they stand still; the [[mind]] finding no
employment, for literature affords a fund of amusement, which they
have never sought to relish, but frequently to despise.  the
sentiments and taste of more cultivated minds [[mind]] appear ridiculous,
even in those whom [[chance]] and [[family]] connexions have [[led]] them to
love; but in mere acquaintance they [[think]] it all affectation.

a [[man]] of sense can only [[love]] such a woman on account of her [[sex]],
and [[respect]] her, because she is a trusty servant.  he lets her, to
preserve his own [[peace]], scold the servants, and go to [[church]] in
clothes made of the very [[best]] materials.  a [[man]] of her own size of
understanding would, probably, not agree so well with her; for he
might [[wish]] to encroach on her prerogative, and manage some domestic
concerns himself.  yet [[women]], whose minds [[mind]] are not enlarged by
cultivation, or the [[natural]] selfishness of sensibility expanded by
reflection, are very unfit to manage a [[family]]; for by an undue
stretch of [[power]], they are always tyrannizing to support a
superiority that only rests on the arbitrary distinction of
fortune.  the [[evil]] is sometimes more serious, and domestics are
deprived of [[innocent]] indulgences, and made to [[work]] beyond their
strength, in order to enable the notable woman to keep a better
table, and outshine her neighbours in finery and parade.  if she
attend to her [[children]], it is, in general, to dress them in a
costly manner--and, whether, this attention arises from vanity or
fondness, it is equally pernicious.

besides, how many [[women]] of this description pass their days, or, at
least their evenings, discontentedly.  their husbands acknowledge
that they are [[good]] managers, and chaste wives [[wife]]; but leave [[home]] to
seek for more agreeable, may i be allowed to use a significant
french word, piquant [[society]]; and the patient drudge, who fulfils
her task, like a blind horse in a mill, is defrauded of her just
reward; for the wages due to her are the caresses of her husband;
and [[women]] who have so few resources in themselves, do not very
patiently bear this privation of a [[natural]] [[right]].

a fine [[lady]], on the contrary, has been taught to look down with
contempt on the vulgar employments of [[life]]; though she has only
been incited to acquire accomplishments that rise a [[degree]] above
sense; for even corporeal accomplishments cannot be acquired with
any [[degree]] of precision, unless the understanding has been
strengthened by exercise.  without a foundation of principles [[principle]] taste
is superficial; and grace must arise from something deeper than
imitation.  the [[imagination]], however, is heated, and the feelings
rendered fastidious, if not sophisticated; or, a counterpoise of
judgment is not acquired, when the [[heart]] still remains artless,
though it becomes too tender.

these [[women]] are often amiable; and their hearts [[heart]] are really more
sensible to general benevolence, more alive to the sentiments that
civilize [[life]], than the square elbowed [[family]] drudge; but, wanting
a due proportion of reflection and self-government, they only
inspire [[love]]; and are the mistresses of their husbands, whilst they
have any hold on their affections; and the platonic [[friends]] of his
male acquaintance.  these are the [[fair]] defects in [[nature]]; the women
who appear to be created not to enjoy the fellowship of [[man]], but to
save him from sinking into absolute brutality, by rubbing off the
rough angles of his [[character]]; and by playful dalliance to give
some [[dignity]] to the appetite that draws him to them.  gracious
creator of the whole [[human]] race! hast thou created such a being as
woman, who can trace thy [[wisdom]] in thy works [[work]], and [[feel]] that thou
alone art [[arts]] by thy [[nature]], exalted above her--for no [[better]] [[purpose]]?
can she [[believe]] that she was only made to submit to [[man]] her [[equal]];
a being, who, like her, was sent into the [[world]] to acquire [[virtue]]?
can she [[consent]] to be occupied merely to please him; merely to
adorn the [[earth]], when her [[soul]] is capable of rising to thee?  and
can she rest supinely dependent on [[man]] for [[reason]], when she ought
to mount with him the arduous steeps of [[knowledge]]?

yet, if [[love]] be the supreme [[good]], let [[women]] be only educated to
inspire it, and let every charm be polished to intoxicate the
senses; but, if they are [[moral]] beings, let them have a [[chance]] to
become [[intelligent]]; and let [[love]] to [[man]] be only a part of that
glowing flame of universal [[love]], which, after encircling [[humanity]],
mounts in grateful incense to [[god]].

to fulfil domestic duties [[duty]] much resolution is necessary, and a
serious [[kind]] of perseverance that requires a more firm support than
emotions, however lively and true to [[nature]].  to give an [[example]] of
order, the [[soul]] of [[virtue]], some austerity of behaviour must be
adopted, scarcely to be expected from a being who, from its
infancy, has been made the weathercock of its own sensations.
whoever rationally means to be useful, must have a plan of conduct;
and, in the discharge of the simplest [[duty]], we are often obliged to
act contrary to the [[present]] impulse of tenderness or compassion.
severity is frequently the most [[certain]], as well as the most
sublime proof of affection; and the want of this [[power]] over the
feelings, and of that lofty, dignified affection, which makes a
person prefer the future [[good]] of the beloved object to a present
gratification, is the [[reason]] why so many fond mothers [[mother]] spoil their
children, and has made it questionable, whether negligence or
indulgence is most hurtful:  but i am inclined to [[think]], that the
latter has done most harm.

mankind seem to agree, that [[children]] should be left under the
management of [[women]] during their [[childhood]].  now, from all the
observation that i have been able to make, [[women]] of sensibility are
the most unfit for this task, because they will infallibly, carried
away by their feelings, spoil a child's temper.  the management of
the temper, the first and most important branch of [[education]],
requires the sober steady eye of [[reason]]; a plan of conduct equally
distant from [[tyranny]] and indulgence; yet these are the extremes
that [[people]] of sensibility alternately fall into; always shooting
beyond the mark.  i have followed this train of reasoning much
further, till i have concluded, that a [[person]] of genius is the most
improper [[person]] to be employed in [[education]], [[public]] or private.
minds of this rare [[species]] see things too much in masses, and
seldom, if ever, have a [[good]] temper.  that habitual cheerfulness,
termed [[good]] [[humour]], is, perhaps, as seldom [[united]] with [[great]] mental
powers, as with [[strong]] feelings.  and those [[people]] who [[follow]], with
interest and admiration, the flights of genius; or, with cooler
approbation suck in the instruction, which has been elaborately
prepared for them by the profound thinker, ought not to be
disgusted, if they find the former choleric, and the latter morose;
because liveliness of fancy, and a tenacious comprehension of [[mind]],
are scarcely compatible with that pliant urbanity which leads a
man, at least to bend to the opinions [[opinion]] and prejudices of others,
instead of roughly confronting them.

but, treating of [[education]] or manners, minds [[mind]] of a superior class
are not to be considered, they may be left to [[chance]]; it is the
multitude, with moderate abilities, who call for instruction, and
catch the colour of the atmosphere they breathe.  this respectable
concourse, i contend, [[men]] and [[women]], should not have their
sensations heightened in the hot-bed of luxurious indolence, at the
expence of their understanding; for, unless there be a ballast of
understanding, they will never become either [[virtuous]] or [[free]]:  an
aristocracy, founded on [[property]], or sterling [[talents]], will ever
sweep before it, the alternately timid and ferocious slaves [[slave]] of
feeling.

numberless are the arguments, to take another view of the [[subject]],
brought forward with a show of [[reason]]; because supposed to be
deduced from [[nature]], that [[men]] have used morally and physically to
degrade the [[sex]].  i must notice a few.

the female understanding has often been spoken of with contempt, as
arriving sooner at maturity than the male.  i shall not [[answer]] this
argument by alluding to the early proofs of [[reason]], as well as
genius, in cowley, milton, and [[pope]], (many other names might be
added.) but only appeal to [[experience]] to decide whether [[young]] [[men]],
who are early introduced into company (and examples [[example]] now abound) do
not acquire the same precocity.  so notorious is this [[fact]], that
the bare mentioning of it must bring before [[people]], who at all mix
in the [[world]], the [[idea]] of a number of swaggering apes of [[men]] whose
understandings are narrowed by being brought into the [[society]] of
men when they ought to have been spinning a top or twirling a hoop.

it has also been asserted, by some naturalists, that [[men]] do not
attain their full [[growth]] and [[strength]] till thirty; but that women
arrive at maturity by twenty.  i apprehend that they [[reason]] on
false ground, [[led]] astray by the male prejudice, which deems beauty
the [[perfection]] of woman--mere [[beauty]] of features and [[complexion]],
the vulgar acceptation of the [[world]], whilst male [[beauty]] is allowed
to have some connexion with the [[mind]].  [[strength]] of [[body]], and that
character of countenance, which the french term a physionomie,
women do not acquire before thirty, any more than [[men]].  the little
artless tricks of [[children]], it is true, are particularly pleasing
and attractive; yet, when the pretty freshness of [[youth]] is worn
off, these artless graces become [[studied]] airs, and disgust every
person of taste.  in the countenance of girls we only look for
vivacity and bashful modesty; but, the springtide of [[life]] over, we
look for soberer sense in the face, and for traces of passion,
instead of the dimples of animal spirits; expecting to see
individuality of [[character]], the only fastener of the affections.
we then [[wish]] to converse, not to fondle; to give scope to our
imaginations, as well as to the sensations of our hearts [[heart]].

at twenty the [[beauty]] of both sexes [[sex]] is [[equal]]; but the libertinism of
man leads him to make the distinction, and superannuated coquettes
are commonly of the same [[opinion]]; for when they can no longer
inspire [[love]], they [[pay]] for the vigour and vivacity of [[youth]].  the
french who admit more of [[mind]] into their notions of [[beauty]], give
the preference to [[women]] of thirty.  i mean to say, that they allow
women to be in their most [[perfect]] [[state]], when vivacity gives place
to [[reason]], and to that majestic seriousness of [[character]], which
marks maturity; or, the resting point.  in [[youth]], till twenty the
body shoots out; till thirty the solids are attaining a [[degree]] of
density; and the flexible muscles, growing daily more rigid, give
character to the countenance; that is, they trace the operations of
the [[mind]] with the iron pen of [[fate]], and tell us not only what
powers are within, but how they have been employed.

it is proper to observe, that animals who arrive slowly at
maturity, are the longest lived, and of the noblest [[species]].  men
cannot, however, claim any [[natural]] superiority from the grandeur of
longevity; for in this [[respect]] [[nature]] has not distinguished the
male.

polygamy is another physical degradation; and a plausible argument
for a custom, that blasts every domestic [[virtue]], is drawn from the
well-attested [[fact]], that in the countries [[country]] where it is established,
more females are born than males.  this appears to be an indication
of [[nature]], and to [[nature]] apparently reasonable speculations must
yield.  a further conclusion obviously presents [[present]] itself; if polygamy
be necessary, woman must be inferior to [[man]], and made for him.

with [[respect]] to the formation of the foetus in the womb, we are
very ignorant; but it appears to me probable, that an accidental
physical cause may account for this phenomenon, and prove it not to
be a [[law]] of [[nature]].  i have met with some pertinent observations on
the [[subject]] in forster's account of the isles of the south sea,
that will explain my meaning.  after observing that of the two
sexes amongst animals, the most vigorous and hottest constitution
always prevails, and produces [[produce]] its [[kind]]; he adds,--"if this be
applied to the inhabitants of [[africa]], it is evident that the men
there, accustomed to polygamy, are enervated by the use of so many
women, and therefore less vigorous; the [[women]] on the contrary, are
of a hotter [[constitution]], not only on account of their more
irritable nerves, more sensitive organization, and more lively
fancy; but likewise because they are deprived in their matrimony of
that share of physical [[love]] which in a monogamous condition, would
all be theirs; and thus for the above reasons [[reason]], the generality of
children are born females."

"in the greater part of [[europe]] it has been proved by the most
accurate lists of [[mortality]], that the proportion of [[men]] to [[women]] is
nearly [[equal]], or, if any difference takes place, the males born are
more numerous, in the proportion of 105 to 100."

the necessity of polygamy, therefore, does not appear; yet when a
man seduces a woman, it should i [[think]], be termed a left-handed
marriage, and the [[man]] should be legally obliged to maintain the
woman and her [[children]], unless adultery, a [[natural]] divorcement,
abrogated the [[law]].  and this [[law]] should remain in [[force]] as long as
the weakness of [[women]] caused the word seduction to be used as an
excuse for their frailty and want of [[principle]]; nay, while they
depend on [[man]] for a subsistence, instead of earning it by the
exercise of their own hands or heads.  but these [[women]] should not
in the full meaning of the relationship, be termed wives [[wife]], or the
very [[purpose]] of [[marriage]] would be subverted, and all those
endearing charities that flow from personal fidelity, and give a
sanctity to the tie, when neither [[love]] nor [[friendship]] unites the
hearts, would melt into selfishness.  the woman who is faithful to
the [[father]] of her [[children]] demands [[respect]], and should not be
treated like a prostitute; though i readily grant, that if it be
necessary for a [[man]] and woman to [[live]] together in order to bring up
their offspring, [[nature]] never intended that a [[man]] should have more
than one [[wife]].

still, highly as i [[respect]] [[marriage]], as the foundation of almost
every social [[virtue]], i cannot avoid feeling the most lively
compassion for those unfortunate females who are broken off from
society, and by one error torn from all those affections and
relationships that improve the [[heart]] and [[mind]].  it does not
frequently even deserve the name of error; for many [[innocent]] girls
become the dupes of a sincere affectionate [[heart]], and still more
are, as it may emphatically be termed, ruined before they [[know]] the
difference between [[virtue]] and [[vice]]:  and thus prepared by their
education for infamy, they become infamous.  asylums and magdalens
are not the proper remedies for these abuses [[abuse]].  it is [[justice]], not
charity, that is wanting in the world!

a woman who has lost her [[honour]], imagines that she cannot fall
lower, and as for recovering her former station, it is impossible;
no exertion can wash this stain away.  losing thus every spur, and
having no other means of support, prostitution becomes her only
refuge, and the [[character]] is quickly depraved by circumstances over
which the [[poor]] wretch has little [[power]], unless she possesses an
uncommon portion of sense and loftiness of spirit.  necessity never
makes prostitution the [[business]] of men's lives [[life]]; though numberless
are the [[women]] who are thus rendered systematically vicious.  this,
however, arises, in a [[great]] [[degree]], from the [[state]] of idleness in
which [[women]] are educated, who are always taught to look up to man
for a maintenance, and to consider their persons [[person]] as the proper
return for his exertions to support them.  meretricious airs, and
the whole [[science]] of wantonness, has then a more powerful stimulus
than either appetite or vanity; and this remark gives [[force]] to the
prevailing [[opinion]], that with chastity all is lost that is
respectable in woman.  her [[character]] depends on the observance of
one [[virtue]], though the only passion fostered in her heart--is [[love]].
nay the [[honour]] of a woman is not made even to depend on her will.

when richardson makes clarissa tell lovelace that he had robbed her
of her [[honour]], he must have had [[strange]] notions of [[honour]] and
virtue.  for, miserable beyond all names of misery is the condition
of a being, who could be degraded without its own consent!  this
excess of strictness i have heard vindicated as a salutary error.
i shall [[answer]] in the words of leibnitz--"errors are often useful;
but it is commonly to remedy other errors."

most of the evils [[evil]] of [[life]] arise from a [[desire]] of [[present]] enjoyment
that outruns itself.  the [[obedience]] required of [[women]] in the
marriage [[state]], comes under this description; the [[mind]], naturally
weakened by depending on [[authority]], never exerts its own powers [[power]],
and the [[obedient]] [[wife]] is thus rendered a [[weak]] indolent [[mother]].  or,
supposing that this is not always the consequence, a future state
of existence is scarcely taken into the reckoning when only
negative virtues [[virtue]] are cultivated.  for in treating of morals [[moral]],
particularly when [[women]] are alluded to, writers have too often
considered [[virtue]] in a very limited sense, and made the foundation
of it solely worldly utility; nay, a still more fragile base has
been given to this stupendous fabric, and the wayward fluctuating
feelings of [[men]] have been made the standard of [[virtue]].  yes, virtue
as well as [[religion]], has been subjected to the decisions of taste.

it would almost provoke a smile of contempt, if the vain
absurdities of [[man]] did not strike us on all sides, to observe, how
eager [[men]] are to degrade the [[sex]] from whom they pretend to receive
the [[chief]] [[pleasure]] of [[life]]; and i have frequently, with full
conviction, retorted pope's sarcasm on them; or, to speak
explicitly, it has appeared to me applicable to the whole human
race.  a [[love]] of [[pleasure]] or sway seems to divide [[mankind]], and the
husband who lords [[lord]] it in his little harem, thinks [[think]] only of his
pleasure or his convenience.  to such lengths, indeed, does an
intemperate [[love]] of [[pleasure]] carry some prudent [[men]], or worn out
libertines, who [[marry]] to have a safe companion, that they seduce
their own wives [[wife]].  hymen banishes modesty, and chaste [[love]] takes its
flight.

love, considered as an animal appetite, cannot long feed on itself
without expiring.  and this extinction, in its own flame, may be
termed the [[violent]] [[death]] of [[love]].  but the [[wife]] who has thus been
rendered licentious, will probably endeavour to fill the void left
by the loss of her husband's attentions; for she cannot contentedly
become merely an upper servant after having been treated like a
goddess.  she is still handsome, and, instead of transferring her
fondness to her [[children]], she only dreams [[dream]] of enjoying the sunshine
of [[life]].  besides, there are many husbands so devoid of sense and
parental affection, that during the first effervescence of
voluptuous fondness, they refuse to let their wives [[wife]] suckle their
children.  they are only to dress and [[live]] to please them:  and
love, even [[innocent]] [[love]], soon sinks into lasciviousness when the
exercise of a [[duty]] is sacrificed to its indulgence.

personal attachment is a very [[happy]] foundation for [[friendship]]; yet,
when even two [[virtuous]] [[young]] [[people]] [[marry]], it would, perhaps, be
happy if some circumstance checked their passion; if the
recollection of some prior attachment, or disappointed affection,
made it on one side, at least, rather a match founded on esteem.
in that case they would look beyond the [[present]] moment, and try to
render the whole of [[life]] respectable, by forming a plan to regulate
a [[friendship]] which only [[death]] ought to dissolve.

friendship is a serious affection; the most sublime of all
affections, because it is founded on [[principle]], and cemented by
time.  the very reverse may be said of [[love]].  in a [[great]] [[degree]],
love and [[friendship]] cannot subsist in the same bosom; even when
inspired by different objects they weaken or [[destroy]] each other,
and for the same object can only be [[felt]] in succession.  the vain
fears and fond jealousies, the winds which fan the flame of [[love]],
when judiciously or artfully tempered, are both incompatible with
the tender confidence and sincere [[respect]] of [[friendship]].

love, such as the glowing pen of genius has traced, exists not on
earth, or only resides in those exalted, fervid imaginations [[imagination]] that
have sketched such dangerous pictures.  dangerous, because they not
only afford a plausible excuse to the voluptuary, who disguises
sheer sensuality under a sentimental veil; but as they spread
affectation, and take from the [[dignity]] of [[virtue]].  [[virtue]], as the
very word imports, should have an appearance of seriousness, if not
austerity; and to endeavour to trick her out in the garb of
pleasure, because the epithet has been used as another name for
beauty, is to exalt her on a quicksand; a most insidious attempt to
hasten her fall by apparent [[respect]].  [[virtue]], and [[pleasure]] are not,
in [[fact]], so nearly allied in this [[life]] as some eloquent writers
have laboured to prove.  [[pleasure]] prepares the fading wreath, and
mixes the intoxicating cup; but the fruit which [[virtue]] gives, is
the recompence of toil:  and, gradually seen as it ripens, only
affords calm satisfaction; nay, appearing to be the result of the
natural tendency of things, it is scarcely observed.  bread, the
common food of [[life]], seldom [[thought]] of as a blessing, supports the
constitution, and preserves health; still feasts delight the heart
of [[man]], though disease and even [[death]] lurk in the cup or dainty
that elevates the spirits or tickles the palate.  the lively heated
imagination in the same style, draws the picture of [[love]], as it
draws every other picture, with those glowing colours, which the
daring hand will steal from the rainbow that is directed by a [[mind]],
condemned, in a [[world]] like this, to prove its [[noble]] origin, by
panting after unattainable [[perfection]]; ever pursuing what it
acknowledges to be a fleeting [[dream]].  an [[imagination]] of this
vigorous cast can give existence to insubstantial forms, and
stability to the shadowy reveries which the [[mind]] naturally falls
into when realities are found vapid.  it can then depict [[love]] with
celestial charms, and dote on the grand ideal object; it can
imagine a [[degree]] of mutual affection that shall refine the [[soul]],
and not expire when it has served as a "scale to heavenly;" and,
like devotion, make it absorb every meaner affection and [[desire]].
in each other's arms, as in a temple, with its summit lost in the
clouds, the [[world]] is to be shut out, and every [[thought]] and [[wish]],
that do not nurture pure affection and permanent [[virtue]].  permanent
virtue! alas! [[rousseau]], respectable visionary! thy paradise would
soon be violated by the entrance of some unexpected guest.  like
milton's, it would only contain angels, or [[men]] sunk below the
dignity of [[rational]] creatures.  [[happiness]] is not material, it
cannot be seen or felt!  yet the eager pursuit of the [[good]] which
every one shapes to his own fancy, proclaims [[man]] the [[lord]] of this
lower [[world]], and to be an intelligential creature, who is not to
receive, but acquire [[happiness]].  they, therefore, who [[complain]] of
the delusions of passion, do not recollect that they are exclaiming
against a [[strong]] proof of the immortality of the [[soul]].

but, leaving superior minds [[mind]] to [[correct]] themselves, and [[pay]] dearly
for their [[experience]], it is necessary to observe, that it is not
against [[strong]], persevering [[passions]]; but romantic, wavering
feelings, that i [[wish]] to guard the female [[heart]] by exercising the
understanding; for these paradisiacal reveries are oftener the
effect of idleness than of a lively fancy.

women have seldom sufficient serious employment to [[silence]] their
feelings; a round of little cares [[care]], or [[vain]] pursuits, frittering
away all [[strength]] of [[mind]] and organs, they become naturally only
objects of sense.  in short, the whole tenor of female education
(the [[education]] of society) tends to render the [[best]] disposed,
romantic and inconstant; and the remainder [[vain]] and mean.  in the
present [[state]] of [[society]], this [[evil]] can scarcely be remedied, i am
afraid, in the slightest [[degree]]; should a more laudable ambition
ever gain ground, they may be brought nearer to [[nature]] and [[reason]],
and become more [[virtuous]] and useful as they grow more respectable.

but i will venture to assert, that their [[reason]] will never acquire
sufficient [[strength]] to enable it to regulate their conduct, whilst
the making an appearance in the [[world]] is the first [[wish]] of the
majority of [[mankind]].  to this [[weak]] [[wish]] the [[natural]] affections and
the most useful virtues [[virtue]] are sacrificed.  girls [[marry]] merely to
better themselves, to borrow a significant vulgar phrase, and have
such [[perfect]] [[power]] over their hearts [[heart]] as not to permit themselves to
fall in [[love]] till a [[man]] with a superior [[fortune]] offers.  on this
subject i mean to enlarge in a future [[chapter]]; it is only necessary
to drop a hint at [[present]], because [[women]] are so often degraded by
suffering the selfish prudence of [[age]] to chill the ardour of [[youth]].

>from the same source flows an [[opinion]] that [[young]] girls ought to
dedicate [[great]] part of their [[time]] to needle [[work]]; yet, this
employment contracts their faculties more than any other that could
have been chosen for them, by confining their thoughts [[thought]] to their
persons.  [[men]] order their clothes to be made, and have done with
the [[subject]]; [[women]] make their own clothes, necessary or ornamental,
and are continually talking about them; and their thoughts [[thought]] follow
their hands.  it is not indeed the making of necessaries that
weakens the [[mind]]; but the frippery of dress.  for when a woman in
the lower rank of [[life]] makes her husband's and children's clothes,
she does her [[duty]], this is part of her [[business]]; but when women
work only to dress [[better]] than they could otherwise afford, it is
worse than sheer loss of [[time]].  to render the [[poor]] [[virtuous]], they
must be employed, and [[women]] in the middle rank of [[life]] did they not
ape the fashions of the nobility, without catching their ease,
might employ them, whilst they themselves managed their families [[family]],
instructed their [[children]], and exercised their own minds [[mind]].
gardening, experimental [[philosophy]], and literature, would afford
them subjects [[subject]] to [[think]] of, and matter for conversation, that in
some [[degree]] would exercise their understandings.  the conversation
of french [[women]], who are not so rigidly nailed to their chairs, to
twist lappets, and knot ribbands, is frequently superficial; but, i
contend, that it is not half so insipid as that of those english
women, whose [[time]] is spent in making caps, bonnets, and the whole
mischief of trimmings, not to mention shopping, bargain-hunting,
etc. etc.:  and it is the decent, prudent [[women]], who are most
degraded by these practices; for their motive is simply vanity.
the wanton, who exercises her taste to render her [[person]] alluring,
has something more in view.

these observations all branch out of a general one, which i have
before made, and which cannot be too often insisted upon, for,
speaking of [[men]], [[women]], or professions, it will be found, that the
employment of the thoughts [[thought]] shapes the [[character]] both generally and
individually.  the thoughts [[thought]] of [[women]] ever hover around their
persons, and is it surprising that their persons [[person]] are reckoned most
valuable?  yet some [[degree]] of [[liberty]] of [[mind]] is necessary even to
form the [[person]]; and this may be one [[reason]] why some gentle wives
have so few attractions beside that of [[sex]].  add to this, sedentary
employments render the majority of [[women]] sickly, and false notions
of female excellence make them proud of this delicacy, though it be
another fetter, that by calling the attention continually to the
body, cramps the activity of the [[mind]].

women of quality seldom do any of the manual part of their dress,
consequently only their taste is exercised, and they acquire, by
thinking less of the finery, when the [[business]] of their toilet is
over, that ease, which seldom appears in the deportment of [[women]],
who dress merely for the sake of dressing.  in [[fact]], the
observation with [[respect]] to the middle rank, the one in which
talents thrive [[best]], extends not to [[women]]; for those of the
superior class, by catching, at least a smattering of literature,
and conversing more with [[men]], on general topics, acquire more
knowledge than the [[women]] who ape their fashions and faults [[fault]] without
sharing their advantages.  with [[respect]] to [[virtue]], to use the word
in a comprehensive sense, i have seen most in low [[life]].  many poor
women maintain their [[children]] by the sweat of their brow, and keep
together families [[family]] that the vices [[vice]] of the fathers [[father]] would have
scattered abroad; but gentlewomen are too indolent to be actively
virtuous, and are softened rather than refined by [[civilization]].
indeed the [[good]] sense which i have met with among the [[poor]] women
who have had few advantages of [[education]], and yet have acted
heroically, strongly confirmed me in the [[opinion]], that trifling
employments have rendered [[women]] a trifler.  [[men]], taking her ('i
take her [[body]],' says ranger.) [[body]], the [[mind]] is left to rust; so
that while physical [[love]] enervates [[man]], as being his favourite
recreation, he will endeavour to enslave woman:  and who can tell
how many generations [[generation]] may be necessary to give vigour to the virtue
and [[talents]] of the freed [[posterity]] of abject slaves [[slave]]?  ('supposing
that [[women]] are voluntary slaves--slavery of any [[kind]] is
unfavourable to [[human]] [[happiness]] and improvement.'--'knox's
essays'.)

in tracing the causes that in my [[opinion]], have degraded woman, i
have confined my observations to such as universally act upon the
morals and manners of the whole [[sex]], and to me it appears clear,
that they all spring from want of understanding.  whether this
arises from a physical or accidental weakness of faculties, time
alone can determine; for i shall not lay any [[great]] stress upon the
example of a few [[women]] (sappho, eloisa, mrs. macaulay, the empress
of russia, madame d'eon, etc.  these, and many more, may be
reckoned exceptions; and, are not all heroes, as well as heroines,
exceptions to general rules [[rule]]?  i [[wish]] to see [[women]] neither heroines
nor brutes; but reasonable creatures.) who, from having received a
masculine [[education]], have acquired [[courage]] and resolution; i only
contend that the [[men]] who have been placed in similar situations
have acquired a similar [[character]], i speak of bodies [[body]] of [[men]], and
that [[men]] of genius and [[talents]] have started out of a class, in
which [[women]] have never yet been placed.


chapter 5.

animadversions on some of the writers who have rendered women
objects of [[pity]], bordering on contempt.

the opinions [[opinion]] speciously supported, in some [[modern]] publications on
the female [[character]], and [[education]], which have given the tone to
most of the observations made, in a more cursory manner, on the
sex, remain now to be examined.

section 5.1.

i shall begin with [[rousseau]], and give a sketch of the [[character]] of
women in his own words, interspersing comments and reflections.  my
comments, it is true, will all spring from a few simple principles [[principle]],
and might have been deduced from what i have already said; but the
artificial structure has been raised with so much ingenuity, that
it seems necessary to attack it in a more circumstantial manner,
and make the application myself.

sophia, says [[rousseau]], should be as [[perfect]] a woman as emilius is a
man, and to render her so, it is necessary to examine the character
which [[nature]] has given to the [[sex]].

he then proceeds to prove, that [[women]] ought to be [[weak]] and passive,
because she has less bodily [[strength]] than [[man]]; and from hence
infers, that she was formed to please and to be [[subject]] to him; and
that it is her [[duty]] to render herself agreeable to her master--this
being the grand end of her existence.

supposing [[women]] to have been formed only to please, and be subject
to [[man]], the conclusion is just, she ought to [[sacrifice]] every other
consideration to render herself agreeable to him:  and let this
brutal [[desire]] of self-preservation be the grand spring of all her
actions, when it is proved to be the iron bed of [[fate]], to fit
which, her [[character]] should be stretched or contracted, regardless
of all [[moral]] or physical distinctions.  but if, as i [[think]] may be
demonstrated, the purposes [[purpose]] of even this [[life]], viewing the whole,
are subverted by practical rules [[rule]] built upon this ignoble base, i
may be allowed to [[doubt]] whether woman was created for [[man]]:  and
though the cry of irreligion, or even atheism be raised against me,
i will simply declare, that were an angel from [[heaven]] to tell me
that moses's beautiful, poetical cosmogony, and the account of the
fall of [[man]], were literally true, i could not [[believe]] what my
reason told me was derogatory to the [[character]] of the supreme
being:  and, having no [[fear]] of the [[devil]] before mine [[eyes]], i
venture to call this a suggestion of [[reason]], instead of resting my
weakness on the broad shoulders of the first seducer of my frail
sex.

"it being once demonstrated," continues [[rousseau]], "that [[man]] and
woman are not, nor ought to be, constituted alike in temperament
and [[character]], it follows of course, that they should not be
educated in the same manner.  in pursuing the directions of [[nature]],
they ought indeed to act in concert, but they should not be engaged
in the same employments:  the end of their pursuits should be the
same, but the means they should take to accomplish them, and, of
consequence, their tastes and inclinations should be different."
(rousseau's 'emilius', volume 3 page 176.)

"girls are from their earliest infancy fond of dress.  not content
with being pretty, they are desirous of being [[thought]] so; we see,
by all their little airs, that this [[thought]] engages their
attention; and they are hardly capable of understanding what is
said to them, before they are to be governed by talking to them of
what [[people]] will [[think]] of their behaviour.  the same motive,
however, indiscreetly made use of with boys, has not the same
effect:  provided they are let to pursue their amusements at
pleasure, they [[care]] very little what [[people]] [[think]] of them.  time
and pains [[pain]] are necessary to [[subject]] boys to this motive.

"whencesoever girls derive this first lesson it is a very [[good]] one.
as the [[body]] is born, in a manner before the [[soul]], our first concern
should be to cultivate the former; this order is [[common]] to both
sexes, but the object of that cultivation is different.  in the one
sex it is the developement of corporeal powers [[power]]; in the other, that
of personal charms:  not that either the quality of [[strength]] or
beauty ought to be confined exclusively to one [[sex]]; but only that
the order of the cultivation of both is in that [[respect]] reversed.
women certainly require as much [[strength]] as to enable them to move
and act gracefully, and [[men]] as much address as to qualify them to
act with ease."

*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *

"children of both sexes [[sex]] have a [[great]] many amusements in [[common]]; and
so they ought; have they not also many such when they are grown up?
each [[sex]] has also its peculiar taste to distinguish in this
particular.  boys [[love]] sports [[sport]] of noise and activity; to beat the
drum, to whip the top, and to drag about their little carts:
girls, on the other hand, are fonder of things of show and
ornament; such as mirrors, trinkets, and dolls; the doll is the
peculiar amusement of the females; from whence we see their taste
plainly adapted to their destination.  the physical part of the art
of pleasing lies [[lie]] in dress; and this is all which [[children]] are
capacitated to cultivate of that art [[arts]]."

*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *

"here then we see a primary propensity firmly established, which
you need only to pursue and regulate.  the little creature will
doubtless be very desirous to [[know]] how to dress up her doll, to
make its sleeve knots, its flounces, its head dress, etc., she is
obliged to have so much recourse to the [[people]] about her, for their
assistance in these articles, that it would be much more agreeable
to her to owe them all to her own industry.  hence we have a good
reason for the first lessons which are usually taught these young
females:  in which we do not appear to be setting them a task, but
obliging them, by instructing them in what is immediately useful to
themselves.  and, in [[fact]], almost all of them learn with reluctance
to [[read]] and write; but very readily apply themselves to the use of
their needles.  they imagine themselves already grown up, and think
with [[pleasure]] that such qualifications will enable them to decorate
themselves."

this is certainly only an [[education]] of the [[body]]; but [[rousseau]] is
not the only [[man]] who has indirectly said that merely the [[person]] of
a [[young]] woman, without any [[mind]], unless animal spirits come under
that description, is very pleasing.  to render it [[weak]], and what
some may call beautiful, the understanding is neglected, and girls
forced to sit still, play with dolls, and listen to foolish
conversations; the effect of habit is insisted upon as an undoubted
indication of [[nature]].  i [[know]] it was rousseau's [[opinion]] that the
first years of [[youth]] should be employed to form the [[body]], though in
educating emilius he deviates from this plan; yet the difference
between strengthening the [[body]], on which [[strength]] of [[mind]] in a
great measure depends, and only giving it an easy motion, is very
wide.

rousseau's observations, it is proper to remark, were made in a
country where the art [[arts]] of pleasing was refined only to extract the
grossness of [[vice]].  he did not go back to [[nature]], or his ruling
appetite disturbed the operations of [[reason]], else he would not have
drawn these crude inferences.

in [[france]], boys and girls, particularly the latter, are only
educated to please, to manage their persons [[person]], and regulate their
exterior behaviour; and their minds [[mind]] are corrupted at a very early
age, by the worldly and pious cautions they receive, to guard them
against immodesty.  i speak of [[past]] times [[time]].  the very confessions
which mere [[children]] are obliged to make, and the questions [[question]] [[asked]] by
the holy [[men]] i assert these facts [[fact]] on [[good]] [[authority]], were
sufficient to impress a [[sexual]] [[character]]; and the [[education]] of
society was a school of coquetry and art [[arts]].  at the [[age]] of ten or
eleven; nay, often much sooner, girls began to coquet, and talked,
unreproved, of establishing themselves in the [[world]] by [[marriage]].

in short, they were made [[women]], almost from their very birth, and
compliments were listened to instead of instruction.  these,
weakening the [[mind]], [[nature]] was supposed to have acted like a
step-mother, when she formed this after-thought of creation.

not allowing them understanding, however, it was but consistent to
subject them to [[authority]], independent of [[reason]]; and to prepare
them for this subjection, he gives the following [[advice]]:

"girls ought to be active and diligent; nor is that all; they
should also be early subjected to restraint.  this misfortune, if
it really be one, is inseparable from their [[sex]]; nor do they ever
throw it off but to suffer more cruel evils [[evil]].  they must be [[subject]],
all their lives [[life]], to the most constant and severe restraint, which
is that of decorum:  it is, therefore, necessary to accustom them
early to such confinement, that it may not afterward cost them too
dear; and to the suppression of their caprices, that they may the
more readily submit to the will of others.  if, indeed, they are
fond of being always at [[work]], they should be sometimes compelled to
lay it aside.  dissipation, levity, and inconstancy, are faults
that readily spring up from their first propensities, when
corrupted or perverted by too much indulgence.  to prevent this
abuse, we should learn them, above all things, to lay a due
restraint on themselves.  the [[life]] of a modest woman is reduced, by
our absurd [[institutions]], to a perpetual conflict with herself:  not
but it is just that this [[sex]] should partake of the sufferings which
arise from those evils [[evil]] it hath caused us."

and why is the [[life]] of a modest woman a perpetual conflict?  i
should [[answer]], that this very [[system]] of [[education]] makes it so.
modesty, temperance, and self-denial, are the sober offspring of
reason; but when sensibility is nurtured at the expense of the
understanding, such [[weak]] beings must be restrained by arbitrary
means, and be subjected to continual conflicts; but give their
activity of [[mind]] a wider range, and nobler [[passions]] and motives
will govern their appetites and sentiments.

"the [[common]] attachment and regard of a [[mother]], nay, mere habit,
will make her beloved by her [[children]], if she does nothing to incur
their hate.  even the restraint she lays them under, if well
directed, will increase their affection, instead of lessening it;
because a [[state]] of dependence being [[natural]] to the [[sex]], they
perceive themselves formed for [[obedience]]."

this is begging the [[question]]; for servitude not only debases the
individual, but its effects seem to be transmitted to [[posterity]].
considering the length of [[time]] that [[women]] have been dependent, is
it surprising that some of them hug their chains, and fawn like the
spaniel? "these dogs," observes a naturalist, "at first kept their
ears erect; but custom has superseded [[nature]], and a token of fear
is become a [[beauty]]."

"for the same [[reason]]," adds [[rousseau]], "women have or ought to have,
but little [[liberty]]; they are apt to indulge themselves excessively
in what is allowed them.  addicted in every thing to extremes, they
are even more transported at their diversions than boys."

the [[answer]] to this is very simple.  slaves [[slave]] and mobs have always
indulged themselves in the same excesses, when once they broke
loose from [[authority]].  the bent bow recoils with [[violence]], when the
hand is suddenly relaxed that forcibly held it:  and sensibility,
the plaything of outward circumstances, must be subjected to
authority, or moderated by [[reason]].

"there results," he continues, "from this habitual restraint, a
tractableness which the [[women]] have [[occasion]] for during their whole
lives, as they constantly remain either under subjection to the
men, or to the opinions [[opinion]] of [[mankind]]; and are never permitted to set
themselves above those opinions [[opinion]].  the first and most important
qualification in a woman is good-nature or sweetness of temper;
formed to obey a being so imperfect as [[man]], often full of vices [[vice]],
and always full of faults [[fault]], she ought to learn betimes even to
suffer [[injustice]], and to bear the insults of a husband without
complaint; it is not for his sake, but her own, that she should be
of a mild disposition.  the perverseness and ill-nature of the
women only serve to aggravate their own misfortunes, and the
misconduct of their husbands; they might plainly perceive that such
are not the arms by which they gain the superiority."

formed to [[live]] with such an imperfect being as [[man]], they ought to
learn from the exercise of their faculties the necessity of
forbearance; but all the [[sacred]] rights [[right]] of [[humanity]] are violated by
insisting on blind [[obedience]]; or, the most [[sacred]] rights [[right]] belong
only to [[man]].

the being who patiently endures [[injustice]], and silently bears
insults, will soon become [[unjust]], or unable to discern [[right]] from
wrong.  besides, i deny the [[fact]], this is not the true way to form
or meliorate the temper; for, as a [[sex]], [[men]] have [[better]] tempers
than [[women]], because they are occupied by pursuits that interest the
head as well as the [[heart]]; and the steadiness of the head gives a
healthy temperature to the [[heart]].  [[people]] of sensibility have
seldom [[good]] tempers.  the formation of the temper is the cool work
of [[reason]], when, as [[life]] advances, she mixes with [[happy]] art [[arts]],
jarring elements.  i never knew a [[weak]] or ignorant [[person]] who had a
good temper, though that constitutional [[good]] [[humour]], and that
docility, which [[fear]] stamps on the behaviour, often obtains the
name.  i say behaviour, for [[genuine]] meekness never reached the
heart or [[mind]], unless as the effect of reflection; and, that simple
restraint produces [[produce]] a number of peccant humours [[humour]] in domestic [[life]],
many sensible [[men]] will allow, who find some of these gentle
irritable creatures, very troublesome companions.

"each [[sex]]," he further argues, "should preserve its peculiar tone
and manner:  a meek husband may make a [[wife]] impertinent; but
mildness of disposition on the woman's side will always bring a man
back to [[reason]], at least if he be not absolutely a brute, and will
sooner or later triumph over him."  true, the mildness of [[reason]];
but abject [[fear]] always inspires contempt; and tears are only
eloquent when they flow down [[fair]] cheeks.

of what materials can that [[heart]] be composed, which can melt when
insulted, and instead of revolting at [[injustice]], kiss the rod?  is
it unfair to infer, that her [[virtue]] is built on narrow views and
selfishness, who can caress a [[man]], with true feminine softness, the
very moment when he treats her tyrannically?  [[nature]] never dictated
such insincerity; and though prudence of this sort be termed a
virtue, morality becomes vague when any part is supposed to rest on
falsehood.  these are mere expedients, and expedients are only
useful for the moment.

let the husband beware of trusting too implicitly to this servile
obedience; for if his [[wife]] can with winning sweetness caress him
when angry, and when she ought to be angry, unless contempt had
stifled a [[natural]] effervescence, she may do the same after parting
with a lover.  these are all preparations for adultery; or, should
the [[fear]] of the [[world]], or of hell, restrain her [[desire]] of pleasing
other [[men]], when she can no longer please her husband, what
substitute can be found by a being who was only formed by nature
and art [[arts]] to please [[man]]?  what can make her amends for this
privation, or where is she to seek for a fresh employment?  where
find sufficient [[strength]] of [[mind]] to determine to begin the search,
when her habits are fixed, and vanity has long ruled her chaotic
mind?

but this partial moralist recommends cunning systematically and
plausibly.

"daughters should be always submissive; their mothers [[mother]], however,
should not be inexorable.  to make a [[young]] [[person]] tractable, she
ought not to be made unhappy; to make her modest she ought not to
be rendered stupid.  on the contrary, i should not be displeased at
her being permitted to use some art [[arts]], not to elude [[punishment]] in
case of disobedience, but to exempt herself from the necessity of
obeying.  it is not necessary to make her dependence burdensome,
but only to let her [[feel]] it.  subtilty is a talent [[natural]] to the
sex; and as i am persuaded, all our [[natural]] inclinations are right
and [[good]] in themselves, i am of [[opinion]] this should be cultivated
as well as the others:  it is requisite for us only to prevent its
abuse."

"whatever is, is [[right]]," he then proceeds triumphantly to infer.
granted; yet, perhaps, no aphorism ever contained a more
paradoxical assertion.  it is a solemn [[truth]] with [[respect]] to [[god]].
he, reverentially i speak, sees the whole at once, and saw its just
proportions in the womb of [[time]]; but [[man]], who can only inspect
disjointed parts, finds many things [[wrong]]; and it is a part of the
system, and therefore [[right]], that he should endeavour to alter what
appears to him to be so, even while he bows to the [[wisdom]] of his
creator, and respects [[respect]] the darkness he labours [[labour]] to disperse.

the inference that follows is just, supposing the [[principle]] to be
sound: "the superiority of address, peculiar to the female [[sex]], is
a very equitable indemnification for their inferiority in point of
strength: without this, woman would not be the companion of [[man]];
but his [[slave]]:  it is by her superiour art [[arts]] and ingenuity that she
preserves her equality, and governs him while she affects to obey.
woman has every thing against her, as well our faults [[fault]] as her own
timidity and weakness: she has nothing in her favour, but her
subtilty and her [[beauty]].  is it not very reasonable, therefore, she
should cultivate both?"  greatness of [[mind]] can never dwell with
cunning or address; for i shall not boggle about words, when their
direct signification is insincerity and falsehood; but content
myself with observing, that if any class of [[mankind]] be so created
that it must necessarily be educated by rules [[rule]], not strictly
deducible from [[truth]], [[virtue]] is an affair of convention.  how could
rousseau dare to assert, after giving this [[advice]], that in the
grand end of existence, the object of both sexes [[sex]] should be the
same, when he well knew, that the [[mind]] formed by its pursuits, is
expanded by [[great]] views swallowing up little ones, or that it
becomes itself little?

men have superiour [[strength]] of [[body]]; but were it not for mistaken
notions of [[beauty]], [[women]] would acquire sufficient to enable them to
earn their own subsistence, the true definition of independence;
and to bear those bodily inconveniences and exertions that are
requisite to strengthen the [[mind]].

let us then, by being allowed to take the same exercise as boys,
not only during infancy, but [[youth]], arrive at [[perfection]] of [[body]],
that we may [[know]] how far the [[natural]] superiority of [[man]] extends.
for what [[reason]] or [[virtue]] can be expected from a creature when the
seed-time of [[life]] is neglected? none--did not the winds of heaven
casually scatter many useful seeds in the fallow ground.

"beauty cannot be acquired by dress, and coquetry is an art [[arts]] not so
early and speedily attained.  while girls are yet [[young]], however,
they are in a capacity to study agreeable gesture, a pleasing
modulation of voice, an easy carriage and behaviour; as well as to
take the advantage of gracefully adapting their looks and attitudes
to [[time]], place, and [[occasion]].  their application, therefore, should
not be solely confined to the [[arts]] of industry and the needle, when
they come to display other [[talents]], whose utility is already
apparent." "for my part i would have a [[young]] englishwoman cultivate
her agreeable [[talents]], in order to please her future husband, with
as much [[care]] and assiduity as a [[young]] circassian cultivates her's,
to fit her for the haram of an eastern bashaw."

to render [[women]] completely insignificant, he adds,--"the tongues of
women are very voluble; they speak earlier, more readily, and more
agreeably than the [[men]]; they are accused also of speaking much
more:  but so it ought to be, and i should be very ready to convert
this reproach into a compliment; their lips and [[eyes]] have the same
activity, and for the same [[reason]].  a [[man]] speaks of what he knows [[know]],
a woman of what pleases her; the one requires [[knowledge]], the other
taste; the principal object of a man's [[man]] discourse should be what is
useful, that of a woman's what is agreeable.  there ought to be
nothing in [[common]] between their different conversation but [[truth]]."

"we ought not, therefore, to restrain the prattle of girls, in the
same manner as we should that of boys, with that severe [[question]],
'to what [[purpose]] are you talking?' but by another, which is no less
difficult to [[answer]], 'how will your discourse be received?'  in
infancy, while they are as yet incapable to discern [[good]] from [[evil]],
they ought to observe it as a [[law]], never to say any thing
disagreeable to those whom they are speaking to:  what will render
the practice of this [[rule]] also the more difficult, is, that it must
ever be subordinate to the former, of never speaking falsely or
telling an untruth."  to govern the tongue in this manner must
require [[great]] address indeed; and it is too much practised both by
men and [[women]].  out of the abundance of the [[heart]] how few speak!
so few, that i, who [[love]] simplicity, would gladly give up
politeness for a quarter of the [[virtue]] that has been sacrificed to
an equivocal quality, which, at [[best]], should only be the polish of
virtue.

but to complete the sketch.  "it is easy to be conceived, that if
male [[children]] be not in a capacity to form any true notions of
religion, those ideas [[idea]] must be greatly above the conception of the
females:  it is for this very [[reason]], i would begin to speak to
them the earlier on this [[subject]]; for if we were to wait till they
were in a capacity to discuss methodically such profound questions [[question]],
we should run a risk of never speaking to them on this [[subject]] as
long as they lived.  [[reason]] in [[women]] is a practical [[reason]],
capacitating them artfully to discover the means of attaining a
known end, but which would never enable them to discover that end
itself.  the social relations of the sexes [[sex]] are indeed truly
admirable:  from their union there results a [[moral]] [[person]], of which
woman may be termed the [[eyes]], and [[man]] the hand, with this
dependence on each other, that it is from the [[man]] that the woman is
to learn what she is to see, and it is of the woman that [[man]] is to
learn what he ought to do.  if woman could recur to the first
principles of things as well as [[man]], and [[man]] was capacitated to
enter into their minutae as well as woman, always independent of
each other, they would [[live]] in perpetual discord, and their union
could not subsist.  but in the [[present]] harmony which naturally
subsists between them, their different faculties tend to one common
end; it is difficult to say which of them conduces the most to it:
each follows the impulse of the other; each is [[obedient]], and both
are masters."

"as the conduct of a woman is subservient to the [[public]] [[opinion]],
her [[faith]] in matters of [[religion]], should for that very [[reason]], be
subject to [[authority]].  'every [[daughter]] ought to be of the same
religion as her [[mother]], and every [[wife]] to be of the same religion
as her husband:  for, though such [[religion]] should be false, that
docility which induces the [[mother]] and [[daughter]] to submit to the
order of [[nature]], takes away, in the sight of [[god]], the criminality
of their error'.*  as they are not in a capacity to [[judge]] for
themselves, they ought to abide by the decision of their fathers
and husbands as confidently as by that of the [[church]]."

(*footnote.  what is to be the consequence, if the mother's and
husband's [[opinion]] should [[chance]] not to agree?  an ignorant person
cannot be reasoned out of an error, and when persuaded to give up
one prejudice for another the [[mind]] is unsettled.  indeed, the
husband may not have any [[religion]] to [[teach]] her though in such a
situation she will be in [[great]] want of a support to her [[virtue]],
independent of worldly considerations.)

"as [[authority]] ought to regulate the [[religion]] of the [[women]], it is
not so needful to explain to them the reasons [[reason]] for their [[belief]], as
to lay down precisely the tenets they are to [[believe]]:  for the
creed, which presents [[present]] only obscure ideas [[idea]] to the [[mind]], is the source
of fanaticism; and that which presents [[present]] absurdities, leads to
infidelity."

absolute, uncontroverted [[authority]], it seems, must subsist
somewhere:  but is not this a direct and exclusive appropriation of
reason?  the rights [[right]] of [[humanity]] have been thus confined to the male
line from adam downwards.  [[rousseau]] would carry his male
aristocracy still further, for he insinuates, that he should not
blame those, who contend for leaving woman in a [[state]] of the most
profound ignorance, if it were not necessary, in order to preserve
her chastity, and justify the man's [[man]] [[choice]] in the [[eyes]] of the
world, to give her a little [[knowledge]] of [[men]], and the customs
produced by [[human]] [[passions]]; else she might propagate at home
without being rendered less voluptuous and [[innocent]] by the exercise
of her understanding:  excepting, indeed, during the first year of
marriage, when she might employ it to dress, like sophia.  "her
dress is extremely modest in appearance, and yet very coquettish in
fact:  she does not make a display of her charms, she conceals
them; but, in concealing them, she knows [[know]] how to affect your
imagination.  every one who sees her, will say, there is a modest
and discreet girl; but while you are near her, your [[eyes]] and
affections wander all over her [[person]], so that you cannot withdraw
them; and you would conclude that every part of her dress, simple
as it seems, was only put in its proper order to be taken to pieces
by the [[imagination]]."  is this modesty?  is this a preparation for
immortality?  again.  what [[opinion]] are we to form of a [[system]] of
education, when the author says of his heroine, "that with her,
doing things well is but a secondary concern; her principal concern
is to do them neatly."

secondary, in [[fact]], are all her virtues [[virtue]] and qualities, for,
respecting [[religion]], he makes her parents thus address her,
accustomed to submission--"your husband will instruct you in good
time."

after thus cramping a woman's [[mind]], if, in order to keep it [[fair]],
he has not made it quite a blank, he advises her to reflect, that a
reflecting [[man]] may not yawn in her company, when he is tired of
caressing her.  what has she to reflect about, who must obey? and
would it not be a refinement on [[cruelty]] only to open her [[mind]] to
make the darkness and misery of her [[fate]] visible?  yet these are
his sensible remarks; how consistent with what i have already been
obliged to quote, to give a [[fair]] view of the [[subject]], the reader
may determine.

"they who pass their whole lives [[life]] in working for their daily bread,
have no ideas [[idea]] beyond their [[business]] or their interest, and all
their understanding seems to [[lie]] in their fingers' ends.  this
ignorance is neither prejudicial to their integrity nor their
morals; it is often of service to them.  sometimes, by means of
reflection, we are [[led]] to compound with our [[duty]], and we conclude,
by substituting a jargon of words, in the room of things.  our own
conscience is the most enlightened philosopher.  there is no need
of being acquainted with tully's offices, to make a [[man]] of probity:
and perhaps the most [[virtuous]] woman in the [[world]] is the least
acquainted with the definition of [[virtue]].  but it is no less true,
than an improved understanding only can render [[society]] agreeable;
and it is a melancholy thing for a [[father]] of a [[family]], who is fond
of [[home]], to be obliged to be always wrapped up in himself, and to
have nobody about him to whom he can impart his sentiments.

"besides, how should a woman void of reflection be capable of
educating her [[children]]?  how should she discern what is proper for
them?  how should she incline them to those virtues [[virtue]] she is
unacquainted with, or to that [[merit]] of which she has no [[idea]]?  she
can only sooth or chide them; render them insolent or timid; she
will make them formal coxcombs, or ignorant blockheads; but will
never make them sensible or amiable."  how indeed should she, when
her husband is not always at hand to lend her his [[reason]] --when
they both together make but one [[moral]] being?  a blind will, "eyes
without hands," would go a very little way; and perchance his
abstract [[reason]], that should concentrate the scattered beams of her
practical [[reason]], may be employed in judging of the flavour of
wine, discanting on the sauces most proper for turtle; or, more
profoundly intent at a card-table, he may be generalizing his ideas
as he bets away his [[fortune]], leaving all the minutiae of education
to his helpmate or [[chance]].

but, granting that woman ought to be beautiful, [[innocent]], and
silly, to render her a more alluring and indulgent companion--what
is her understanding sacrificed for?  and why is all this
preparation necessary only, according to rousseau's own account, to
make her the mistress of her husband, a very short [[time]]?  for no
man ever insisted more on the transient [[nature]] of [[love]].  thus
speaks the philosopher.  "sensual pleasures [[pleasure]] are transient.  the
habitual [[state]] of the affections always loses by their
gratification.  the [[imagination]], which decks the object of our
desires, is lost in fruition.  excepting the supreme being, who is
self-existent, there is nothing beautiful but what is ideal."

but he returns to his unintelligible paradoxes again, when he thus
addresses sophia.  "emilius, in becoming your husband, is become
your master, and claims your [[obedience]].  such is the order of
nature.  when a [[man]] is [[married]], however, to such a [[wife]] as sophia,
it is proper he should be directed by her:  this is also agreeable
to the order of [[nature]]:  it is, therefore, to give you as much
authority over his [[heart]] as his [[sex]] gives him over your [[person]],
that i have made you the arbiter of his pleasures [[pleasure]].  it may cost
you, perhaps, some disagreeable self-denial; but you will be
certain of maintaining your [[empire]] over him, if you can preserve it
over yourself;  what i have already observed, also shows me, that
this difficult attempt does not surpass your [[courage]].

"would you have your husband constantly at your feet? keep him at
some distance from your [[person]].  you will long maintain the
authority of [[love]], if you [[know]] but how to render your favours rare
and valuable.  it is thus you may employ even the [[arts]] of coquetry
in the service of [[virtue]], and those of [[love]] in that of [[reason]]."

i shall close my extracts with a just description of a comfortable
couple.  "and yet you must not imagine, that even such management
will always suffice.  whatever precaution be taken, enjoyment will,
by degrees [[degree]], take off the edge of passion.  but when [[love]] hath
lasted as long as possible, a pleasing habitude supplies its place,
and the attachment of a mutual confidence succeeds to the
transports of passion.  [[children]] often form a more agreeable and
permanent connexion between [[married]] [[people]] than even [[love]] itself.
when you cease to be the mistress of emilius, you will continue to
be his [[wife]] and friend; you will be the [[mother]] of his [[children]]."
(rousseau's emilius.)

children, he truly observes, form a much more permanent connexion
between [[married]] [[people]] than [[love]].  [[beauty]] he declares will not be
valued, or even seen, after a couple have lived six months
together; artificial graces and coquetry will likewise pall on the
senses:  why then does he say, that a girl should be educated for
her husband with the same [[care]] as for an eastern haram?

i now appeal from the reveries of fancy and refined licentiousness
to the [[good]] sense of [[mankind]], whether, if the object of education
be to prepare [[women]] to become chaste wives [[wife]] and sensible mothers [[mother]],
the method so plausibly recommended in the foregoing sketch, be the
one [[best]] calculated to [[produce]] those ends?  will it be allowed that
the surest way to make a [[wife]] chaste, is to [[teach]] her to practise
the wanton [[arts]] of a mistress, termed [[virtuous]] coquetry by the
sensualist who can no longer relish the artless charms of
sincerity, or taste the [[pleasure]] arising from a tender intimacy,
when confidence is unchecked by suspicion, and rendered interesting
by sense?

the [[man]] who can be contented to [[live]] with a pretty useful companion
without a [[mind]], has lost in voluptuous gratifications a taste for
more refined enjoyments; he has never [[felt]] the calm satisfaction
that refreshes the parched [[heart]], like the silent dew of heaven--of
being beloved by one who could [[understand]] him.  in the [[society]] of
his [[wife]] he is still alone, unless when the [[man]] is sunk in the
brute.  "the charm of [[life]]," says a grave philosophical reasoner,
is "sympathy; nothing pleases us more than to observe in other men
a fellow-feeling with all the emotions of our own breast."

but, according to the tenor of reasoning by which [[women]] are kept
from the tree of [[knowledge]], the important years of [[youth]], the
usefulness of [[age]], and the [[rational]] hopes [[hope]] of futurity, are all to
be sacrificed, to render woman an object of [[desire]] for a short
time.  besides, how could [[rousseau]] expect them to be [[virtuous]] and
constant when [[reason]] is neither allowed to be the foundation of
their [[virtue]], nor [[truth]] the object of their inquiries?

but all rousseau's errors in reasoning arose from sensibility, and
sensibility to their charms [[women]] are very ready to forgive!  when
he should have reasoned he became impassioned, and reflection
inflamed his [[imagination]], instead of enlightening his
understanding.  even his virtues [[virtue]] also [[led]] him farther astray; for,
born with a warm [[constitution]] and lively fancy, [[nature]] carried him
toward the other [[sex]] with such eager fondness, that he soon became
lascivious.  had he given way to these desires [[desire]], the [[fire]] would have
extinguished itself in a [[natural]] manner, but [[virtue]], and a romantic
kind of delicacy, made him practise self-denial; yet, when [[fear]],
delicacy, or [[virtue]] restrained him, he debauched his [[imagination]];
and reflecting on the sensations to which fancy gave [[force]], he
traced them in the most glowing colours, and sunk them deep into
his [[soul]].

he then sought for solitude, not to sleep with the [[man]] of [[nature]];
or calmly investigate the causes of things under the shade where
sir isaac newton indulged contemplation, but merely to indulge his
feelings.  and so warmly has he painted what he forcibly [[felt]],
that, interesting the [[heart]] and inflaming the [[imagination]] of his
readers; in proportion to the [[strength]] of their fancy, they imagine
that their understanding is convinced, when they only sympathize
with a poetic writer, who skilfully exhibits the objects of sense,
most voluptuously shadowed, or gracefully veiled; and thus making
us [[feel]], whilst dreaming that we [[reason]], erroneous conclusions are
left in the [[mind]].

why was rousseau's [[life]] divided between ecstasy and misery?  can
any other [[answer]] be given than this, that the effervescence of his
imagination produced both; but, had his fancy been allowed to cool,
it is possible that he might have acquired more [[strength]] of [[mind]].
still, if the [[purpose]] of [[life]] be to educate the intellectual part
of [[man]], all with [[respect]] to him was [[right]]; yet, had not [[death]] led
to a nobler scene of action, it is probable that he would have
enjoyed more [[equal]] [[happiness]] on [[earth]], and have [[felt]] the calm
sensations of the [[man]] of [[nature]], instead of being prepared for
another stage of existence by nourishing the [[passions]] which agitate
the civilized [[man]].

but [[peace]] to his manes!  i [[war]] not with his ashes, but his
opinions.  i [[war]] only with the sensibility that [[led]] him to degrade
woman by making her the [[slave]] of [[love]].

...."curs'd vassalage,
first idoliz'd till love's hot [[fire]] be o'er,
then slaves [[slave]] to those who courted us before."
dryden.

the pernicious tendency of those books [[book]], in which the writers
insidiously degrade the [[sex]], whilst they are prostrate before their
personal charms, cannot be too often or too severely exposed.

let us, my dear contemporaries, arise above such narrow prejudices!
if [[wisdom]] is desirable on its own account, if [[virtue]], to deserve
the name, must be founded on [[knowledge]]; let us endeavour to
strengthen our minds [[mind]] by reflection, till our heads become a balance
for our hearts [[heart]]; let us not confine all our thoughts [[thought]] to the petty
occurrences of the day, nor our [[knowledge]] to an acquaintance with
our lovers' or husbands' hearts [[heart]]; but let the practice of every duty
be subordinate to the grand one of improving our minds [[mind]], and
preparing our affections for a more exalted state!

beware then, my [[friends]], of suffering the [[heart]] to be moved by
every trivial incident:  the reed is shaken by a breeze, and
annually dies, but the oak stands firm, and for ages [[age]] braves the
storm.

were we, indeed, only created to flutter our hour out and die--why
let us then indulge sensibility, and laugh at the severity of
reason.  yet, alas! even then we should want [[strength]] of [[body]] and
mind, and [[life]] would be lost in feverish pleasures [[pleasure]] or wearisome
languor.

but the [[system]] of [[education]], which i earnestly [[wish]] to see
exploded, seems to presuppose, what ought never to be taken for
granted, that [[virtue]] shields us from the casualties of [[life]]; and
that [[fortune]], slipping off her bandage, will smile on a
well-educated female, and bring in her hand an emilius or a
telemachus.  whilst, on the contrary, the [[reward]] which virtue
promises to her votaries is confined, it is clear, to their own
bosoms; and often must they contend with the most vexatious worldly
cares, and bear with the vices [[vice]] and humours [[humour]] of relations for whom
they can never [[feel]] a [[friendship]].

there have been many [[women]] in the [[world]] who, instead of being
supported by the [[reason]] and [[virtue]] of their fathers [[father]] and brothers [[brother]],
have strengthened their own minds [[mind]] by struggling with their vices
and follies; yet have never met with a hero, in the shape of a
husband; who, paying the debt that [[mankind]] owed them, might chance
to bring back their [[reason]] to its [[natural]] dependent [[state]], and
restore the usurped prerogative, of rising above [[opinion]], to [[man]].

section 5.2.

dr. fordyce's sermons have long made a part of a [[young]] woman's
library; nay, girls at school are allowed to [[read]] them; but i
should instantly dismiss them from my pupil's, if i wished to
strengthen her understanding, by leading her to form sound
principles on a broad basis; or, were i only anxious to cultivate
her taste; though they must be allowed to contain many sensible
observations.

dr. fordyce may have had a very laudable end in view; but these
discourses are written in such an affected style, that were it only
on that account, and had i nothing to object against his
mellifluous precepts, i should not allow girls to peruse them,
unless i designed to hunt every spark of [[nature]] out of their
composition, melting every [[human]] quality into female weakness and
artificial grace.  i say artificial, for true grace arises from
some [[kind]] of independence of [[mind]].

children, careless of pleasing, and only anxious to amuse
themselves, are often very graceful; and the nobility who have
mostly lived with inferiors, and always had the command of [[money]],
acquire a graceful ease of deportment, which should rather be
termed habitual grace of [[body]], than that superiour gracefulness
which is truly the expression of the [[mind]].  this mental grace, not
noticed by vulgar [[eyes]], often flashes across a rough countenance,
and irradiating every feature, shows simplicity and independence of
mind.  it is then we [[read]] characters [[character]] of immortality in the eye, and
see the [[soul]] in every gesture, though when at rest, neither the
face nor limbs may have much [[beauty]] to recommend them; or the
behaviour, any thing peculiar to attract universal attention.  the
mass of [[mankind]], however, look for more tangible [[beauty]]; yet
simplicity is, in general, admired, when [[people]] do not consider
what they [[admire]]; and can there be simplicity without sincerity?
but, to have done with remarks that are in some measure desultory,
though naturally excited by the [[subject]].

in declamatory periods dr. fordyce spins out rousseau's eloquence;
and in most sentimental rant, details his opinions [[opinion]] respecting the
female [[character]], and the behaviour which woman ought to assume to
render her lovely.

he shall speak for himself, for thus he makes [[nature]] address [[man]].
"behold these smiling innocents, whom i have graced with my fairest
gifts, and committed to your protection; behold them with [[love]] and
respect; treat them with tenderness and [[honour]].  they are timid and
want to be defended.  they are frail; o do not take advantage of
their weakness!  let their fears [[fear]] and blushes endear them.  let
their confidence in you never be abused.  but is it possible, that
any of you can be such barbarians, so supremely wicked, as to abuse
it?  can you find in your hearts* to despoil the gentle, trusting
creatures of their treasure, or do any thing to strip them of their
native robe of [[virtue]]?  curst be the impious hand that would dare
to violate the unblemished form of chastity!  thou wretch! thou
ruffian! forbear; nor venture to provoke heaven's fiercest
vengeance."  i [[know]] not any comment that can be made seriously on
this [[curious]] passage, and i could [[produce]] many similar ones; and
some, so very sentimental, that i have heard [[rational]] [[men]] use the
word indecent, when they mentioned them with disgust.

(*footnote.  can you?--can you? would be the most emphatical
comment, were it drawled out in a whining voice.)

throughout there is a display of cold, artificial feelings, and
that parade of sensibility which boys and girls should be taught to
despise as the sure mark of a little [[vain]] [[mind]].  florid appeals are
made to [[heaven]], and to the beauteous innocents, the fairest images
of [[heaven]] here below, whilst sober sense is left far behind.  this
is not the [[language]] of the [[heart]], nor will it ever reach it, though
the ear may be tickled.

i shall be told, perhaps, that the [[public]] have been pleased with
these volumes.  true--and hervey's meditations are still [[read]],
though he equally sinned against sense and taste.

i particularly object to the lover-like phrases of pumped up
passion, which are every where interspersed.  if [[women]] be ever
allowed to walk without leading-strings, why must they be cajoled
into [[virtue]] by artful [[flattery]] and [[sexual]] compliments?  speak to
them the [[language]] of [[truth]] and soberness, and away with the lullaby
strains of condescending endearment!  let them be taught to respect
themselves as [[rational]] creatures, and not [[led]] to have a passion for
their own insipid persons [[person]].  it moves my gall to hear a preacher
descanting on dress and needle-work; and still more, to hear him
address the 'british [[fair]], the fairest of the fair', as if they had
only feelings.

even recommending piety he uses the following argument.  "never,
perhaps, does a fine woman strike more deeply, than when, composed
into pious recollection, and possessed with the noblest
considerations, she assumes, without knowing it, superiour dignity
and new graces; so that the beauties [[beauty]] of holiness seem to radiate
about her, and the by-standers are almost induced to fancy her
already worshipping amongst her kindred angels!"  why are [[women]] to
be thus bred up with a [[desire]] of [[conquest]]? the very epithet, used
in this sense, gives me a sickly qualm!  does [[religion]] and virtue
offer no stronger motives, no brighter [[reward]]?  must they always be
debased by being made to consider the [[sex]] of their companions?
must they be taught always to be pleasing?  and when levelling
their small artillery at the [[heart]] of [[man]], is it necessary to tell
them that a little sense is sufficient to render their attention
incredibly soothing?  "as a small [[degree]] of [[knowledge]] entertains in
a woman, so from a woman, though for a different [[reason]], a small
expression of [[kindness]] delights, particularly if she have beauty!"
i should have supposed for the same [[reason]].

why are girls to be told that they resemble angels; but to sink
them below [[women]]?  or, that a gentle, [[innocent]] female is an object
that comes nearer to the [[idea]] which we have formed of angels than
any other.  yet they are told, at the same [[time]], that they are only
like angels when they are [[young]] and beautiful; consequently, it is
their persons [[person]], not their virtues [[virtue]], that procure them this homage.

idle empty words!  what can such delusive [[flattery]] lead to, but
vanity and folly?  the lover, it is true, has a poetic licence to
exalt his mistress; his [[reason]] is the bubble of his passion, and he
does not utter a falsehood when he borrows the [[language]] of
adoration.  his [[imagination]] may raise the idol of his [[heart]],
unblamed, above [[humanity]]; and [[happy]] would it be for [[women]], if they
were only flattered by the [[men]] who loved them; i mean, who [[love]] the
individual, not the [[sex]]; but should a grave preacher interlard his
discourses with such fooleries?

in sermons or novels, however, voluptuousness is always true to its
text.  [[men]] are allowed by moralists to cultivate, as nature
directs, different qualities, and assume the different characters [[character]],
that the same [[passions]], modified almost to infinity, give to each
individual.  a [[virtuous]] [[man]] may have a choleric or a sanguine
constitution, be [[gay]] or grave, unreproved; be firm till be is
almost over-bearing, or, weakly submissive, have no will or opinion
of his own; but all [[women]] are to be levelled, by meekness and
docility, into one [[character]] of yielding softness and gentle
compliance.

i will use the preacher's own words.  "let it be observed, that in
your [[sex]] manly exercises are never graceful; that in them a tone
and figure, as well as an air and deportment, of the masculine
kind, are always forbidding; and that [[men]] of sensibility [[desire]] in
every woman soft features, and a flowing voice, a form not robust,
and demeanour delicate and gentle."

is not the following portrait--the portrait of a house [[slave]]?  "i
am astonished at the folly of many [[women]], who are still reproaching
their husbands for leaving them alone, for preferring this or that
company to theirs, for treating them with this and the other mark
of disregard or indifference; when, to speak the [[truth]], they have
themselves in a [[great]] measure to blame.  not that i would justify
the [[men]] in any thing [[wrong]] on their part.  but had you behaved to
them with more respectful observance, and a more [[equal]] tenderness;
studying their humours [[humour]], overlooking their mistakes, submitting to
their opinions [[opinion]] in matters indifferent, passing by little instances
of unevenness, caprice, or passion, giving soft answers [[answer]] to hasty
words, complaining as seldom as possible, and making it your daily
care to relieve their anxieties and prevent their wishes [[wish]], to
enliven the hour of dulness, and call up the ideas [[idea]] of felicity:
had you pursued this conduct, i [[doubt]] not but you would have
maintained and even increased their esteem, so far as to have
secured every [[degree]] of influence that could conduce to their
virtue, or your mutual satisfaction; and your house might at this
day have been the abode of domestic bliss."  such a woman ought to
be an angel--or she is an ass--for i discern not a trace of the
human [[character]], neither [[reason]] nor passion in this domestic
drudge, whose being is absorbed in that of a tyrant's.

still dr. fordyce must have very little acquaintance with the human
heart, if he really supposed that such conduct would bring back
wandering [[love]], instead of exciting contempt.  no, [[beauty]],
gentleness, etc. etc. may gain a [[heart]]; but esteem, the only
lasting affection, can alone be obtained by [[virtue]] supported by
reason.  it is [[respect]] for the understanding that keeps alive
tenderness for the [[person]].

as these volumes are so frequently put into the hands of young
people, i have taken more notice of them than strictly speaking,
they deserve; but as they have contributed to vitiate the taste,
and enervate the understanding of many of my fellow-creatures, i
could not pass them silently over.

section 5.3.

such paternal solicitude pervades dr. gregory's legacy to his
daughters, that i enter on the task of criticism with affectionate
respect; but as this little volume has many attractions to
recommend it to the notice of the most respectable part of my [[sex]],
i cannot silently pass over arguments that so speciously support
opinions which, i [[think]], have had the most baneful effect on the
morals and manners of the female [[world]].

his easy familiar style is particularly suited to the tenor of his
advice, and the melancholy tenderness which his [[respect]] for the
memory of a beloved [[wife]] diffuses through the whole [[work]], renders
it very interesting; yet there is a [[degree]] of concise elegance
conspicuous in many passages, that disturbs this sympathy; and we
pop on the author, when we only expected to meet the--father.

besides, having two objects in view, he seldom adhered steadily to
either; for, wishing to make his daughters [[daughter]] amiable, and fearing
lest unhappiness should only be the consequence, of instilling
sentiments, that might draw them out of the track of [[common]] [[life]],
without enabling them to act with consonant independence and
dignity, he checks the [[natural]] flow of his thoughts [[thought]], and neither
advises one thing nor the other.

in the preface he tells them a mournful [[truth]], "that they will
hear, at least once in their lives [[life]], the [[genuine]] sentiments of a
man, who has no interest in deceiving them."

hapless woman! what can be expected from thee, when the beings on
whom thou art [[arts]] said naturally to depend for [[reason]] and support, have
all an interest in deceiving thee!  this is the root of the evil
that has shed a corroding mildew on all thy virtues [[virtue]]; and blighting
in the bud thy opening faculties, has rendered thee the [[weak]] thing
thou art!  it is this separate interest-- this insidious [[state]] of
warfare, that undermines morality, and divides mankind!

if [[love]] has made some [[women]] wretched--how many more has the cold
unmeaning intercourse of gallantry rendered [[vain]] and useless! yet
this heartless attention to the [[sex]] is reckoned so manly, so
polite, that till [[society]] is very differently organized, i [[fear]],
this vestige of gothic manners will not be done away by a more
reasonable and affectionate mode of conduct.  besides, to strip it
of its imaginary [[dignity]], i must observe, that in the most
civilized [[european]] states, this lip-service prevails in a very
great [[degree]], accompanied with extreme dissoluteness of morals [[moral]].  in
portugal, the [[country]] that i particularly allude to, it takes place
of the most serious [[moral]] obligations; for a [[man]] is seldom
assassinated when in the company of a woman.  the savage hand of
rapine is unnerved by this chivalrous spirit; and, if the stroke of
vengeance cannot be stayed--the [[lady]] is entreated to pardon the
rudeness and depart in [[peace]], though sprinkled, perhaps, with her
husband's or brother's [[blood]].

i shall pass over his strictures on [[religion]], because i mean to
discuss that [[subject]] in a separate [[chapter]].

the remarks relative to behaviour, though many of them very
sensible, i entirely disapprove of, because it appears to me to be
beginning, as it were at the [[wrong]] end.  a cultivated
understanding, and an affectionate [[heart]], will never want starched
rules of decorum, something more substantial than seemliness will
be the result; and, without understanding, the behaviour here
recommended, would be rank affectation.  decorum, indeed, is the
one thing needful!  decorum is to supplant [[nature]], and banish all
simplicity and variety of [[character]] out of the female [[world]].  yet
what [[good]] end can all this superficial counsel [[produce]]?  it is,
however, much easier to point out this or that mode of behaviour,
than to set the [[reason]] to [[work]]; but, when the [[mind]] has been stored
with useful [[knowledge]], and strengthened by being employed, the
regulation of the behaviour may safely be left to its guidance.

why, for instance, should the following caution be given, when art
of every [[kind]] must contaminate the [[mind]]; and why entangle the grand
motives of action, which [[reason]] and [[religion]] equally combine to
enforce, with pitiful worldly shifts and slight of hand tricks to
gain the applause of gaping tasteless fools [[fool]]?  "be even cautious in
displaying your [[good]] sense.*  it will be [[thought]] you assume a
superiority over the rest of the company-- but if you happen to
have any learning keep it a profound secret, especially from the
men, who generally look with a [[jealous]] and malignant eye on a woman
of [[great]] parts, and a cultivated understanding."  if [[men]] of real
merit, as he afterwards observes, are superior to this meanness,
where is the necessity that the behaviour of the whole [[sex]] should
be modulated to please fools [[fool]], or [[men]], who having little claim to
respect as individuals [[individual]], choose to keep close in their phalanx.
men, indeed, who insist on their [[common]] superiority, having only
this [[sexual]] superiority, are certainly very excusable.

(*footnote.  let [[women]] once acquire [[good]] sense--and if it deserve
the name, it will [[teach]] them; or, of what use will it be how to
employ it.)

there would be no end to rules [[rule]] for behaviour, if it be proper
always to adopt the tone of the company; for thus, for ever varying
the key, a flat would often pass for a [[natural]] note.

surely it would have been wiser to have advised [[women]] to improve
themselves till they rose above the fumes of vanity; and then to
let the [[public]] [[opinion]] come round--for where are rules [[rule]] of
accommodation to stop?  the narrow path of [[truth]] and virtue
inclines neither to the [[right]] nor left, it is a straight-forward
business, and they who are earnestly pursuing their road, may bound
over many decorous prejudices, without leaving modesty behind.
make the [[heart]] clean, and give the head employment, and i will
venture to predict that there will be nothing offensive in the
behaviour.

the air of [[fashion]], which many [[young]] [[people]] are so eager to attain,
always strikes me like the [[studied]] attitudes of some [[modern]] prints,
copied with tasteless servility after the antiques; the [[soul]] is
left out, and none of the parts are tied together by what may
properly be termed [[character]].  this varnish of [[fashion]], which
seldom sticks very close to sense, may dazzle the [[weak]]; but leave
nature to itself, and it will seldom disgust the [[wise]].  besides,
when a woman has sufficient sense not to pretend to any thing which
she does not [[understand]] in some [[degree]], there is no need of
determining to hide her [[talents]] under a bushel.  let things take
their [[natural]] course, and all will be well.

it is this [[system]] of dissimulation, throughout the volume, that i
despise.  [[women]] are always to seem to be this and that--yet virtue
might apostrophize them, in the words of hamlet--seems!  i [[know]] not
seems!--have that within that passeth show!--

still the same tone occurs; for in another place, after
recommending, (without sufficiently discriminating) delicacy, he
adds, "the [[men]] will [[complain]] of your reserve.  they will assure you
that a franker behaviour would make you more amiable.  but, trust
me, they are not sincere when they tell you so.  i acknowledge that
on some occasions [[occasion]] it might render you more agreeable as companions,
but it would make you less amiable as [[women]]:  an important
distinction, which many of your [[sex]] are not aware of."

this [[desire]] of being always [[women]], is the very [[consciousness]] that
degrades the [[sex]].  excepting with a lover, i must repeat with
emphasis, a former observation--it would be well if they were only
agreeable or [[rational]] companions.  but in this [[respect]] his advice
is even inconsistent with a passage which i mean to quote with the
most marked approbation.

"the sentiment, that a woman may allow all [[innocent]] freedoms,
provided her [[virtue]] is secure, is both grossly indelicate and
dangerous, and has proved fatal to many of your [[sex]]."  with this
opinion i perfectly coincide.  a [[man]], or a woman, of any feeling
must always [[wish]] to convince a beloved object that it is the
caresses of the [[individual]], not the [[sex]], that is received and
returned with [[pleasure]]; and, that the [[heart]], rather than the
senses, is moved.  without this [[natural]] delicacy, [[love]] becomes a
selfish personal gratification that soon degrades the [[character]].

i carry this sentiment still further.  affection, when [[love]] is out
of the [[question]], authorises many personal endearments, that
naturally flowing from an [[innocent]] [[heart]] give [[life]] to the
behaviour; but the personal intercourse of appetite, gallantry, or
vanity, is despicable.  when a [[man]] squeezes the hand of a pretty
woman, handing her to a carriage, whom he has never seen before,
she will consider such an impertinent [[freedom]] in the [[light]] of an
insult, if she have any true delicacy, instead of being flattered
by this unmeaning homage to [[beauty]].  these are the privileges [[privilege]] of
friendship, or the momentary homage which the [[heart]] pays [[pay]] to [[virtue]],
when it flashes suddenly on the notice--mere animal spirits have no
claim to the kindnesses of affection.

wishing to feed the affections with what is now the food of vanity,
i would fain persuade my [[sex]] to act from simpler principles [[principle]].  let
them [[merit]] [[love]], and they will obtain it, though they may never be
told that:  "the [[power]] of a fine woman over the hearts [[heart]] of [[men]], of
men of the finest parts, is even beyond what she conceives."

i have already noticed the narrow cautions with [[respect]] to
duplicity, female softness, delicacy of [[constitution]]; for these are
the changes [[change]] which he rings round without ceasing, in a more
decorous manner, it is true, than [[rousseau]]; but it all comes home
to the same point, and whoever is at the trouble to analyze these
sentiments, will find the first principles [[principle]] not quite so delicate as
the superstructure.

the [[subject]] of amusements is treated in too cursory a manner; but
with the same spirit.

when i treat of [[friendship]], [[love]], and [[marriage]], it will be found
that we materially differ in [[opinion]]; i shall not then forestall
what i have to observe on these important subjects [[subject]]; but confine my
remarks to the general tenor of them, to that cautious family
prudence, to those confined views of partial unenlightened
affection, which exclude [[pleasure]] and improvement, by vainly
wishing to ward off [[sorrow]] and error--and by thus guarding the
heart and [[mind]], [[destroy]] also all their energy.  it is far [[better]] to
be often deceived than never to trust; to be disappointed in [[love]],
than never to [[love]]; to lose a husband's fondness, than forfeit his
esteem.

happy would it be for the [[world]], and for individuals [[individual]], of course, if
all this unavailing solicitude to attain worldly [[happiness]], on a
confined plan, were turned into an anxious [[desire]] to improve the
understanding.  "wisdom is the principal thing:  therefore get
wisdom; and with all thy gettings get understanding."  "how long ye
simple ones, will ye [[love]] simplicity, and hate [[knowledge]]?"  saith
wisdom to the daughters [[daughter]] of men!

section 5.4.

i do not mean to allude to all the writers who have written on the
subject of female manners--it would in [[fact]] be only beating over
the old ground, for they have, in general, written in the same
strain; but attacking the boasted prerogative of man--the
prerogative that may emphatically be called the iron sceptre of
tyranny, the original [[sin]] of tyrants [[tyrant]], i declare against all power
built on prejudices, however hoary.

if the submission demanded be founded on justice--there is no
appealing to a higher power--for [[god]] is [[justice]] itself.  let us
then, as [[children]] of the same parent, if not bastardized by being
the younger born, [[reason]] together, and learn to submit to the
authority of [[reason]] when her voice is distinctly heard.  but, if it
be proved that this [[throne]] of prerogative only rests on a chaotic
mass of prejudices, that have no inherent [[principle]] of order to
keep them together, or on an elephant, tortoise, or even the mighty
shoulders of a [[son]] of the [[earth]], they may escape, who dare to brave
the consequence without any breach of [[duty]], without sinning against
the order of things.

whilst [[reason]] raises [[man]] above the brutal herd, and [[death]] is big
with promises, they alone are [[subject]] to blind [[authority]] who have
no reliance on their own [[strength]].  "they are [[free]] who will be
free!"*

(*footnote.  "he is the [[free]] [[man]], whom [[truth]] makes free!"  cowper.)

the being who can govern itself, has nothing to [[fear]] in [[life]]; but
if any thing is dearer than its own [[respect]], the price must be paid
to the [[last]] farthing.  [[virtue]], like every thing valuable, must be
loved for herself alone; or she will not take up her abode with us.
she will not impart that [[peace]], "which passeth understanding," when
she is merely made the stilts of [[reputation]] and respected with
pharisaical exactness, because "honesty is the [[best]] policy."

that the plan of [[life]] which enables us to carry some [[knowledge]] and
virtue into another [[world]], is the one [[best]] calculated to ensure
content in this, cannot be denied; yet few [[people]] act according to
this [[principle]], though it be universally allowed that it admits not
of dispute.  [[present]] [[pleasure]], or [[present]] [[power]], carry before it
these sober convictions; and it is for the day, not for [[life]], that
man bargains with [[happiness]].  how few! how very few! have
sufficient foresight or resolution, to endure a small [[evil]] at the
moment, to avoid a greater hereafter.

woman in particular, whose virtue* is built on mutual prejudices,
seldom attains to this greatness of [[mind]]; so that, becoming the
slave of her own feelings, she is easily subjugated by those of
others.  thus degraded, her [[reason]], her misty reason! is employed
rather to burnish than to snap her chains.

(*footnote.  i mean to use a word that comprehends more than
chastity, the [[sexual]] [[virtue]].)

indignantly have i heard [[women]] argue in the same track as [[men]], and
adopt the sentiments that brutalize them with all the pertinacity
of ignorance.

i must illustrate my assertion by a few examples [[example]].  mrs. piozzi, who
often repeated by rote, what she did not [[understand]], comes forward
with johnsonian periods.

"seek not for [[happiness]] in singularity; and dread a refinement of
wisdom as a deviation into folly."  thus she dogmatically addresses
a new [[married]] [[man]]; and to elucidate this pompous exordium, she
adds, "i said that the [[person]] of your [[lady]] would not grow more
pleasing to you, but [[pray]] let her never suspect that it grows less
so:  that a woman will pardon an affront to her understanding much
sooner than one to her [[person]], is well known; nor will any of us
contradict the assertion.  all our attainments, all our [[arts]], are
employed to gain and keep the [[heart]] of [[man]]; and what mortification
can exceed the disappointment, if the end be not obtained: there is
no reproof however pointed, no [[punishment]] however severe, that a
woman of spirit will not prefer to neglect; and if she can endure
it without complaint, it only proves that she means to make herself
amends by the attention of others for the slights of her husband!"

these are true masculine sentiments.  "all our [[arts]] are employed to
gain and keep the [[heart]] of [[man]]:"--and what is the inference?--if
her [[person]], and was there ever a [[person]], though formed with
medicisan symmetry, that was not slighted? be neglected, she will
make herself amends by endeavouring to please other [[men]].  noble
morality!  but thus is the understanding of the whole sex
affronted, and their [[virtue]] deprived of the [[common]] basis of [[virtue]].
a woman must [[know]], that her [[person]] cannot be as pleasing to her
husband as it was to her lover, and if she be offended with him for
being a [[human]] creature, she may as well whine about the loss of his
heart as about any other foolish thing.  and this very want of
discernment or unreasonable anger, proves that he could not change
his fondness for her [[person]] into affection for her virtues [[virtue]] or
respect for her understanding.

whilst [[women]] avow, and act up to such opinions [[opinion]], their
understandings, at least, deserve the contempt and obloquy that
men, who never insult their persons [[person]], have pointedly levelled at the
female [[mind]].  and it is the sentiments of these polite [[men]], who do
not [[wish]] to be encumbered with [[mind]], that [[vain]] [[women]] thoughtlessly
adopt.  yet they should [[know]], that insulted [[reason]] alone can spread
that [[sacred]] reserve about the persons [[person]] which renders human
affections, for [[human]] affections have always some base alloy, as
permanent as is consistent with the grand end of existence--the
attainment of [[virtue]].

the baroness de stael speaks the same [[language]] as the [[lady]] just
cited, with more enthusiasm.  her eulogium on [[rousseau]] was
accidentally put into my hands, and her sentiments, the sentiments
of too many of my [[sex]], may serve as the text for a few comments.
"though [[rousseau]]," she observes, "has endeavoured to prevent women
from interfering in [[public]] affairs, and acting a brilliant part in
the theatre of [[politics]]; yet, in speaking of them, how much has he
done it to their satisfaction!  if he wished to deprive them of
some rights [[right]], [[foreign]] to their [[sex]], how has he for ever restored to
them all those to which it has a claim!  and in attempting to
diminish their influence over the deliberations of [[men]], how
sacredly has he established the [[empire]] they have over their
happiness!  in aiding them to descend from an usurped [[throne]], he
has firmly seated them upon that to which they were destined by
nature; and though he be full of indignation against them when they
endeavour to resemble [[men]], yet when they come before him with all
the charms weaknesses, virtues [[virtue]], and errors, of their [[sex]], his
respect for their persons [[person]] amounts almost to adoration."  true!--for
never was there a sensualist who paid more fervent adoration at the
shrine of [[beauty]].  so devout, indeed, was his [[respect]] for the
person, that excepting the [[virtue]] of chastity, for obvious reasons [[reason]],
he only wished to see it embellished by charms, weaknesses, and
errors.  he was afraid lest the austerity of [[reason]] should disturb
the soft playfulness of [[love]].  the master wished to have a
meretricious [[slave]] to fondle, entirely dependent on his [[reason]] and
bounty; he did not want a companion, whom he should be compelled to
esteem, or a friend to whom he could confide the [[care]] of his
children's [[education]], should [[death]] deprive them of their [[father]],
before he had fulfilled the [[sacred]] task.  he denies woman [[reason]],
shuts her out from [[knowledge]], and turns her aside from [[truth]]; yet
his pardon is granted, because, "he admits the passion of [[love]]."
it would require some ingenuity to show why [[women]] were to be under
such an obligation to him for thus admitting [[love]]; when it is clear
that he admits it only for the relaxation of [[men]], and to perpetuate
the [[species]]; but he talked with passion, and that powerful spell
worked on the sensibility of a [[young]] encomiast.  "what signifies
it," pursues this rhapsodist, "to [[women]], that his [[reason]] disputes
with them the [[empire]], when his [[heart]] is devotedly theirs."  it is
not empire--but equality, that they should contend for.  yet, if
they only wished to lengthen out their sway, they should not
entirely trust to their persons [[person]], for though [[beauty]] may gain a
heart, it cannot keep it, even while the [[beauty]] is in full bloom,
unless the [[mind]] lend, at least, some graces.

when [[women]] are once sufficiently enlightened to discover their real
interest, on a grand scale, they will, i am persuaded, be very
ready to resign all the prerogatives of [[love]], that are not mutual,
(speaking of them as lasting prerogatives,) for the calm
satisfaction of [[friendship]], and the tender confidence of habitual
esteem.  before [[marriage]] they will not assume any insolent airs,
nor afterward abjectly submit; but, endeavouring to act like
reasonable creatures, in both situations, they will not be tumbled
from a [[throne]] to a stool.

madame genlis has written several entertaining books [[book]] for [[children]];
and her letters on [[education]] afford many useful hints, that
sensible parents will certainly avail themselves of; but her views
are narrow, and her prejudices as unreasonable as [[strong]].

i shall pass over her vehement argument in favour of the eternity
of future punishments [[punishment]], because i blush to [[think]] that a [[human]] being
should ever argue vehemently in such a cause, and only make a few
remarks on her absurd manner of making the parental authority
supplant [[reason]].  for every where does she inculcate not only blind
submission to parents; but to the [[opinion]] of the [[world]].*

(*footnote.  a [[person]] is not to act in this or that way, though
convinced they are [[right]] in so doing, because some equivocal
circumstances may lead the [[world]] to suspect that they acted from
different motives.  this is sacrificing the substance for a shadow.
let [[people]] but watch their own hearts [[heart]], and act rightly as far as
they can [[judge]], and they may patiently wait till the [[opinion]] of the
world comes round.  it is [[best]] to be directed by a simple
motive--for [[justice]] has too often been sacrificed to
propriety;--another word for convenience.)

she tells a story of a [[young]] [[man]] engaged by his father's express
desire to a girl of [[fortune]].  before the [[marriage]] could take place
she is deprived of her [[fortune]], and thrown friendless on the [[world]].
the [[father]] practises the most infamous [[arts]] to separate his son
from her, and when the [[son]] detects his villany, and, following the
dictates of [[honour]], marries the girl, nothing but misery ensues,
because forsooth he [[married]] without his father's [[consent]].  on what
ground can [[religion]] or morality rest, when [[justice]] is thus set at
defiance?  in the same style she represents an accomplished young
woman, as ready to [[marry]] any [[body]] that her mamma pleased to
recommend; and, as actually marrying the [[young]] [[man]] of her own
choice, without feeling any emotions of passion, because that a
well educated girl had not [[time]] to be in [[love]].  is it possible to
have much [[respect]] for a [[system]] of [[education]] that thus insults
reason and [[nature]]?

many similar opinions [[opinion]] occur in her writings, mixed with sentiments
that do [[honour]] to her head and [[heart]].  yet so much superstition is
mixed with her [[religion]], and so much worldly [[wisdom]] with her
morality, that i should not let a [[young]] [[person]] [[read]] her works [[work]],
unless i could afterwards converse on the subjects [[subject]], and point out
the contradictions.

mrs. chapone's letters are written with such [[good]] sense, and
unaffected [[humility]], and contain so many useful observations, that
i only mention them to [[pay]] the worthy writer this tribute of
respect.  i cannot, it is true, always coincide in [[opinion]] with
her; but i always [[respect]] her.

the very word [[respect]] brings mrs. macaulay to my remembrance.  the
woman of the [[greatest]] abilities, undoubtedly, that this [[country]] has
ever produced.  and yet this woman has been [[suffered]] to [[die]] without
sufficient [[respect]] being paid to her memory.

posterity, however, will be more just; and [[remember]] that catharine
macaulay was an [[example]] of intellectual acquirements supposed to be
incompatible with the weakness of her [[sex]].  in her style of
writing, indeed, no [[sex]] appears, for it is like the sense it
conveys, [[strong]] and clear.

i will not call her's a masculine understanding, because i admit
not of such an arrogant assumption of [[reason]]; but i contend that it
was a sound one, and that her [[judgment]], the matured fruit of
profound thinking, was a proof that a woman can acquire [[judgment]],
in the full extent of the word.  possessing more penetration than
sagacity, more understanding than fancy, she writes with sober
energy, and argumentative closeness; yet sympathy and benevolence
give an interest to her sentiments, and that vital heat to
arguments, which forces [[force]] the reader to weigh them.*

(*footnote.  coinciding in [[opinion]] with mrs. macaulay relative to
many branches of [[education]], i refer to her valuable [[work]], instead
of quoting her sentiments to support my own.)

when i first [[thought]] of writing these strictures i anticipated mrs.
macaulay's approbation with a little of that sanguine ardour which
it has been the [[business]] of my [[life]] to depress; but soon heard with
the sickly qualm of disappointed [[hope]], and the still seriousness of
regret--that she was no more!

section 5.5.

taking a view of the different works [[work]] which have been written on
education, [[lord]] chesterfield's letters must not be silently passed
over.  not that i mean to analyze his unmanly, immoral [[system]], or
even to cull any of the useful shrewd remarks which occur in his
frivolous correspondence--no, i only mean to make a few reflections
on the avowed tendency of them--the art [[arts]] of acquiring an early
knowledge of the [[world]].  an art [[arts]], i will venture to assert, that
preys secretly, like the worm in the bud, on the expanding powers [[power]],
and turns to poison the generous juices which should mount with
vigour in the youthful frame, inspiring warm affections and great
resolves.

for every thing, saith the [[wise]] [[man]], there is [[reason]]; and who would
look for the fruits of autumn during the genial months of spring?
but this is mere declamation, and i mean to [[reason]] with those
worldly-wise instructors, who, instead of cultivating the [[judgment]],
instil prejudices, and render hard the [[heart]] that gradual
experience would only have cooled.  an early acquaintance with
human infirmities; or, what is termed [[knowledge]] of the [[world]], is
the surest way, in my [[opinion]], to contract the [[heart]] and damp the
natural youthful ardour which produces [[produce]] not only [[great]] [[talents]], but
great virtues [[virtue]].  for the [[vain]] attempt to bring forth the fruit of
experience, before the sapling has thrown out its leaves, only
exhausts its [[strength]], and prevents its assuming a [[natural]] form;
just as the form and [[strength]] of subsiding metals are injured when
the attraction of cohesion is disturbed.  tell me, ye who have
studied the [[human]] [[mind]], is it not a [[strange]] way to fix principles
by showing [[young]] [[people]] that they are seldom stable?  and how can
they be fortified by habits when they are proved to be fallacious
by [[example]]?  why is the ardour of [[youth]] thus to be damped, and the
luxuriancy of fancy cut to the quick?  this dry caution may, it is
true, guard a [[character]] from worldly mischances; but will
infallibly preclude excellence in either [[virtue]] or [[knowledge]].  the
stumbling-block thrown across every path by suspicion, will prevent
any vigorous exertions of genius or benevolence, and [[life]] will be
stripped of its most alluring charm long before its calm evening,
when [[man]] should retire to contemplation for comfort and support.

a [[young]] [[man]] who has been bred up with domestic [[friends]], and [[led]] to
store his [[mind]] with as much speculative [[knowledge]] as can be
acquired by reading and the [[natural]] reflections which youthful
ebullitions of animal spirits and instinctive feelings inspire,
will enter the [[world]] with warm and erroneous expectations.  but
this appears to be the course of [[nature]]; and in morals [[moral]], as well as
in works [[work]] of taste, we should be observant of her sacred
indications, and not presume to lead when we ought obsequiously to
follow.

in the [[world]] few [[people]] act from [[principle]]; [[present]] feelings, and
early habits, are the grand springs:  but how would the former be
deadened, and the latter rendered iron corroding fetters, if the
world were shown to [[young]] [[people]] just as it is; when no knowledge
of [[mankind]] or their own hearts [[heart]], slowly obtained by experience
rendered them forbearing?  their fellow creatures would not then be
viewed as frail beings; like themselves, condemned to struggle with
human infirmities, and sometimes displaying the [[light]] and sometimes
the dark side of their [[character]]; extorting alternate feelings of
love and disgust; but guarded against as beasts of prey, till every
enlarged social feeling, in a word--humanity, was eradicated.

in [[life]], on the contrary, as we gradually discover the
imperfections of our [[nature]], we discover virtues [[virtue]], and various
circumstances attach us to our fellow creatures, when we mix with
them, and view the same objects, that are never [[thought]] of in
acquiring a hasty unnatural [[knowledge]] of the [[world]].  we see a folly
swell into a [[vice]], by almost imperceptible degrees [[degree]], and [[pity]] while
we blame; but, if the hideous monster burst suddenly on our sight,
fear and disgust rendering us more severe than [[man]] ought to be,
might lead us with blind zeal to usurp the [[character]] of
omnipotence, and denounce damnation on our fellow mortals,
forgetting that we cannot [[read]] the [[heart]], and that we have seeds of
the same vices [[vice]] lurking in our own.

i have already remarked, that we expect more from instruction, than
mere instruction can [[produce]]:  for, instead of preparing young
people to encounter the evils [[evil]] of [[life]] with [[dignity]], and to acquire
wisdom and [[virtue]] by the exercise of their own faculties, precepts
are heaped upon precepts, and blind [[obedience]] required, when
conviction should be brought [[home]] to [[reason]].

suppose, for instance, that a [[young]] [[person]] in the first ardour of
friendship deifies the beloved object--what harm can arise from
this mistaken enthusiastic attachment?  perhaps it is necessary for
virtue first to appear in a [[human]] form to impress youthful hearts [[heart]];
the ideal model, which a more matured and exalted [[mind]] looks up to,
and shapes for itself, would elude their sight.  he who loves [[love]] not
his [[brother]] whom he hath seen, how can he [[love]] [[god]]? [[asked]] the
wisest of [[men]].

it is [[natural]] for [[youth]] to adorn the first object of its affection
with every [[good]] quality, and the emulation produced by ignorance,
or, to speak with more propriety, by inexperience, brings forward
the [[mind]] capable of forming such an affection, and when, in the
lapse of [[time]], [[perfection]] is found not to be within the reach of
mortals, [[virtue]], abstractly, is [[thought]] beautiful, and wisdom
sublime.  admiration then gives place to [[friendship]], properly so
called, because it is cemented by esteem; and the being walks alone
only dependent on [[heaven]] for that emulous panting after perfection
which ever glows in a [[noble]] [[mind]].  but this [[knowledge]] a [[man]] must
gain by the exertion of his own faculties; and this is surely the
blessed fruit of disappointed hope! for he who delighteth to
diffuse [[happiness]] and show [[mercy]] to the [[weak]] creatures, who are
learning to [[know]] him, never implanted a [[good]] propensity to be a
tormenting ignis fatuus.

our trees are now allowed to spread with wild luxuriance, nor do we
expect by [[force]] to combine the majestic marks of [[time]] with youthful
graces; but wait patiently till they have struck deep their root,
and braved many a storm.  is the [[mind]] then, which, in proportion to
its [[dignity]] advances more slowly towards [[perfection]], to be treated
with less [[respect]]?  to argue from analogy, every thing around us is
in a progressive [[state]]; and when an unwelcome [[knowledge]] of life
produces almost a satiety of [[life]], and we discover by the natural
course of things that all that is done under the sun is vanity, we
are drawing near the awful close of the drama.  the days of
activity and [[hope]] are over, and the opportunities which the first
stage of existence has afforded of advancing in the scale of
intelligence, must soon be summed up.  a [[knowledge]] at this period
of the futility of [[life]], or earlier, if obtained by [[experience]], is
very useful, because it is [[natural]]; but when a frail being is shown
the follies and vices [[vice]] of [[man]], that he may be taught prudently to
guard against the [[common]] casualties of [[life]] by sacrificing his
heart--surely it is not speaking harshly to call it the [[wisdom]] of
this [[world]], contrasted with the nobler fruit of piety and
experience.

i will venture a paradox, and deliver my [[opinion]] without reserve;
if [[men]] were only born to form a circle of [[life]] and [[death]], it would
be [[wise]] to take every step that foresight could suggest to render
life [[happy]].  moderation in every pursuit would then be supreme
wisdom; and the prudent voluptuary might enjoy a [[degree]] of content,
though he neither cultivated his understanding nor kept his heart
pure.  prudence, supposing we were mortal, would be true [[wisdom]],
or, to be more explicit, would procure the [[greatest]] portion of
happiness, considering the whole of [[life]]; but [[knowledge]] beyond the
conveniences of [[life]] would be a curse.

why should we injure our health by close study?  the exalted
pleasure which intellectual pursuits afford would scarcely be
equivalent to the hours of languor that [[follow]]; especially, if it
be necessary to take into the reckoning the doubts [[doubt]] and
disappointments that cloud our researches.  vanity and vexation
close every inquiry:  for the cause which we particularly wished to
discover flies like the horizon before us as we advance.  the
ignorant, on the contrary, resemble [[children]], and suppose, that if
they could walk straight forward they should at [[last]] arrive where
the [[earth]] and clouds meet.  yet, disappointed as we are in our
researches, the [[mind]] gains [[strength]] by the exercise, sufficient,
perhaps, to comprehend the answers [[answer]] which, in another step of
existence, it may receive to the anxious questions [[question]] it [[asked]], when
the understanding with feeble wing was fluttering round the visible
effects to dive into the hidden cause.

the [[passions]] also, the winds of [[life]], would be useless, if not
injurious, did the substance which composes our thinking being,
after we have [[thought]] in [[vain]], only become the support of vegetable
life, and invigorate a cabbage, or blush in a rose.  the appetites
would [[answer]] every earthly [[purpose]], and [[produce]] more moderate and
permanent [[happiness]].  but the powers [[power]] of the [[soul]] that are of little
use here, and, probably, disturb our animal enjoyments, even while
conscious [[dignity]] makes us [[glory]] in possessing them, prove that
life is merely an [[education]], a [[state]] of infancy, of which the only
hopes worth cherishing should not be sacrificed.  i mean, therefore
to infer, that we ought to have a precise [[idea]] of what we [[wish]] to
attain by [[education]], for the immortality of the [[soul]] is
contradicted by the actions of many [[people]], who firmly profess the
belief.

if you mean to secure ease and [[prosperity]] on [[earth]] as the first
consideration, and leave futurity to provide for itself, you act
prudently in giving your child an early insight into the weaknesses
of his [[nature]].  you may not, it is true, make an inkle of him; but
do not imagine that he will stick to more than the letter of the
law, who has very early imbibed a mean [[opinion]] of [[human]] [[nature]]; nor
will he [[think]] it necessary to rise much above the [[common]] standard.
he may avoid gross vices [[vice]], because honesty is the [[best]] policy; but
he will never aim at attaining [[great]] virtues [[virtue]].  the [[example]] of
writers and artists will illustrate this remark.

i must therefore venture to [[doubt]], whether what has been [[thought]] an
axiom in morals [[moral]], may not have been a dogmatical assertion made by
men who have coolly seen [[mankind]] through the medium of books [[book]], and
say, in direct contradiction to them, that the regulation of the
passions is not always [[wisdom]].  on the contrary, it should seem,
that one [[reason]] why [[men]] have superiour [[judgment]] and more fortitude
than [[women]], is undoubtedly this, that they give a freer scope to
the grand [[passions]], and by more frequently going astray, enlarge
their minds [[mind]].  if then by the exercise of their own [[reason]], they fix
on some stable [[principle]], they have probably to thank the [[force]] of
their [[passions]], nourished by false views of [[life]], and permitted to
overleap the boundary that secures content.  but if, in the dawn of
life, we could soberly survey the scenes before us as in
perspective, and see every thing in its true colours, how could the
passions gain sufficient [[strength]] to unfold the faculties?

let me now, as from an eminence, survey the [[world]] stripped of all
its false delusive charms.  the clear atmosphere enables me to see
each object in its true point of view, while my [[heart]] is still.  i
am calm as the prospect in a morning when the mists, slowly
dispersing, silently unveil the beauties [[beauty]] of [[nature]], refreshed by
rest.

in what [[light]] will the [[world]] now appear?  i rub my [[eyes]] and [[think]],
perchance, that i am just awaking from a lively [[dream]].

i see the sons [[son]] and daughters [[daughter]] of [[men]] pursuing shadows, and anxiously
wasting their powers [[power]] to feed [[passions]] which have no adequate
object--if the very excess of these blind impulses pampered by that
lying, yet constantly-trusted guide, the [[imagination]], did not, by
preparing them for some other [[state]], render short sighted mortals
wiser without their own concurrence; or, what comes to the same
thing, when they were pursuing some imaginary [[present]] [[good]].

after viewing objects in this [[light]], it would not be very fanciful
to imagine, that this [[world]] was a stage on which a pantomime is
daily performed for the amusement of superiour beings.  how would
they be diverted to see the ambitious [[man]] consuming himself by
running after a phantom, and, pursuing the bubble fame in "the
cannon's mouth" that was to blow him to nothing:  for when
consciousness is lost, it matters not whether we mount in a
whirlwind or descend in rain.  and should they compassionately
invigorate his sight, and show him the thorny path which [[led]] to
eminence, that like a quicksand sinks as he ascends, disappointing
his hopes [[hope]] when almost within his grasp, would he not leave to
others the [[honour]] of amusing them, and [[labour]] to secure the present
moment, though from the [[constitution]] of his [[nature]] he would not
find it very easy to catch the flying stream?  such slaves [[slave]] are we
to [[hope]] and fear!

but, [[vain]] as the ambitious man's [[man]] pursuit would be, he is often
striving for something more substantial than fame--that indeed
would be the veriest meteor, the wildest [[fire]] that could lure a man
to ruin.  what! renounce the most trifling gratification to be
applauded when he should be no more! wherefore this struggle,
whether [[man]] is mortal or [[immortal]], if that [[noble]] passion did not
really raise the being above his fellows?

and love!  what diverting scenes would it produce--pantaloon's
tricks must yield to more egregious folly.  to see a mortal adorn
an object with imaginary charms, and then fall down and [[worship]] the
idol which he had himself set up--how ridiculous!  but what serious
consequences ensue to rob [[man]] of that portion of [[happiness]], which
the deity by calling him into existence has (or, on what can his
attributes rest?) indubitably promised; would not all the purposes
of [[life]] have been much [[better]] fulfilled if he had only [[felt]] what
has been termed physical [[love]]?  and, would not the sight of the
object, not seen through the medium of the [[imagination]], soon reduce
the passion to an appetite, if reflection, the [[noble]] distinction of
man, did not give it [[force]], and make it an instrument to raise him
above this earthy dross, by teaching him to [[love]] the centre of all
perfection! whose [[wisdom]] appears clearer and clearer in the works
of [[nature]], in proportion as [[reason]] is illuminated and exalted by
contemplation, and by acquiring that [[love]] of order which the
struggles of passion [[produce]]?

the habit of reflection, and the [[knowledge]] attained by fostering
any passion, might be shown to be equally useful though the object
be proved equally fallacious; for they would all appear in the same
light, if they were not magnified by the governing passion
implanted in us by the author of all [[good]], to call forth and
strengthen the faculties of each [[individual]], and enable it to
attain all the [[experience]] that an infant can obtain, who does
certain things, it cannot tell why.

i descend from my height, and mixing with my fellow creatures, feel
myself hurried along the [[common]] stream; [[ambition]], [[love]], [[hope]], and
fear, exert their wonted [[power]], though we be convinced by reason
that their [[present]] and most attractive promises are only lying
dreams; but had the cold hand of circumspection damped each
generous feeling before it had left any permanent [[character]], or
fixed some habit, what could be expected, but selfish prudence and
reason just rising above instinct?  who that has [[read]] dean swift's
disgusting description of the yahoos, and insipid one of houyhnhnm
with a philosophical eye, can avoid seeing the futility of
degrading the [[passions]], or making [[man]] rest in contentment?

the [[youth]] should act; for had he the [[experience]] of a grey head, he
would be fitter for [[death]] than [[life]], though his virtues [[virtue]], rather
residing in his head than his [[heart]] could [[produce]] nothing [[great]],
and his understanding prepared for this [[world]], would not, by its
noble flights, prove that it had a title to a [[better]].

besides, it is not possible to give a [[young]] [[person]] a just view of
life; he must have struggled with his own [[passions]] before he can
estimate the [[force]] of the temptation which betrayed his brother
into [[vice]].  those who are entering [[life]], and those who are
departing, see the [[world]] from such very different points of view,
that they can seldom [[think]] alike, unless the unfledged [[reason]] of
the former never attempted a solitary flight.

when we hear of some daring crime--it comes full upon us in the
deepest shade of turpitude, and raises indignation; but the eye
that gradually saw the darkness thicken, must observe it with more
compassionate forbearance.  the [[world]] cannot be seen by an unmoved
spectator, we must mix in the throng, and [[feel]] as [[men]] [[feel]] before
we can [[judge]] of their feelings.  if we mean, in short, to [[live]] in
the [[world]] to grow wiser and [[better]], and not merely to enjoy the
good things of [[life]], we must attain a [[knowledge]] of others at the
same [[time]] that we become acquainted with ourselves-- knowledge
acquired any other way only hardens the [[heart]] and perplexes the
understanding.

i may be told, that the [[knowledge]] thus acquired, is sometimes
purchased at too dear a rate.  i can only [[answer]], that i very much
doubt whether any [[knowledge]] can be attained without [[labour]] and
sorrow; and those who [[wish]] to spare their [[children]] both, should not
complain if they are neither [[wise]] nor [[virtuous]].  they only aimed at
making them prudent; and prudence, early in [[life]], is but the
cautious craft of ignorant self-love.  i have observed, that young
people, to whose [[education]] particular attention has been paid,
have, in general, been very superficial and conceited, and far from
pleasing in any [[respect]], because they had neither the unsuspecting
warmth of [[youth]], nor the cool depth of [[age]].  i cannot [[help]] imputing
this unnatural appearance principally to that hasty premature
instruction, which leads them presumptuously to repeat all the
crude notions they have taken upon trust, so that the careful
education which they received, makes them all their lives [[life]] the
slaves of prejudices.

mental as well as bodily exertion is, at first, irksome; so much
so, that the many would fain let others both [[work]] and [[think]] for
them.  an observation which i have often made will illustrate my
meaning.  when in a circle of strangers, or acquaintances, a person
of moderate abilities, asserts an [[opinion]] with heat, i will venture
to affirm, for i have traced this [[fact]] [[home]], very often, that it is
a prejudice.  these echoes have a high [[respect]] for the
understanding of some relation or friend, and without fully
comprehending the opinions [[opinion]], which they are so eager to retail, they
maintain them with a [[degree]] of obstinacy, that would surprise even
the [[person]] who concocted them.

i [[know]] that a [[kind]] of [[fashion]] now prevails of respecting
prejudices; and when any one dares to face them, though actuated by
humanity and armed by [[reason]], he is superciliously [[asked]], whether
his [[ancestors]] were fools [[fool]].  no, i should reply; opinions [[opinion]], at first,
of every description, were all, probably, considered, and therefore
were founded on some [[reason]]; yet not unfrequently, of course, it
was rather a local expedient than a fundamental [[principle]], that
would be reasonable at all times [[time]].  but, moss-covered opinions
assume the disproportioned form of prejudices, when they are
indolently adopted only because [[age]] has given them a venerable
aspect, though the [[reason]] on which they were built ceases to be a
reason, or cannot be traced.  why are we to [[love]] prejudices, merely
because they are prejudices?  a prejudice is a fond obstinate
persuasion, for which we can give no [[reason]]; for the moment a
reason can be given for an [[opinion]], it ceases to be a prejudice,
though it may be an error in [[judgment]]:  and are we then advised to
cherish opinions [[opinion]] only to set [[reason]] at defiance?  this mode of
arguing, if arguing it may be called, reminds me of what is
vulgarly termed a woman's [[reason]].  for [[women]] sometimes declare that
they [[love]], or [[believe]] [[certain]] things, because they [[love]], or believe
them.

it is impossible to converse with [[people]] to any [[purpose]], who, in
this style, only use affirmatives and negatives.  before you can
bring them to a point, to start fairly from, you must go back to
the simple principles [[principle]] that were antecedent to the prejudices
broached by [[power]]; and it is ten to one but you are stopped by the
philosophical assertion, that [[certain]] principles [[principle]] are as practically
false as they are abstractly true.  nay, it may be inferred, that
reason has whispered some doubts [[doubt]], for it generally happens that
people assert their opinions [[opinion]] with the [[greatest]] heat when they begin
to waver; striving to drive out their own doubts [[doubt]] by convincing
their opponent, they grow angry when those gnawing doubts [[doubt]] are
thrown back to prey on themselves.

the [[fact]] is, that [[men]] expect from [[education]], what [[education]] cannot
give.  a sagacious parent or tutor may strengthen the [[body]] and
sharpen the instruments by which the child is to gather [[knowledge]];
but the honey must be the [[reward]] of the individual's own industry.
it is almost as absurd to attempt to make a [[youth]] [[wise]] by the
experience of another, as to expect the [[body]] to grow [[strong]] by the
exercise which is only talked of, or seen.

many of those [[children]] whose conduct has been most narrowly
watched, become the weakest [[men]], because their instructors only
instill [[certain]] notions into their minds [[mind]], that have no other
foundation than their [[authority]]; and if they are loved or
respected, the [[mind]] is cramped in its exertions and wavering in its
advances.  the [[business]] of [[education]] in this case, is only to
conduct the shooting tendrils to a proper pole; yet after laying
precept upon precept, without allowing a child to acquire judgment
itself, parents expect them to act in the same manner by this
borrowed fallacious [[light]], as if they had illuminated it
themselves; and be, when they enter [[life]], what their parents are at
the close.  they do not consider that the tree, and even the human
body, does not strengthen its fibres till it has reached its full
growth.

there appears to be something analogous in the [[mind]].  the senses
and the [[imagination]] give a form to the [[character]], during childhood
and [[youth]]; and the understanding as [[life]] advances, gives firmness
to the first [[fair]] purposes [[purpose]] of sensibility--till [[virtue]], arising
rather from the clear conviction of [[reason]] than the impulse of the
heart, morality is made to rest on a rock against which the storms
of passion vainly beat.

i [[hope]] i shall not be misunderstood when i say, that [[religion]] will
not have this condensing energy, unless it be founded on [[reason]].
if it be merely the refuge of weakness or wild fanaticism, and not
a governing [[principle]] of conduct, drawn from self-knowledge, and a
rational [[opinion]] respecting the attributes of [[god]], what can it be
expected to [[produce]]?  the [[religion]] which consists in warming the
affections, and exalting the [[imagination]], is only the poetical
part, and may afford the [[individual]] [[pleasure]] without rendering it a
more [[moral]] being.  it may be a substitute for worldly pursuits; yet
narrow instead of enlarging the [[heart]]:  but [[virtue]] must be loved as
in itself sublime and excellent, and not for the advantages it
procures or the evils [[evil]] it averts, if any [[great]] [[degree]] of excellence
be expected.  [[men]] will not become [[moral]] when they only build airy
castles in a future [[world]] to compensate for the disappointments
which they meet with in this; if they turn their thoughts [[thought]] from
relative duties [[duty]] to [[religious]] reveries.

most prospects in [[life]] are marred by the shuffling worldly wisdom
of [[men]], who, forgetting that they cannot serve [[god]] and mammon,
endeavour to blend contradictory things.  if you [[wish]] to make your
son [[rich]], pursue one course --if you are only anxious to make him
virtuous, you must take another; but do not imagine that you can
bound from one road to the other without losing your way.*

barbauld, in miscellaneous pieces in prose.)


chapter 6.

the effect which an early association of ideas [[idea]] has upon the
character.

educated in the enervating style recommended by the writers on whom
i have been animadverting; and not having a [[chance]], from their
subordinate [[state]] in [[society]], to recover their lost ground, is it
surprising that [[women]] every where appear a defect in [[nature]]?  is it
surprising, when we consider what a determinate effect an early
association of ideas [[idea]] has on the [[character]], that they neglect their
understandings, and turn all their attention to their persons [[person]]?

the [[great]] advantages which naturally result from storing the mind
with [[knowledge]], are obvious from the following considerations.  the
association of our ideas [[idea]] is either habitual or instantaneous; and
the latter mode seems rather to depend on the original temperature
of the [[mind]] than on the will.  when the ideas [[idea]], and matters of [[fact]],
are once taken in, they [[lie]] by for use, till some fortuitous
circumstance makes the information dart into the [[mind]] with
illustrative [[force]], that has been received at very different
periods of our lives [[life]].  like the lightning's flash are many
recollections; one [[idea]] assimilating and explaining another, with
astonishing rapidity.  i do not now allude to that quick perception
of [[truth]], which is so intuitive that it baffles research, and makes
us at a loss to determine whether it is reminiscence or
ratiocination, lost sight of in its celerity, that opens the dark
cloud.  over those instantaneous associations we have little [[power]];
for when the [[mind]] is once enlarged by excursive flights, or
profound reflection, the raw materials, will, in some [[degree]],
arrange themselves.  the understanding, it is true, may keep us
from going out of drawing when we group our thoughts [[thought]], or transcribe
from the [[imagination]] the warm sketches of fancy; but the animal
spirits, the [[individual]] [[character]] give the colouring.  over this
subtile electric fluid,* how little [[power]] do we possess, and over
it how little [[power]] can [[reason]] obtain!  these fine intractable
spirits appear to be the essence of genius, and beaming in its
eagle eye, [[produce]] in the most eminent [[degree]] the [[happy]] energy of
associating thoughts [[thought]] that surprise, delight, and instruct.  these
are the glowing minds [[mind]] that concentrate pictures for their
fellow-creatures; forcing them to view with interest the objects
reflected from the impassioned [[imagination]], which they passed over
in [[nature]].

(*footnote.  i have sometimes, when inclined to laugh at
materialists, [[asked]] whether, as the most powerful effects in nature
are apparently produced by fluids, the magnetic, etc. the passions
might not be fine volatile fluids that embraced [[humanity]], keeping
the more refractory elementary parts together--or whether they were
simply a liquid [[fire]] that pervaded the more sluggish materials
giving them [[life]] and heat?)

i must be allowed to explain myself.  the generality of people
cannot see or [[feel]] poetically, they want fancy, and therefore fly
from solitude in search of sensible objects; but when an author
lends them his [[eyes]], they can see as he saw, and be amused by
images they could not select, though lying before them.

education thus only supplies the [[man]] of genius with [[knowledge]] to
give variety and contrast to his associations; but there is an
habitual association of ideas [[idea]], that grows "with our [[growth]]," which
has a [[great]] effect on the [[moral]] [[character]] of [[mankind]]; and by which
a turn is given to the [[mind]], that commonly remains throughout [[life]].
so ductile is the understanding, and yet so stubborn, that the
associations which depend on adventitious circumstances, during the
period that the [[body]] takes to arrive at maturity, can seldom be
disentangled by [[reason]].  one [[idea]] calls up another, its old
associate, and memory, faithful to the first impressions,
particularly when the intellectual powers [[power]] are not employed to cool
our sensations, retraces them with mechanical exactness.

this habitual [[slavery]], to first impressions, has a more baneful
effect on the female than the male [[character]], because [[business]] and
other dry employments of the understanding, tend to deaden the
feelings and break associations that do [[violence]] to [[reason]].  but
females, who are made [[women]] of when they are mere [[children]], and
brought back to [[childhood]] when they ought to leave the go-cart
forever, have not sufficient [[strength]] of [[mind]] to efface the
superinductions of art [[arts]] that have smothered [[nature]].

every thing that they see or hear serves to fix impressions, call
forth emotions, and associate ideas [[idea]], that give a [[sexual]] character
to the [[mind]].  false notions of [[beauty]] and delicacy stop the growth
of their limbs and [[produce]] a sickly soreness, rather than delicacy
of organs; and thus weakened by being employed in unfolding instead
of examining the first associations, forced on them by every
surrounding object, how can they attain the vigour necessary to
enable them to throw off their factitious [[character]]?--where find
strength to recur to [[reason]] and rise superior to a [[system]] of
oppression, that blasts the [[fair]] promises of spring?  this cruel
association of ideas [[idea]], which every thing conspires to twist into all
their habits of thinking, or, to speak with more precision, of
feeling, receives new [[force]] when they begin to act a little for
themselves; for they then perceive, that it is only through their
address to excite emotions in [[men]], that [[pleasure]] and [[power]] are to
be obtained.  besides, all the books [[book]] professedly written for their
instruction, which make the first impression on their minds [[mind]], all
inculcate the same opinions [[opinion]].  educated in worse than egyptian
bondage, it is unreasonable, as well as cruel, to upbraid them with
faults that can scarcely be avoided, unless a [[degree]] of native
vigour be supposed, that falls to the lot of very few amongst
mankind.

for instance, the severest sarcasms have been levelled against the
sex, and they have been ridiculed for repeating "a set of phrases
learnt by rote," when nothing could be more [[natural]], considering
the [[education]] they receive, and that their "highest [[praise]] is to
obey, unargued"--the will of [[man]].  if they are not allowed to have
reason sufficient to govern their own conduct--why, all they
learn--must be learned by rote!  and when all their ingenuity is
called forth to adjust their dress, "a passion for a scarlet coat,"
is so [[natural]], that it never surprised me; and, allowing pope's
summary of their [[character]] to be just, "that every woman is at
heart a rake," why should they be bitterly censured for seeking a
congenial [[mind]], and preferring a rake to a [[man]] of sense?

rakes [[know]] how to [[work]] on their sensibility, whilst the modest
merit of reasonable [[men]] has, of course, less effect on their
feelings, and they cannot reach the [[heart]] by the way of the
understanding, because they have few sentiments in [[common]].

it seems a little absurd to expect [[women]] to be more reasonable than
men in their likings, and still to deny them the uncontroled use of
reason.  when do [[men]] fall in [[love]] with sense?  when do they, with
their superior powers [[power]] and advantages, turn from the [[person]] to the
mind?  and how can they then expect [[women]], who are only taught to
observe behaviour, and acquire manners rather than morals [[moral]], to
despise what they have been all their lives [[life]] labouring to attain?
where are they suddenly to find [[judgment]] enough to weigh patiently
the sense of an awkward [[virtuous]] [[man]], when his manners, of which
they are made critical judges [[judge]], are rebuffing, and his conversation
cold and dull, because it does not consist of pretty repartees, or
well-turned compliments?  in order to [[admire]] or esteem any thing
for a continuance, we must, at least, have our curiosity excited by
knowing, in some [[degree]], what we [[admire]]; for we are unable to
estimate the value of qualities and virtues [[virtue]] above our
comprehension.  such a [[respect]], when it is [[felt]], may be very
sublime; and the confused [[consciousness]] of [[humility]] may render the
dependent creature an interesting object, in some points of view;
but [[human]] [[love]] must have grosser ingredients; and the [[person]] very
naturally will come in for its share--and, an ample share it mostly
has!

love is, in a [[great]] [[degree]], an arbitrary passion, and will reign
like some other stalking mischiefs, by its own [[authority]], without
deigning to [[reason]]; and it may also be easily distinguished from
esteem, the foundation of [[friendship]], because it is often excited
by evanescent beauties [[beauty]] and graces, though to give an energy to the
sentiment something more solid must deepen their impression and set
the [[imagination]] to [[work]], to make the most fair-- the first [[good]].

common [[passions]] are excited by [[common]] qualities.  [[men]] look for
beauty and the simper of [[good]] humoured docility:  [[women]] are
captivated by easy manners: a gentleman-like [[man]] seldom fails to
please them, and their thirsty ears eagerly drink the insinuating
nothings of politeness, whilst they turn from the unintelligible
sounds of the charmer--reason, charm he never so wisely.  with
respect to superficial accomplishments, the rake certainly has the
advantage; and of these, females can form an [[opinion]], for it is
their own ground.  rendered [[gay]] and giddy by the whole tenor of
their lives [[life]], the very aspect of [[wisdom]], or the severe graces of
virtue must have a lugubrious appearance to them; and [[produce]] a
kind of restraint from which they and [[love]], sportive child,
naturally revolt.  without taste, excepting of the lighter [[kind]],
for taste is the offspring of [[judgment]], how can they discover, that
true [[beauty]] and grace must arise from the play of the [[mind]]? and how
can they be expected to relish in a lover what they do not, or very
imperfectly, possess themselves?  the sympathy that unites hearts [[heart]],
and invites to confidence, in them is so very faint, that it cannot
take [[fire]], and thus mount to passion.  no, i repeat it, the love
cherished by such minds [[mind]], must have grosser fuel!

the inference is obvious; till [[women]] are [[led]] to exercise their
understandings, they should not be satirized for their attachment
to rakes; nor even for being rakes at [[heart]], when it appears to be
the inevitable consequence of their [[education]].  they who [[live]] to
please must find their enjoyments, their [[happiness]], in pleasure!
it is a trite, yet true remark, that we never do any thing well,
unless we [[love]] it for its own sake.

supposing, however, for a moment, that [[women]] were, in some future
revolution of [[time]], to become, what i sincerely [[wish]] them to be,
even [[love]] would acquire more serious [[dignity]], and be purified in
its own fires [[fire]]; and [[virtue]] giving true delicacy to their affections,
they would turn with disgust from a rake.  reasoning then, as well
as feeling, the only province of woman, at [[present]], they might
easily guard against exterior graces, and quickly learn to despise
the sensibility that had been excited and hackneyed in the ways of
women, whose [[trade]] was [[vice]]; and allurement's wanton airs.  they
would recollect that the flame, (one must use appropriate
expressions,) which they wished to [[light]] up, had been exhausted by
lust, and that the sated appetite, losing all relish for pure and
simple pleasures [[pleasure]], could only be roused by licentious [[arts]] of
variety.  what satisfaction could a woman of delicacy promise
herself in a union with such a [[man]], when the very artlessness of
her affection might appear insipid?  thus does dryden describe the
situation:

"where [[love]] is [[duty]] on the female side,
on theirs mere sensual gust, and sought with surly [[pride]]."

but one grand [[truth]] [[women]] have yet to learn, though much it imports
them to act accordingly.  in the [[choice]] of a husband they should
not be [[led]] astray by the qualities of a lover--for a lover the
husband, even supposing him to be [[wise]] and [[virtuous]], cannot long
remain.

were [[women]] more rationally educated, could they take a more
comprehensive view of things, they would be contented to [[love]] but
once in their lives [[life]]; and after [[marriage]] calmly let passion subside
into friendship--into that tender intimacy, which is the best
refuge from [[care]]; yet is built on such pure, still affections, that
idle jealousies would not be allowed to disturb the discharge of
the sober duties [[duty]] of [[life]], nor to engross the thoughts [[thought]] that ought to
be otherwise employed.  this is a [[state]] in which many [[men]] [[live]]; but
few, very few [[women]].  and the difference may easily be accounted
for, without recurring to a [[sexual]] [[character]].  [[men]], for whom we are
told [[women]] are made, have too much occupied the thoughts [[thought]] of [[women]];
and this association has so entangled [[love]], with all their motives
of action; and, to harp a little on an old string, having been
solely employed either to prepare themselves to excite [[love]], or
actually putting their lessons in practice, they cannot live
without [[love]].  but, when a sense of [[duty]], or [[fear]] of shame, obliges
them to restrain this pampered [[desire]] of pleasing beyond certain
lengths, too far for delicacy, it is true, though far from
criminality, they obstinately determine to [[love]], i speak of their
passion, their husbands to the end of the chapter--and then acting
the part which they foolishly exacted from their lovers, they
become abject wooers, and fond slaves [[slave]].

men of wit and fancy are often rakes; and fancy is the food of
love.  such [[men]] will inspire passion.  half the [[sex]], in its present
infantine [[state]], would pine for a lovelace; a [[man]] so witty, so
graceful, and so valiant; and can they deserve blame for acting
according to principles [[principle]] so constantly inculcated?  they want a
lover and protector: and behold him kneeling before them--bravery
prostrate to beauty!  the virtues [[virtue]] of a husband are thus thrown by
love into the background, and [[gay]] hopes [[hope]], or lively emotions, banish
reflection till the day of reckoning comes; and come it surely
will, to turn the sprightly lover into a surly suspicious [[tyrant]],
who contemptuously insults the very weakness he fostered.  or,
supposing the rake reformed, he cannot quickly get rid of old
habits.  when a [[man]] of abilities is first carried away by his
passions, it is necessary that sentiment and taste varnish the
enormities of [[vice]], and give a zest to brutal indulgences: but when
the gloss of novelty is worn off, and [[pleasure]] palls upon the
sense, lasciviousness becomes barefaced, and enjoyment only the
desperate effort of weakness flying from reflection as from a
legion of devils [[devil]].  oh! [[virtue]], thou art [[arts]] not an empty name!  all
that [[life]] can give-- thou givest!

if much comfort cannot be expected from the [[friendship]] of a
reformed rake of superior abilities, what is the consequence when
he lacketh sense, as well as principles [[principle]]?  verily misery in its most
hideous shape.  when the habits of [[weak]] [[people]] are consolidated by
time, a reformation is barely possible; and actually makes the
beings miserable who have not sufficient [[mind]] to be amused by
innocent [[pleasure]]; like the tradesman who retires from the hurry of
business, [[nature]] presents [[present]] to them only a universal blank; and the
restless thoughts [[thought]] prey on the damped spirits.  their reformation as
well as his retirement actually makes them wretched, because it
deprives them of all employment, by quenching the hopes [[hope]] and fears
that set in motion their sluggish minds [[mind]].

if such be the [[force]] of habit; if such be the bondage of folly, how
carefully ought we to guard the [[mind]] from storing up vicious
associations; and equally careful should we be to cultivate the
understanding, to save the [[poor]] wight from the [[weak]] dependent state
of even harmless ignorance.  for it is the [[right]] use of reason
alone which makes us independent of every thing--excepting the
unclouded reason--"whose service is [[perfect]] [[freedom]]."


chapter 7.

modesty comprehensively considered and not as a [[sexual]] [[virtue]].

modesty!  [[sacred]] offspring of sensibility and reason! true delicacy
of mind! may i unblamed presume to investigate thy [[nature]], and
trace to its covert the mild charm, that mellowing each harsh
feature of a [[character]], renders what would otherwise only inspire
cold admiration--lovely!  thou that smoothest the wrinkles of
wisdom, and softenest the tone of the more sublime virtues [[virtue]] till
they all melt into humanity! thou that spreadest the ethereal cloud
that surrounding [[love]] heightens every [[beauty]], it half shades,
breathing those coy sweets that steal into the [[heart]], and charm the
senses--modulate for me the [[language]] of persuasive [[reason]], till i
rouse my [[sex]] from the flowery bed, on which they supinely sleep
life away!

in speaking of the association of our ideas [[idea]], i have noticed two
distinct modes; and in defining modesty, it appears to me equally
proper to discriminate that purity of [[mind]], which is the effect of
chastity, from a simplicity of [[character]] that leads us to form a
just [[opinion]] of ourselves, equally distant from vanity or
presumption, though by no means incompatible with a lofty
consciousness of our own [[dignity]].  modesty in the latter
signification of the term, is that soberness of [[mind]] which teaches
a [[man]] not to [[think]] more highly of himself than he ought to [[think]],
and should be distinguished from [[humility]], because [[humility]] is a
kind of self-abasement.  a modest [[man]] often conceives a [[great]] plan,
and tenaciously adheres to it, conscious of his own [[strength]], till
success gives it a sanction that determines its [[character]].  milton
was not arrogant when he [[suffered]] a suggestion of [[judgment]] to
escape him that proved a [[prophesy]]; nor was general washington when
he accepted of the command of the american forces [[force]].  the latter has
always been characterized as a modest [[man]]; but had he been merely
humble, he would probably have shrunk back irresolute, afraid of
trusting to himself the direction of an enterprise on which so much
depended.

a modest [[man]] is steady, an humble [[man]] timid, and a [[vain]] one
presumptuous; this is the [[judgment]], which the observation of many
characters, has [[led]] me to form.  [[jesus]] [[christ]] was modest, [[moses]] was
humble, and peter [[vain]].

thus discriminating modesty from [[humility]] in one case, i do not
mean to confound it with bashfulness in the other.  bashfulness, in
fact, is so distinct from modesty, that the most bashful lass, or
raw [[country]] lout, often becomes the most impudent; for their
bashfulness being merely the instinctive timidity of ignorance,
custom soon changes [[change]] it into assurance.*

(*footnote.  "such is the country-maiden's fright,
when first a red-coat is in sight;
behind the door she hides her face,
next [[time]] at distance [[eyes]] the lace:
she now can all his terrors stand,
nor from his squeeze withdraws her hand,
she plays familiar in his arms,
and every soldier hath his charms;
>from tent to tent she spreads her flame;
for custom conquers [[fear]] and shame.")

the shameless behaviour of the prostitutes who infest the streets
of [[london]], raising alternate emotions of [[pity]] and disgust, may
serve to illustrate this remark.  they trample on virgin
bashfulness with a sort of bravado, and glorying in their shame,
become more audaciously lewd than [[men]], however depraved, to whom
the [[sexual]] quality has not been gratuitously granted, ever appear
to be.  but these [[poor]] ignorant wretches never had any modesty to
lose, when they consigned themselves to infamy; for modesty is a
virtue not a quality.  no, they were only bashful, shame-faced
innocents; and losing their innocence, their shame-facedness was
rudely brushed off; a [[virtue]] would have left some vestiges in the
mind, had it been sacrificed to passion, to make us [[respect]] the
grand ruin.

purity of [[mind]], or that [[genuine]] delicacy, which is the only
virtuous support of chastity, is near a-kin to that refinement of
humanity, which never resides in any but cultivated minds [[mind]].  it is
something nobler than innocence; it is the delicacy of reflection,
and not the coyness of ignorance.  the reserve of [[reason]], which
like habitual cleanliness, is seldom seen in any [[great]] [[degree]],
unless the [[soul]] is active, may easily be distinguished from rustic
shyness or wanton skittishness; and so far from being incompatible
with [[knowledge]], it is its fairest fruit.  what a gross [[idea]] of
modesty had the writer of the following remark!  "the [[lady]] who
asked the [[question]] whether [[women]] may be instructed in the modern
system of botany, consistently with female delicacy?" was accused
of ridiculous prudery:  nevertheless, if she had proposed the
question to me, i should certainly have answered--they cannot."
thus is the [[fair]] [[book]] of [[knowledge]] to be shut with an everlasting
seal!  on reading similar passages i have reverentially lifted up
my [[eyes]] and [[heart]] to him who liveth for ever and ever, and said, o
my [[father]], hast thou by the very [[constitution]] of her [[nature]] forbid
thy child to seek thee in the [[fair]] forms of [[truth]]?  and, can her
soul be sullied by the [[knowledge]] that awfully calls her to thee?

i have then philosophically pursued these reflections till i
inferred, that those [[women]] who have most improved their [[reason]] must
have the most modesty --though a dignified sedateness of deportment
may have succeeded the playful, bewitching bashfulness of [[youth]].*

(*footnote.  modesty, is the graceful calm [[virtue]] of maturity;
bashfulness, the charm of vivacious [[youth]].)

and thus have i argued.  to render chastity the [[virtue]] from which
unsophisticated modesty will naturally flow, the attention should
be called away from employments, which only exercise the
sensibility; and the [[heart]] made to beat [[time]] to [[humanity]], rather
than to throb with [[love]].  the woman who has dedicated a
considerable portion of her [[time]] to pursuits purely intellectual,
and whose affections have been exercised by humane plans of
usefulness, must have more purity of [[mind]], as a natural
consequence, than the ignorant beings whose [[time]] and thoughts [[thought]] have
been occupied by [[gay]] pleasures [[pleasure]] or schemes to conquer hearts [[heart]].  the
regulation of the behaviour is not modesty, though those who study
rules of decorum, are, in general termed modest [[women]].  make the
heart clean, let it expand and [[feel]] for all that is [[human]], instead
of being narrowed by selfish [[passions]]; and let the [[mind]] frequently
contemplate subjects [[subject]] that exercise the understanding, without
heating the [[imagination]], and artless modesty will give the
finishing touches to the picture.

she who can discern the dawn of immortality, in the streaks that
shoot athwart the misty night of ignorance, promising a clearer
day, will [[respect]], as a [[sacred]] temple, the [[body]] that enshrines such
an improvable [[soul]].  true [[love]], likewise, spreads this [[kind]] of
mysterious [[sanctity]] round the beloved object, making the lover most
modest when in her presence.  so reserved is affection, that,
receiving or returning personal endearments, it wishes [[wish]], not only to
shun the [[human]] eye, as a [[kind]] of profanation; but to diffuse an
encircling cloudy obscurity to shut out even the saucy sparkling
sunbeams.  yet, that affection does not deserve the epithet of
chaste which does not receive a sublime gloom of tender melancholy,
that allows the [[mind]] for a moment to stand still and enjoy the
present satisfaction, when a [[consciousness]] of the [[divine]] presence
is felt--for this must ever be the food of joy!

as i have always been fond of tracing to its source in [[nature]] any
prevailing custom, i have frequently [[thought]] that it was a
sentiment of affection for whatever had touched the [[person]] of an
absent or lost friend, which gave birth to that [[respect]] for relics,
so much abused by selfish priests [[priest]].  devotion, or [[love]], may be
allowed to hallow the garments as well as the [[person]]; for the lover
must want fancy, who has not a sort of [[sacred]] [[respect]] for the glove
or slipper of his mistress.  he could not confound them with vulgar
things of the same [[kind]].

this fine sentiment, perhaps, would not bear to be analyzed by the
experimental philosopher--but of such stuff is [[human]] rapture made
up!-- a shadowy phantom glides before us, obscuring every other
object; yet when the soft cloud is grasped, the form melts into
common air, leaving a solitary void, or sweet perfume, stolen from
the violet, that memory long holds dear.  but, i have tripped
unawares on fairy ground, feeling the balmy gale of spring stealing
on me, though november frowns.

as a [[sex]], [[women]] are more chaste than [[men]], and as modesty is the
effect of chastity, they may deserve to have this [[virtue]] ascribed
to them in rather an appropriated sense; yet, i must be allowed to
add an hesitating if:-- for i [[doubt]], whether chastity will produce
modesty, though it may propriety of conduct, when it is merely a
respect for the [[opinion]] of the [[world]], and when coquetry and the
lovelorn tales of novelists employ the thoughts [[thought]].  nay, from
experience, and [[reason]], i should be lead to expect to meet with
more modesty amongst [[men]] than [[women]], simply because [[men]] exercise
their understandings more than [[women]].

but, with [[respect]] to propriety of behaviour, excepting one class of
females, [[women]] have evidently the advantage.  what can be more
disgusting than that impudent dross of gallantry, [[thought]] so manly,
which makes many [[men]] stare insultingly at every female they meet?
is this [[respect]] for the [[sex]]?  this loose behaviour shows such
habitual depravity, such weakness of [[mind]], that it is [[vain]] to
expect much [[public]] or private [[virtue]], till both [[men]] and [[women]] grow
more modest--till [[men]], curbing a sensual fondness for the [[sex]], or
an affectation of manly assurance, more properly speaking,
impudence, treat each other with respect--unless appetite or
passion gives the tone, peculiar to it, to their behaviour.  i mean
even personal respect--the modest [[respect]] of [[humanity]], and
fellow-feeling; not the libidinous mockery of gallantry, nor the
insolent condescension of protectorship.

to carry the observation still further, modesty must heartily
disclaim, and refuse to dwell with that debauchery of [[mind]], which
leads a [[man]] coolly to bring forward, without a blush, indecent
allusions, or obscene witticisms, in the presence of a fellow
creature; [[women]] are now out of the [[question]], for then it is
brutality.  [[respect]] for [[man]], as [[man]] is the foundation of every
noble sentiment.  how much more modest is the libertine who obeys
the call of appetite or fancy, than the lewd joker who sets the
table in a roar.

this is one of the many instances in which the [[sexual]] distinction
respecting modesty has proved fatal to [[virtue]] and [[happiness]].  it
is, however, carried still further, and woman, [[weak]] woman! made by
her [[education]] the [[slave]] of sensibility, is required, on the most
trying occasions [[occasion]], to resist that sensibility.  "can any thing,"
says knox, be more absurd than keeping [[women]] in a [[state]] of
ignorance, and yet so vehemently to insist on their resisting
temptation?  thus when [[virtue]] or [[honour]] make it proper to check a
passion, the burden is thrown on the weaker shoulders, contrary to
reason and true modesty, which, at least, should render the
self-denial mutual, to say nothing of the generosity of bravery,
supposed to be a manly [[virtue]].

in the same strain runs rousseau's and dr. gregory's advice
respecting modesty, strangely miscalled! for they both [[desire]] a
wife to leave it in [[doubt]], whether sensibility or weakness [[led]] her
to her husband's arms.  the woman is immodest who can let the
shadow of such a [[doubt]] remain on her husband's [[mind]] a moment.

but to [[state]] the [[subject]] in a different [[light]].  the want of
modesty, which i principally deplore as subversive of morality,
arises from the [[state]] of warfare so strenuously supported by
voluptuous [[men]] as the very essence of modesty, though, in [[fact]], its
bane; because it is a refinement on sensual [[desire]], that [[men]] fall
into who have not sufficient [[virtue]] to relish the innocent
pleasures of [[love]].  a [[man]] of delicacy carries his notions of
modesty still further, for neither weakness nor sensibility will
gratify him--he looks for affection.

again; [[men]] boast of their triumphs over [[women]], what do they boast
of? truly the creature of sensibility was surprised by her
sensibility into folly--into [[vice]];* and the dreadful reckoning
falls heavily on her own [[weak]] head, when [[reason]] wakes.  for where
art thou to find comfort, forlorn and disconsolate one?  he who
ought to have directed thy [[reason]], and supported thy weakness, has
betrayed thee!  in a [[dream]] of passion thou consentedst to wander
through flowery lawns, and heedlessly stepping over the precipice
to which thy guide, instead of guarding, lured thee, thou startest
from thy [[dream]] only to face a sneering, frowning [[world]], and to find
thyself alone in a waste, for he that triumphed in thy weakness is
now pursuing new conquests; but for thee--there is no redemption on
this side the grave!  and what resource hast thou in an enervated
mind to raise a sinking [[heart]]?

(*footnote.  the [[poor]] moth fluttering round a candle, burns its
wings.)

but, if the sexes [[sex]] be really to [[live]] in a [[state]] of warfare, if
nature has pointed it out, let [[men]] act nobly, or let [[pride]] whisper
to them, that the [[victory]] is mean when they merely vanquish
sensibility.  the real [[conquest]] is that over affection not taken by
surprise--when, like heloisa, a woman gives up all the [[world]],
deliberately, for [[love]].  i do not now consider the [[wisdom]] or virtue
of such a [[sacrifice]], i only contend that it was a [[sacrifice]] to
affection, and not merely to sensibility, though she had her share.
and i must be allowed to call her a modest woman, before i dismiss
this part of the [[subject]], by saying, that till [[men]] are more chaste,
women will be immodest.  where, indeed, could modest [[women]] find
husbands from whom they would not continually turn with disgust?
modesty must be equally cultivated by both sexes [[sex]], or it will ever
remain a sickly hot-house plant, whilst the affectation of it, the
fig leaf borrowed by wantonness, may give a zest to voluptuous
enjoyments.)

men will probably still insist that woman ought to have more
modesty than [[man]]; but it is not dispassionate reasoners who will
most earnestly oppose my [[opinion]].  no, they are the [[men]] of fancy,
the favourites of the [[sex]], who outwardly [[respect]], and inwardly
despise the [[weak]] creatures whom they thus [[sport]] with.  they cannot
submit to resign the highest sensual gratification, nor even to
relish the epicurism of virtue--self-denial.

to take another view of the [[subject]], confining my remarks to [[women]].

the ridiculous falsities which are told to [[children]], from mistaken
notions of modesty, tend very early to inflame their imaginations
and set their little minds [[mind]] to [[work]], respecting subjects [[subject]], which
nature never intended they should [[think]] of, till the [[body]] arrived
at some [[degree]] of maturity; then the [[passions]] naturally begin to
take place of the senses, as instruments to unfold the
understanding, and form the [[moral]] [[character]].

in nurseries, and boarding schools, i [[fear]], girls are first
spoiled; particularly in the latter.  a number of girls sleep in
the same room, and wash together.  and, though i should be [[sorry]] to
contaminate an [[innocent]] creature's [[mind]] by instilling false
delicacy, or those indecent prudish notions, which early cautions
respecting the other [[sex]] naturally engender, i should be very
anxious to prevent their acquiring indelicate, or immodest habits;
and as many girls have learned very indelicate tricks, from
ignorant servants, the mixing them thus indiscriminately together,
is very improper.

to say the [[truth]], [[women]] are, in general, too familiar with each
other, which leads to that gross [[degree]] of familiarity that so
frequently renders the [[marriage]] [[state]] unhappy.  why in the name of
decency are sisters, female intimates, or ladies [[lady]] and their waiting
women, to be so grossly familiar as to forget the [[respect]] which one
human creature owes to another?  that squeamish delicacy which
shrinks from the most disgusting offices when affection or humanity
lead us to watch at a sick pillow, is despicable.  but, why women
in health should be more familiar with each other than [[men]] are,
when they boast of their superiour delicacy, is a solecism in
manners which i could never solve.

in order to preserve health and [[beauty]], i should earnestly
recommend frequent ablutions, to dignify my [[advice]] that it may not
offend the fastidious ear; and, by [[example]], girls ought to be
taught to wash and dress alone, without any distinction of rank;
and if custom should make them require some little assistance, let
them not require it till that part of the [[business]] is over which
ought never to be done before a fellow-creature; because it is an
insult to the majesty of [[human]] [[nature]].  not on the score of
modesty, but decency; for the [[care]] which some modest [[women]] take,
making at the same [[time]] a display of that [[care]], not to let their
legs be seen, is as childish as immodest.*

(*footnote.  i [[remember]] to have met with a sentence, in a [[book]] of
education that made me smile.  "it would be needless to caution you
against putting your hand, by [[chance]], under your neck-handkerchief;
for a modest woman never did so!")

i could proceed still further, till i animadverted on some still
more indelicate customs, which [[men]] never fall into.  secrets are
told--where [[silence]] ought to reign; and that regard to cleanliness,
which some [[religious]] sects have, perhaps, carried too far,
especially the essenes, amongst the [[jews]], by making that an insult
to [[god]] which is only an insult to [[humanity]], is violated in a brutal
manner.  how can delicate [[women]] obtrude on notice that part of the
animal economy, which is so very disgusting?  and is it not very
rational to conclude, that the [[women]] who have not been taught to
respect the [[human]] [[nature]] of their own [[sex]], in these particulars,
will not long [[respect]] the mere difference of [[sex]], in their
husbands?  after their maidenish bashfulness is once lost, i, in
fact, have generally observed, that [[women]] fall into old habits; and
treat their husbands as they did their sisters or female
acquaintance.

besides, [[women]] from necessity, because their minds [[mind]] are not
cultivated, have recourse very often, to what i familiarly term
bodily wit; and their intimacies are of the same [[kind]].  in short,
with [[respect]] to both [[mind]] and [[body]], they are too intimate.  that
decent personal reserve, which is the foundation of [[dignity]] of
character, must be kept up between [[women]], or their minds [[mind]] will never
gain [[strength]] or modesty.

on this account also, i object to many females being shut up
together in nurseries, schools, or convents.  i cannot recollect
without indignation, the jokes and hoiden tricks, which knots of
young [[women]] indulged themselves in, when in my [[youth]] accident threw
me, an awkward rustic, in their way.  they were almost on a par
with the double meanings, which shake the convivial table when the
glass has circulated freely.  but it is [[vain]] to attempt to keep the
heart pure, unless the head is furnished with ideas [[idea]], and set to
work to compare them, in order, to acquire [[judgment]], by
generalizing simple ones; and modesty by making the understanding
damp the sensibility.

it may be [[thought]] that i lay too [[great]] a stress on personal
reserve; but it is ever the hand-maid of modesty.  so that were i
to name the graces that ought to adorn [[beauty]], i should instantly
exclaim, cleanliness, neatness, and personal reserve.  it is
obvious, i suppose, that the reserve i mean, has nothing [[sexual]] in
it, and that i [[think]] it equally necessary in both sexes [[sex]].  so
necessary indeed, is that reserve and cleanliness which indolent
women too often neglect, that i will venture to affirm, that when
two or three [[women]] [[live]] in the same house, the one will be most
respected by the male part of the [[family]], who reside with them,
leaving [[love]] entirely out of the [[question]], who pays [[pay]] this [[kind]] of
habitual [[respect]] to her [[person]].

when domestic [[friends]] meet in a morning, there will naturally
prevail an affectionate seriousness, especially, if each look
forward to the discharge of daily duties [[duty]]; and it may be reckoned
fanciful, but this sentiment has frequently risen spontaneously in
my [[mind]].  i have been pleased after breathing the sweet bracing
morning air, to see the same [[kind]] of freshness in the countenances
i particularly loved; i was glad to see them braced, as it were,
for the day, and ready to run their course with the sun.  the
greetings of affection in the morning are by these means more
respectful, than the familiar tenderness which frequently prolongs
the evening talk.  nay, i have often [[felt]] hurt, not to say
disgusted, when a friend has appeared, whom i parted with full
dressed the evening before, with her clothes huddled on, because
she chose to indulge herself in bed till the [[last]] moment.

domestic affection can only be kept alive by these neglected
attentions; yet if [[men]] and [[women]] took half as much pains [[pain]] to dress
habitually neat, as they do to ornament, or rather to disfigure
their persons [[person]], much would be done towards the attainment of purity
of [[mind]].  but [[women]] only dress to gratify [[men]] of gallantry; for the
lover is always [[best]] pleased with the simple garb that sits close
to the shape.  there is an impertinence in ornaments that rebuffs
affection; because [[love]] always clings round the [[idea]] of [[home]].

as a [[sex]], [[women]] are habitually indolent; and every thing tends to
make them so.  i do not forget the starts of activity which
sensibility produces [[produce]]; but as these flights of feeling only increase
the [[evil]], they are not to be confounded with the slow, orderly walk
of [[reason]].  so [[great]], in reality, is their mental and bodily
indolence, that till their [[body]] be strengthened and their
understanding enlarged by active exertions, there is little reason
to expect that modesty will take place of bashfulness.  they may
find it prudent to assume its semblance; but the [[fair]] veil will
only be worn on gala days.

perhaps there is not a [[virtue]] that mixes so kindly with every other
as modesty.  it is the pale moon-beam that renders more interesting
every [[virtue]] it softens, giving mild grandeur to the contracted
horizon.  nothing can be more beautiful than the poetical fiction,
which makes diana with her silver crescent, the [[goddess]] of
chastity.  i have sometimes [[thought]], that wandering with sedate
step in some lonely recess, a modest dame of antiquity must have
felt a glow of conscious [[dignity]], when, after contemplating the
soft shadowy landscape, she has invited with placid fervour the
mild reflection of her sister's beams to turn to her chaste bosom.

a [[christian]] has still nobler motives to incite her to preserve her
chastity and acquire modesty, for her [[body]] has been called the
temple of the living [[god]]; of that [[god]] who requires more than
modesty of mien.  his eye searcheth the [[heart]]; and let her
remember, that if she hopeth to find favour in the sight of purity
itself, her chastity must be founded on modesty, and not on worldly
prudence; or verily a [[good]] [[reputation]] will be her only [[reward]]; for
that awful intercourse, that [[sacred]] communion, which virtue
establishes between [[man]] and his maker, must give rise to the wish
of being pure as he is pure!

after the foregoing remarks, it is almost superfluous to add, that
i consider all those feminine airs of maturity, which succeed
bashfulness, to which [[truth]] is sacrificed, to secure the [[heart]] of a
husband, or rather to [[force]] him to be still a lover when nature
would, had she not been interrupted in her operations, have made
love give place to [[friendship]], as immodest.  the tenderness which a
man will [[feel]] for the [[mother]] of his [[children]] is an excellent
substitute for the ardour of unsatisfied passion; but to prolong
that ardour it is indelicate, not to say immodest, for [[women]] to
feign an unnatural coldness of [[constitution]].  [[women]] as well as men
ought to have the [[common]] appetites and [[passions]] of their [[nature]],
they are only brutal when unchecked by [[reason]]:  but the obligation
to check them is the [[duty]] of [[mankind]], not a [[sexual]] [[duty]].  [[nature]],
in these respects [[respect]], may safely be left to herself; let [[women]] only
acquire [[knowledge]] and [[humanity]], and [[love]] will [[teach]] them modesty.
there is no need of falsehoods, disgusting as futile, for studied
rules of behaviour only impose on shallow observers; a [[man]] of sense
soon sees through, and despises the affectation.

the behaviour of [[young]] [[people]], to each other, as [[men]] and [[women]], is
the [[last]] thing that should be [[thought]] of in [[education]].  in [[fact]],
behaviour in most circumstances is now so much [[thought]] of, that
simplicity of [[character]] is rarely to be seen;  yet, if [[men]] were
only anxious to cultivate each [[virtue]], and let it take root firmly
in the [[mind]], the grace resulting from it, its [[natural]] exteriour
mark, would soon strip affectation of its flaunting plumes;
because, fallacious as unstable, is the conduct that is not founded
upon truth!

(footnote.  the behaviour of many newly [[married]] [[women]] has often
disgusted me.  they seem anxious never to let their husbands forget
the [[privilege]] of [[marriage]], and to find no [[pleasure]] in his society
unless he is acting the lover.  short, indeed, must be the reign of
love, when the flame is thus constantly blown up, without its
receiving any solid fuel.)

would ye, o my sisters, really possess modesty, ye must remember
that the possession of [[virtue]], of any denomination, is incompatible
with ignorance and vanity! ye must acquire that soberness of [[mind]],
which the exercise of duties [[duty]], and the pursuit of [[knowledge]], alone
inspire, or ye will still remain in a doubtful dependent situation,
and only be loved whilst ye are fair! the downcast eye, the rosy
blush, the retiring grace, are all proper in their season; but
modesty, being the child of [[reason]], cannot long [[exist]] with the
sensibility that is not tempered by reflection.  besides, when
love, even [[innocent]] [[love]], is the whole employ of your lives [[life]], your
hearts will be too soft to afford modesty that tranquil retreat,
where she delights to dwell, in close union with [[humanity]].


chapter 8.

morality undermined by [[sexual]] notions of the importance of a good
reputation.

it has long since occurred to me, that [[advice]] respecting behaviour,
and all the various modes of preserving a [[good]] [[reputation]], which
have been so strenuously inculcated on the female [[world]], were
specious poisons, that incrusting morality [[eat]] away the substance.
and, that this measuring of shadows produced a false calculation,
because their length depends so much on the height of the sun, and
other adventitious circumstances.

>from whence arises the easy fallacious behaviour of a courtier?
>from this situation, undoubtedly:  for standing in need of
dependents, he is obliged to learn the art [[arts]] of denying without
giving offence, and, of evasively feeding [[hope]] with the chameleon's
food;  thus does politeness [[sport]] with [[truth]], and eating away the
sincerity and [[humanity]] [[natural]] to [[man]], [[produce]] the fine gentleman.

women in the same way acquire, from a supposed necessity, an
equally artificial mode of behaviour.  yet [[truth]] is not with
impunity to be sported with, for the practised dissembler, at [[last]],
becomes the dupe of his own [[arts]], loses that sagacity which has
been justly termed [[common]] sense; namely, a quick perception of
common truths [[truth]]:  which are constantly received as such by the
unsophisticated [[mind]], though it might not have had sufficient
energy to discover them itself, when obscured by local prejudices.
the greater number of [[people]] take their opinions [[opinion]] on trust, to avoid
the trouble of exercising their own minds [[mind]], and these indolent
beings naturally adhere to the letter, rather than the spirit of a
law, [[divine]] or [[human]].  "women," says some author, i cannot
recollect who, "mind not what only [[heaven]] sees."  why, indeed
should they? it is the eye of [[man]] that they have been taught to
dread--and if they can lull their argus to sleep, they seldom think
of [[heaven]] or themselves, because their [[reputation]] is safe; and it
is [[reputation]] not chastity and all its [[fair]] train, that they are
employed to keep [[free]] from spot, not as a [[virtue]], but to preserve
their station in the [[world]].

to prove the [[truth]] of this remark, i need only advert to the
intrigues of [[married]] [[women]], particularly in high [[life]], and in
countries where [[women]] are suitably [[married]], according to their
respective ranks by their parents.  if an [[innocent]] girl become a
prey to [[love]], she is degraded forever, though her [[mind]] was not
polluted by the [[arts]] which [[married]] [[women]], under the convenient
cloak of [[marriage]], practise; nor has she violated any duty--but the
duty of respecting herself.  the [[married]] woman, on the contrary,
breaks a most [[sacred]] engagement, and becomes a cruel [[mother]] when
she is a false and faithless [[wife]].  if her husband has still an
affection for her, the [[arts]] which she must practise to [[deceive]] him,
will render her the most contemptible of [[human]] beings; and at any
rate, the contrivances necessary to preserve appearances, will keep
her [[mind]] in that childish or vicious tumult which destroys all its
energy.  besides, in [[time]], like those [[people]] who habitually take
cordials to raise their spirits, she will want an intrigue to give
life to her thoughts [[thought]], having lost all relish for pleasures [[pleasure]] that are
not highly seasoned by [[hope]] or [[fear]].

sometimes [[married]] [[women]] act still more audaciously; i will mention
an instance.

a woman of quality, notorious for her gallantries, though as she
still lived with her husband, nobody chose to place her in the
class where she ought to have been placed, made a point of treating
with the most insulting contempt a [[poor]] timid creature, abashed by
a sense of her former weakness, whom a neighbouring gentleman had
seduced and afterwards [[married]].  this woman had actually confounded
virtue with [[reputation]]; and, i do [[believe]], valued herself on the
propriety of her behaviour before [[marriage]], though when once
settled, to the satisfaction of her [[family]], she and her [[lord]] were
equally faithless--so that the half alive heir to an immense estate
came from [[heaven]] knows [[know]] where!

to view this [[subject]] in another [[light]].

i have known a number of [[women]] who, if they did not [[love]] their
husbands, loved nobody else, giving themselves entirely up to
vanity and dissipation, neglecting every domestic [[duty]]; nay, even
squandering away all the [[money]] which should have been saved for
their helpless younger [[children]], yet have plumed themselves on
their unsullied [[reputation]], as if the whole compass of their duty
as wives [[wife]] and mothers [[mother]] was only to preserve it.  whilst other
indolent [[women]], neglecting every personal [[duty]], have [[thought]] that
they deserved their husband's affection, because they acted in this
respect with propriety.

weak minds [[mind]] are always fond of resting in the ceremonials of [[duty]],
but morality offers much simpler motives; and it were to be wished
that superficial moralists had said less respecting behaviour, and
outward observances, for unless [[virtue]], of any [[kind]], is built on
knowledge, it will only [[produce]] a [[kind]] of insipid decency.  respect
for the [[opinion]] of the [[world]], has, however, been termed the
principal [[duty]] of woman in the most express words, for rousseau
declares, "that [[reputation]] is no less indispensable than chastity."
"a [[man]]," adds he, "secure in his own [[good]] conduct, depends only on
himself, and may brave the [[public]] [[opinion]]; but a woman, in behaving
well, performs but half her [[duty]]; as what is [[thought]] of her, is as
important to her as what she really is.  it follows hence, that the
system of a woman's [[education]] should, in this [[respect]], be directly
contrary to that of ours.  [[opinion]] is the grave of [[virtue]] among the
men; but its [[throne]] among [[women]]."  it is strictly logical to infer,
that the [[virtue]] that rests on [[opinion]] is merely worldly, and that
it is the [[virtue]] of a being to whom [[reason]] has been denied.  but,
even with [[respect]] to the [[opinion]] of the [[world]], i am convinced, that
this class of reasoners are mistaken.

this regard for [[reputation]], independent of its being one of the
natural rewards [[reward]] of [[virtue]], however, took its rise from a cause that
i have already deplored as the grand source of female depravity,
the impossibility of regaining respectability by a return to
virtue, though [[men]] preserve theirs during the indulgence of [[vice]].
it was [[natural]] for [[women]] then to endeavour to preserve what once
lost--was lost for ever, till this [[care]] swallowing up every other
care, [[reputation]] for chastity, became the one thing needful to the
sex.  but [[vain]] is the scrupulosity of ignorance, for neither
religion nor [[virtue]], when they reside in the [[heart]], require such a
puerile attention to mere ceremonies [[ceremony]], because the behaviour must,
upon the whole be proper, when the motive is pure.

to support my [[opinion]] i can [[produce]] very respectable [[authority]]; and
the [[authority]] of a cool reasoner ought to have weight to enforce
consideration, though not to establish a sentiment.  speaking of
the general laws [[law]] of morality, dr. smith observes--"that by some
very extraordinary and unlucky circumstance, a [[good]] [[man]] may come to
be suspected of a crime of which he was altogether incapable, and
upon that account be most unjustly exposed for the remaining part
of his [[life]] to the [[horror]] and aversion of [[mankind]].  by an accident
of this [[kind]] he may be said to lose his all, notwithstanding his
integrity and [[justice]], in the same manner as a cautious [[man]],
notwithstanding his utmost circumspection, may be ruined by an
earthquake or an inundation.  accidents of the first [[kind]], however,
are perhaps still more rare, and still more contrary to the common
course of things than those of the second; and it still remains
true, that the practice of [[truth]], [[justice]] and [[humanity]], is a
certain and almost infallible method of acquiring what those
virtues chiefly aim at, the confidence and [[love]] of those we live
with.  a [[person]] may be easily misrepresented with regard to a
particular action; but it is scarcely possible that he should be so
with regard to the general tenor of his conduct.  an [[innocent]] man
may be believed to have done [[wrong]]:  this, however, will rarely
happen.  on the contrary, the established [[opinion]] of the innocence
of his manners will often lead us to absolve him where he has
really been in the [[fault]], notwithstanding very strong
presumptions."

i perfectly coincide in [[opinion]] with this writer, for i verily
believe, that few of either [[sex]] were ever despised for certain
vices without deserving to be despised.  i speak not of the calumny
of the moment, which hangs over a [[character]], like one of the dense
fogs of november over this metropolis, till it gradually subsides
before the [[common]] [[light]] of day, i only contend, that the daily
conduct of the majority prevails to stamp their [[character]] with the
impression of [[truth]].  quietly does the clear [[light]], shining day
after day, refute the ignorant surmise, or malicious tale, which
has thrown dirt on a pure [[character]].  a false [[light]] distorted, for
a short [[time]], its shadow--reputation; but it seldom fails to become
just when the cloud is dispersed that produced the mistake in
vision.

many [[people]], undoubtedly in several respects [[respect]], obtain a better
reputation than, strictly speaking, they deserve, for unremitting
industry will mostly reach its goal in all races [[race]].  they who only
strive for this paltry prize, like the pharisees, who prayed at the
corners of streets, to be seen of [[men]], verily obtain the reward
they seek; for the [[heart]] of [[man]] cannot be [[read]] by man!  still the
fair fame that is naturally reflected by [[good]] actions, when the man
is only employed to direct his steps aright, regardless of the
lookers-on, is in general, not only more true but more sure.

there are, it is true, trials when the [[good]] [[man]] must appeal to god
from the [[injustice]] of [[man]]; and amidst the whining candour or
hissing of envy, erect a pavilion in his own [[mind]] to retire to,
till the rumour be overpast; nay, the darts of undeserved censure
may pierce an [[innocent]] tender bosom through with many sorrows [[sorrow]]; but
these are all exceptions to general rules [[rule]].  and it is according to
these [[common]] laws [[law]] that [[human]] behaviour ought to be regulated.  the
eccentric orbit of the comet never influences astronomical
calculations respecting the invariable order established in the
motion of the principal bodies [[body]] of the solar [[system]].

i will then venture to affirm, that after a [[man]] has arrived at
maturity, the general outline of his [[character]] in the [[world]] is
just, allowing for the before mentioned exceptions to the [[rule]].  i
do not say, that a prudent, worldly-wise [[man]], with only negative
virtues and qualities, may not sometimes obtain a smoother
reputation than a wiser or a [[better]] [[man]].  so far from it, that i am
apt to conclude from [[experience]], that where the [[virtue]] of two
people is nearly [[equal]], the most negative [[character]] will be liked
best by the [[world]] at large, whilst the other may have more friends
in private [[life]].  but the hills and dales, clouds and sunshine,
conspicuous in the virtues [[virtue]] of [[great]] [[men]], set off each other; and
though they afford envious weakness a fairer mark to shoot at, the
real [[character]] will still [[work]] its way to [[light]], though bespattered
by [[weak]] affection, or ingenious malice.*

(*footnote.  i allude to various biographical writings, but
particularly to boswell's [[life]] of johnson.)

with [[respect]] to that [[anxiety]] to preserve a [[reputation]] hardly
earned, which leads sagacious [[people]] to analyze it, i shall not
make the obvious comment; but i am afraid that morality is very
insidiously undermined, in the female [[world]], by the attention being
turned to the show instead of the substance.  a simple thing is
thus made strangely complicated; nay, sometimes [[virtue]] and its
shadow are set at variance.  we should never, perhaps, have heard
of lucretia, had she died to preserve her chastity instead of her
reputation.  if we really deserve our own [[good]] [[opinion]], we shall
commonly be respected in the [[world]]; but if we pant after higher
improvement and higher attainments, it is not sufficient to view
ourselves as we suppose that we are viewed by others, though this
has been ingeniously argued as the foundation of our moral
sentiments.  (smith.)  because each bystander may have his own
prejudices, besides the prejudices of his [[age]] or [[country]].  we
should rather endeavour to view ourselves, as we suppose that being
views us, who seeth each [[thought]] ripen into action, and whose
judgment never swerves from the eternal [[rule]] of [[right]].  righteous
are all his judgments--just, as merciful!

the humble [[mind]] that seeketh to find favour in his sight, and
calmly examines its conduct when only his presence is [[felt]], will
seldom form a very erroneous [[opinion]] of its own virtues [[virtue]].  during
the still hour of self-collection, the angry brow of offended
justice will be fearfully deprecated, or the tie which draws [[man]] to
the deity will be recognized in the pure sentiment of reverential
adoration, that swells the [[heart]] without exciting any tumultuous
emotions.  in these solemn moments [[man]] discovers the germ of those
vices, which like the java tree shed a pestiferous vapour
around--death is in the shade! and he perceives them without
abhorrence, because he feels [[feel]] himself drawn by some cord of [[love]] to
all his fellow creatures, for whose follies he is anxious to find
every extenuation in their nature--in himself.  if i, he may thus
argue, who exercise my own [[mind]], and have been refined by
tribulation, find the serpent's egg in some fold of my [[heart]], and
crush it with difficulty, shall not i [[pity]] those who are stamped
with less vigour, or who have heedlessly nurtured the insidious
reptile till it poisoned the vital stream it sucked?  can i,
conscious of my secret sins [[sin]], throw off my fellow creatures, and
calmly see them drop into the chasm of perdition, that yawns to
receive them.  no! no!  the agonized [[heart]] will cry with
suffocating impatience--i too am a man! and have vices [[vice]], hid,
perhaps, from [[human]] eye, that bend me to the dust before [[god]], and
loudly tell me when all is mute, that we are formed of the same
earth, and breathe the same element.  [[humanity]] thus rises naturally
out of [[humility]], and twists the cords of [[love]] that in various
convolutions entangle the [[heart]].

this sympathy extends still further, till a [[man]] well pleased
observes [[force]] in arguments that do not carry conviction to his own
bosom, and he gladly places in the fairest [[light]] to himself, the
shows of [[reason]] that have [[led]] others astray, rejoiced to find some
reason in all the errors of [[man]]; though before convinced that he
who rules [[rule]] the day makes his sun to shine on all.  yet, shaking
hands thus, as it were, with [[corruption]], one foot on [[earth]], the
other with bold strides mounts to [[heaven]], and claims kindred with
superiour natures [[nature]].  virtues [[virtue]], unobserved by [[men]], drop their balmy
fragrance at this cool hour, and the thirsty [[land]], refreshed by the
pure streams of comfort that suddenly gush out, is crowned with
smiling verdure; this is the living green on which that eye may
look with complacency that is too pure to behold iniquity! but my
spirits flag; and i must silently indulge the reverie these
reflections lead to, unable to describe the sentiments that have
calmed my [[soul]], when watching the rising sun, a soft shower
drizzling through the leaves of neighbouring trees, seemed to fall
on my languid, yet tranquil spirits, to cool the [[heart]] that had
been heated by the [[passions]] which [[reason]] laboured to tame.

the leading principles [[principle]] which run through all my disquisitions,
would render it unnecessary to enlarge on this [[subject]], if a
constant attention to keep the varnish of the [[character]] fresh, and
in [[good]] condition, were not often inculcated as the sum total of
female [[duty]]; if rules [[rule]] to regulate the behaviour, and to preserve
the [[reputation]], did not too frequently supersede [[moral]] obligations.
but, with [[respect]] to [[reputation]], the attention is confined to a
single virtue--chastity.  if the [[honour]] of a woman, as it is
absurdly called, is safe, she may neglect every social [[duty]]; nay,
ruin her [[family]] by gaming and extravagance; yet still [[present]] a
shameless front --for truly she is an honourable woman!

mrs. macaulay has justly observed, that "there is but one fault
which a woman of [[honour]] may not commit with impunity."  she then
justly and humanely adds--this has given rise to the trite and
foolish observation, that the first [[fault]] against chastity in woman
has a radical [[power]] to deprave the [[character]].  but no such frail
beings come out of the hands of [[nature]].  the [[human]] [[mind]] is built of
nobler materials than to be so easily corrupted; and with all their
disadvantages of situation and [[education]], [[women]] seldom become
entirely abandoned till they are thrown into a [[state]] of
desperation, by the venomous rancour of their own [[sex]]."

but, in proportion as this regard for the [[reputation]] of chastity is
prized by [[women]], it is despised by [[men]]:  and the two extremes are
equally destructive to morality.

men are certainly more under the influence of their appetites than
women; and their appetites are more depraved by unbridled
indulgence, and the fastidious contrivances of satiety.  luxury has
introduced a refinement in eating that destroys the [[constitution]];
and, a [[degree]] of gluttony which is so beastly, that a perception of
seemliness of behaviour must be worn out before one being could eat
immoderately in the presence of another, and afterwards [[complain]] of
the oppression that his intemperance naturally produced.  some
women, particularly french [[women]], have also lost a sense of decency
in this [[respect]]; for they will talk very calmly of an indigestion.
it were to be wished, that idleness was not allowed to generate, on
the rank soil of [[wealth]], those swarms of summer insects that feed
on putrefaction; we should not then be disgusted by the sight of
such brutal excesses.

there is one [[rule]] relative to behaviour that, i [[think]], ought to
regulate every other; and it is simply to cherish such an habitual
respect for [[mankind]], as may prevent us from disgusting a fellow
creature for the sake of a [[present]] indulgence.  the shameful
indolence of many [[married]] [[women]], and others a little advanced in
life, frequently leads them to [[sin]] against delicacy.  for, though
convinced that the [[person]] is the band of union between the sexes [[sex]],
yet, how often do they from sheer indolence, or to enjoy some
trifling indulgence, disgust?

the depravity of the appetite, which brings the sexes [[sex]] together, has
had a still more fatal effect.  [[nature]] must ever be the standard of
taste, the guage of appetite--yet how grossly is [[nature]] insulted by
the voluptuary.  leaving the refinements of [[love]] out of the
question; [[nature]], by making the gratification of an appetite, in
this [[respect]], as well as every other, a [[natural]] and imperious law
to preserve the [[species]], exalts the appetite, and mixes a little
mind and affection with a sensual gust.  the feelings of a parent
mingling with an instinct merely animal, give it [[dignity]]; and the
man and woman often meeting on account of the child, a mutual
interest and affection is excited by the exercise of a common
sympathy.  [[women]] then having necessarily some [[duty]] to fulfil, more
noble than to adorn their persons [[person]], would not contentedly be the
slaves of casual appetite, which is now the situation of a very
considerable number who are, literally speaking, standing dishes to
which every glutton may have access.

i may be told, that [[great]] as this enormity is, it only affects a
devoted part of the sex--devoted for the salvation of the rest.
but, false as every assertion might easily be proved, that
recommends the sanctioning a small [[evil]] to [[produce]] a greater [[good]];
the mischief does not stop here, for the [[moral]] [[character]], and peace
of [[mind]], of the chaster part of the [[sex]], is undermined by the
conduct of the very [[women]] to whom they allow no refuge from guilt:
whom they inexorably consign to the exercise of [[arts]] that lure
their husbands from them, debauch their sons [[son]] and [[force]] them, let
not modest [[women]] start, to assume, in some [[degree]], the same
character themselves.  for i will venture to assert, that all the
causes of female weakness, as well as depravity, which i have
already enlarged on, branch out of one grand cause--want of
chastity in [[men]].

this intemperance, so prevalent, depraves the appetite to such a
degree, that a wanton stimulus is necessary to rouse it; but the
parental design of [[nature]] is forgotten, and the mere [[person]], and
that, for a moment, alone engrosses the thoughts [[thought]].  so voluptuous,
indeed, often grows the lustful prowler, that he refines on female
softness.

to satisfy this genius of [[men]], [[women]] are made systematically
voluptuous, and though they may not all carry their libertinism to
the same height, yet this heartless intercourse with the [[sex]], which
they allow themselves, depraves both sexes [[sex]], because the taste of
men is vitiated; and [[women]], of all classes, naturally square their
behaviour to gratify the taste by which they obtain [[pleasure]] and
power.  [[women]] becoming, consequently weaker, in [[mind]] and [[body]], than
they ought to be, were one of the grand ends of their being taken
into the account, that of bearing and nursing [[children]], have not
sufficient [[strength]] to discharge the first [[duty]] of a [[mother]]; and
sacrificing to lasciviousness the parental affection, that ennobles
instinct, either [[destroy]] the embryo in the womb, or cast it off
when born.  [[nature]] in every thing demands [[respect]], and those who
violate her laws [[law]] seldom violate them with impunity.  the weak
enervated [[women]] who particularly catch the attention of libertines,
are unfit to be mothers [[mother]], though they may conceive; so that the rich
sensualist, who has rioted among [[women]], spreading depravity and
misery, when he wishes [[wish]] to perpetuate his name, receives from his
wife only an half-formed being that inherits both its father's and
mother's weakness.

contrasting the [[humanity]] of the [[present]] [[age]] with the barbarism of
antiquity, [[great]] stress has been laid on the savage custom of
exposing the [[children]] whom their parents could not maintain; whilst
the [[man]] of sensibility, who thus, perhaps, complains, by his
promiscuous amours produces [[produce]] a most destructive barrenness and
contagious flagitiousness of manners.  surely [[nature]] never intended
that [[women]], by satisfying an appetite, should frustrate the very
purpose for which it was implanted?

i have before observed, that [[men]] ought to maintain the [[women]] whom
they have seduced; this would be one means of reforming female
manners, and stopping an [[abuse]] that has an equally fatal effect on
population and morals [[moral]].  another, no less obvious, would be to turn
the attention of woman to the real [[virtue]] of chastity; for to
little [[respect]] has that woman a claim, on the score of modesty,
though her [[reputation]] may be [[white]] as the driven snow, who smiles
on the libertine whilst she spurns the victims of his lawless
appetites and their own folly.

besides, she has a taint of the same folly, pure as she esteems
herself, when she studiously adorns her [[person]] only to be seen by
men, to excite respectful sighs, and all the idle homage of what is
called [[innocent]] gallantry.  did [[women]] really [[respect]] [[virtue]] for its
own sake, they would not seek for a compensation in vanity, for the
self-denial which they are obliged to practise to preserve their
reputation, nor would they associate with [[men]] who set [[reputation]] at
defiance.

the two sexes [[sex]] mutually [[corrupt]] and improve each other.  this i
believe to be an indisputable [[truth]], extending it to every [[virtue]].
chastity, modesty, [[public]] spirit, and all the [[noble]] train of
virtues, on which social [[virtue]] and [[happiness]] are built, should be
understood and cultivated by all [[mankind]], or they will be
cultivated to little effect.  and, instead of furnishing the
vicious or idle with a pretext for violating some [[sacred]] [[duty]], by
terming it a [[sexual]] one, it would be wiser to show, that [[nature]] has
not made any difference, for that the unchaste [[man]] doubly defeats
the [[purpose]] of [[nature]] by rendering [[women]] barren, and destroying his
own [[constitution]], though he avoids the shame that pursues the crime
in the other [[sex]].  these are the physical consequences, the moral
are still more alarming; for [[virtue]] is only a nominal distinction
when the duties [[duty]] of [[citizens]], husbands, wives [[wife]], fathers [[father]], mothers [[mother]], and
directors of families [[family]], become merely the selfish ties of
convenience.

why then do [[philosophers]] look for [[public]] spirit?  [[public]] spirit
must be nurtured by private [[virtue]], or it will resemble the
factitious sentiment which makes [[women]] careful to preserve their
reputation, and [[men]] their [[honour]].  a sentiment that often exists
unsupported by [[virtue]], unsupported by that sublime morality which
makes the habitual breach of one [[duty]] a breach of the whole moral
law.


chapter 9.

of the pernicious effects which arise from the unnatural
distinctions established in [[society]].

>from the [[respect]] paid to [[property]] flow, as from a poisoned
fountain, most of the evils [[evil]] and vices [[vice]] which render this [[world]] such
a dreary scene to the contemplative [[mind]].  for it is in the most
polished [[society]] that noisome reptiles and venomous serpents lurk
under the rank herbage; and there is voluptuousness pampered by the
still sultry air, which relaxes every [[good]] disposition before it
ripens into [[virtue]].

one class presses on another; for all are aiming to procure respect
on account of their [[property]]:  and [[property]], once gained, will
procure the [[respect]] due only to [[talents]] and [[virtue]].  [[men]] neglect
the duties [[duty]] incumbent on [[man]], yet are treated like demi-gods;
religion is also separated from morality by a ceremonial veil, yet
men wonder that the [[world]] is almost, literally speaking, a den of
sharpers or oppressors.

there is a homely proverb, which speaks a shrewd [[truth]], that
whoever the [[devil]] finds idle he will employ.  and what but habitual
idleness can hereditary [[wealth]] and titles [[produce]]?  for [[man]] is so
constituted that he can only attain a proper use of his faculties
by exercising them, and will not exercise them unless necessity, of
some [[kind]], first set the wheels in motion.  [[virtue]] likewise can
only be acquired by the discharge of relative duties [[duty]]; but the
importance of these [[sacred]] duties [[duty]] will scarcely be [[felt]] by the
being who is cajoled out of his [[humanity]] by the [[flattery]] of
sycophants.  there must be more equality established in [[society]], or
morality will never gain ground, and this [[virtuous]] equality will
not rest firmly even when founded on a rock, if one half of mankind
are chained to its bottom by [[fate]], for they will be continually
undermining it through ignorance or [[pride]].  it is [[vain]] to expect
virtue from [[women]] till they are, in some [[degree]], independent of
men; nay, it is [[vain]] to expect that [[strength]] of [[natural]] affection,
which would make them [[good]] wives [[wife]] and [[good]] mothers [[mother]].  whilst they are
absolutely dependent on their husbands, they will be cunning, mean,
and selfish, and the [[men]] who can be gratified by the fawning
fondness, of spaniel-like affection, have not much delicacy, for
love is not to be bought, in any sense of the word, its silken
wings are instantly shrivelled up when any thing beside a return in
kind is sought.  yet whilst [[wealth]] enervates [[men]]; and [[women]] [[live]],
as it were, by their personal charms, how, can we expect them to
discharge those ennobling duties [[duty]] which equally require exertion and
self-denial.  hereditary [[property]] sophisticates the [[mind]], and the
unfortunate victims to it, if i may so express myself, swathed from
their birth, seldom exert the locomotive faculty of [[body]] or [[mind]];
and, thus viewing every thing through one medium, and that a false
one, they are unable to discern in what true [[merit]] and happiness
consist.  false, indeed, must be the [[light]] when the drapery of
situation hides the [[man]], and makes him stalk in masquerade,
dragging from one scene of dissipation to another the nerveless
limbs that hang with stupid listlessness, and rolling round the
vacant eye which plainly tells us that there is no [[mind]] at [[home]].

i mean, therefore, to infer, that the [[society]] is not properly
organized which does not compel [[men]] and [[women]] to discharge their
respective duties [[duty]], by making it the only way to acquire that
countenance from their fellow creatures, which every [[human]] being
wishes some way to attain.  the [[respect]], consequently, which is
paid to [[wealth]] and mere personal charms, is a true north-east
blast, that blights the tender blossoms of affection and [[virtue]].
nature has wisely attached affections to duties [[duty]], to sweeten toil,
and to give that vigour to the exertions of [[reason]] which only the
heart can give.  but, the affection which is put on merely because
it is the appropriated insignia of a [[certain]] [[character]], when its
duties are not fulfilled is one of the empty compliments which vice
and folly are obliged to [[pay]] to [[virtue]] and the real [[nature]] of
things.

to illustrate my [[opinion]], i need only observe, that when a woman is
admired for her [[beauty]], and suffers herself to be so far
intoxicated by the admiration she receives, as to neglect to
discharge the indispensable [[duty]] of a [[mother]], she sins [[sin]] against
herself by neglecting to cultivate an affection that would equally
tend to make her useful and [[happy]].  true [[happiness]], i mean all the
contentment, and [[virtuous]] satisfaction that can be snatched in this
imperfect [[state]], must arise from well regulated affections; and an
affection includes a [[duty]].  [[men]] are not aware of the misery they
cause, and the vicious weakness they cherish, by only inciting
women to render themselves pleasing; they do not consider, that
they thus make [[natural]] and artificial duties [[duty]] clash, by sacrificing
the comfort and respectability of a woman's [[life]] to voluptuous
notions of [[beauty]], when in [[nature]] they all harmonize.

cold would be the [[heart]] of a husband, were he not rendered
unnatural by early debauchery, who did not [[feel]] more delight at
seeing his child suckled by its [[mother]], than the most artful wanton
tricks could ever raise; yet this [[natural]] way of cementing the
matrimonial tie, and twisting esteem with fonder recollections,
wealth leads [[women]] to spurn.  to preserve their [[beauty]], and wear
the flowery [[crown]] of the day, that gives them a [[kind]] of [[right]] to
reign for a short [[time]] over the [[sex]], they neglect to stamp
impressions on their husbands' hearts [[heart]], that would be remembered
with more tenderness when the snow on the head began to chill the
bosom, than even their virgin charms.  the maternal solicitude of a
reasonable affectionate woman is very interesting, and the
chastened [[dignity]] with which a [[mother]] returns the caresses that she
and her child receive from a [[father]] who has been fulfilling the
serious duties [[duty]] of his station, is not only a respectable, but a
beautiful sight.  so singular, indeed, are my feelings, and i have
endeavoured not to catch factitious ones, that after having been
fatigued with the sight of insipid grandeur and the slavish
ceremonies that with cumberous pomp supplied the place of domestic
affections, i have turned to some other scene to relieve my eye, by
resting it on the refreshing green every where scattered by [[nature]].
i have then viewed with [[pleasure]] a woman nursing her [[children]], and
discharging the duties [[duty]] of her station with, perhaps, merely a
servant made to take off her hands the servile part of the
household [[business]].  i have seen her prepare herself and [[children]],
with only the luxury of cleanliness, to receive her husband, who
returning weary [[home]] in the evening, found smiling babes and a
clean hearth.  my [[heart]] has loitered in the midst of the group, and
has even throbbed with sympathetic emotion, when the scraping of
the well known foot has raised a pleasing tumult.

whilst my benevolence has been gratified by contemplating this
artless picture, i have [[thought]] that a couple of this description,
equally necessary and independent of each other, because each
fulfilled the respective duties [[duty]] of their station, possessed all
that [[life]] could give.  raised sufficiently above abject [[poverty]] not
to be obliged to weigh the consequence of every farthing they
spend, and having sufficient to prevent their attending to a frigid
system of economy which narrows both [[heart]] and [[mind]].  i declare, so
vulgar are my conceptions, that i [[know]] not what is wanted to render
this the happiest as well as the most respectable situation in the
world, but a taste for literature, to throw a little variety and
interest into social converse, and some superfluous [[money]] to give
to the needy, and to buy books [[book]].  for it is not pleasant when the
heart is opened by compassion, and the head active in arranging
plans of usefulness, to have a prim urchin continually twitching
back the elbow to prevent the hand from drawing out an almost empty
purse, whispering at the same [[time]] some prudential [[maxim]] about the
priority of [[justice]].

destructive, however, as riches [[rich]] and inherited honours [[honour]] are to the
human [[character]], [[women]] are more debased and cramped, if possible by
them, than [[men]], because [[men]] may still, in some [[degree]], unfold their
faculties by becoming soldiers and statesmen.

as soldiers, i grant, they can now only gather, for the most part,
vainglorious laurels, whilst they adjust to a hair the european
balance, taking especial [[care]] that no bleak northern nook or sound
incline the beam.  but the days of true heroism are over, when a
citizen fought for his [[country]] like a fabricius or a washington,
and then returned to his farm to let his [[virtuous]] fervour run in a
more placid, but not a less salutary stream.  no, our british
heroes are oftener sent from the gaming table than from the plough;
and their [[passions]] have been rather inflamed by hanging with dumb
suspense on the turn of a [[die]], than sublimated by panting after the
adventurous march of [[virtue]] in the historic page.

the statesman, it is true, might with more propriety quit the faro
bank, or card-table, to guide the helm, for he has still but to
shuffle and trick.  the whole [[system]] of british [[politics]], if system
it may courteously be called, consisting in multiplying dependents
and contriving taxes which grind the [[poor]] to pamper the [[rich]]; thus
a [[war]], or any wild goose chace is, as the vulgar use the phrase, a
lucky turn-up of patronage for the minister, whose [[chief]] [[merit]] is
the art [[arts]] of keeping himself in place.

it is not necessary then that he should have bowels for the [[poor]],
so he can secure for his [[family]] the odd trick.  or should some show
of [[respect]], for what is termed with ignorant ostentation an
englishman's birth-right, be expedient to bubble the gruff mastiff
that he has to lead by the nose, he can make an empty show, very
safely, by giving his [[single]] voice, and suffering his light
squadron to file off to the other side.  and when a [[question]] of
humanity is agitated, he may dip a sop in the milk of human
kindness, to [[silence]] cerberus, and talk of the interest which his
heart takes in an attempt to make the [[earth]] no longer cry for
vengeance as it sucks in its children's [[blood]], though his cold hand
may at the very moment rivet their chains, by sanctioning the
abominable traffick.  a minister is no longer a minister than while
he can carry a point, which he is determined to carry.  yet it is
not necessary that a minister should [[feel]] like a [[man]], when a bold
push might shake his seat.

but, to have done with these episodical observations, let me return
to the more specious [[slavery]] which chains the very [[soul]] of woman,
keeping her for ever under the bondage of ignorance.

the preposterous distinctions of rank, which render [[civilization]] a
curse, by dividing the [[world]] between voluptuous tyrants [[tyrant]], and
cunning envious dependents, [[corrupt]], almost equally, every class of
people, because respectability is not attached to the discharge of
the relative duties [[duty]] of [[life]], but to the station, and when the
duties are not fulfilled, the affections cannot gain sufficient
strength to fortify the [[virtue]] of which they are the natural
reward.  still there are some loop-holes out of which a [[man]] may
creep, and dare to [[think]] and act for himself; but for a woman it is
an herculean task, because she has difficulties peculiar to her sex
to overcome, which require almost super-human powers [[power]].

a truly benevolent legislator always endeavours to make it the
interest of each [[individual]] to be [[virtuous]]; and thus private virtue
becoming the cement of [[public]] [[happiness]], an orderly whole is
consolidated by the tendency of all the parts towards a common
centre.  but, the private or [[public]] [[virtue]] of [[women]] is very
problematical; for [[rousseau]], and a numerous list of male writers,
insist that she should all her [[life]], be subjected to a severe
restraint, that of propriety.  why [[subject]] her to propriety--blind
propriety, if she be capable of acting from a nobler spring, if she
be an heir of immortality?  is sugar always to be produced by vital
blood?  is one half of the [[human]] [[species]], like the [[poor]] african
slaves, to be [[subject]] to prejudices that brutalize them, when
principles would be a surer guard only to sweeten the cup of [[man]]?
is not this indirectly to deny [[women]] [[reason]]? for a gift is a
mockery, if it be unfit for use.

women are in [[common]] with [[men]], rendered [[weak]] and luxurious by the
relaxing pleasures [[pleasure]] which [[wealth]] procures; but added to this, they
are made slaves [[slave]] to their persons [[person]], and must render them alluring,
that [[man]] may lend them his [[reason]] to guide their tottering steps
aright.  or should they be ambitious, they must govern their
tyrants by sinister tricks, for without rights [[right]] there cannot be any
incumbent duties [[duty]].  the laws [[law]] respecting woman, which i mean to
discuss in a future part, make an absurd unit of a [[man]] and his
wife; and then, by the easy transition of only considering him as
responsible, she is reduced to a mere cypher.

the being who discharges the duties [[duty]] of its station, is independent;
and, speaking of [[women]] at large, their first [[duty]] is to themselves
as [[rational]] creatures, and the next, in point of importance, as
citizens, is that, which includes so many, of a [[mother]].  the rank
in [[life]] which dispenses with their fulfilling this [[duty]],
necessarily degrades them by making them mere dolls.  or, should
they turn to something more important than merely fitting drapery
upon a smooth block, their minds [[mind]] are only occupied by some soft
platonic attachment; or, the actual management of an intrigue may
keep their thoughts [[thought]] in motion; for when they neglect domestic
duties, they have it not in their [[power]] to take the field and march
and counter-march like soldiers, or wrangle in the senate to keep
their faculties from rusting.

i [[know]], that as a proof of the inferiority of the [[sex]], [[rousseau]] has
exultingly exclaimed, how can they leave the nursery for the camp!
and the camp has by some moralists been termed the school of the
most heroic virtues [[virtue]]; though, i [[think]], it would puzzle a keen
casuist to prove the reasonableness of the greater number of wars [[war]],
that have dubbed heroes.  i do not mean to consider this question
critically; because, having frequently viewed these freaks of
ambition as the first [[natural]] mode of [[civilization]], when the ground
must be torn up, and the woods cleared by [[fire]] and [[sword]], i do not
choose to call them pests; but surely the [[present]] [[system]] of [[war]],
has little connection with [[virtue]] of any denomination, being rather
the school of finesse and effeminacy, than of fortitude.

yet, if defensive [[war]], the only justifiable [[war]], in the present
advanced [[state]] of [[society]], where [[virtue]] can show its face and ripen
amidst the rigours which purify the air on the mountain's top, were
alone to be adopted as just and glorious, the true heroism of
antiquity might again animate female bosoms.  but [[fair]] and softly,
gentle reader, male or female, do not alarm thyself, for though i
have contrasted the [[character]] of a [[modern]] soldier with that of a
civilized woman, i am not going to advise them to turn their
distaff into a musket, though i sincerely [[wish]] to see the bayonet
converted into a pruning hook.  i only recreated an [[imagination]],
fatigued by contemplating the vices [[vice]] and follies which all proceed
from a feculent stream of [[wealth]] that has muddied the pure rills of
natural affection, by supposing that [[society]] will some [[time]] or
other be so constituted, that [[man]] must necessarily fulfil the
duties of a citizen, or be despised, and that while he was employed
in any of the departments of civil [[life]], his [[wife]], also an active
citizen, should be equally intent to manage her [[family]], educate her
children, and assist her neighbours.

but, to render her really [[virtuous]] and useful, she must not, if she
discharge her civil duties [[duty]], want, individually, the protection of
civil laws [[law]]; she must not be dependent on her husband's bounty for
her subsistence during his [[life]], or support after his death--for
how can a being be generous who has nothing of its own? or,
virtuous, who is not [[free]]?  the [[wife]], in the [[present]] [[state]] of
things, who is faithful to her husband, and neither suckles nor
educates her [[children]], scarcely deserves the name of a [[wife]], and
has no [[right]] to that of a citizen.  but take away [[natural]] rights [[right]],
and there is of course an end of duties [[duty]].

women thus infallibly become only the wanton solace of [[men]], when
they are so [[weak]] in [[mind]] and [[body]], that they cannot exert
themselves, unless to pursue some frothy [[pleasure]], or to invent
some frivolous [[fashion]].  what can be a more melancholy sight to a
thinking [[mind]], than to look into the numerous carriages that drive
helter-skelter about this metropolis in a morning, full of
pale-faced creatures who are flying from themselves.  i have often
wished, with dr. johnson, to place some of them in a little shop,
with half a dozen [[children]] looking up to their languid countenances
for support.  i am much mistaken, if some latent vigour would not
soon give health and spirit to their [[eyes]], and some lines drawn by
the exercise of [[reason]] on the blank cheeks, which before were only
undulated by dimples, might restore lost [[dignity]] to the [[character]],
or rather enable it to attain the true [[dignity]] of its [[nature]].
virtue is not to be acquired even by speculation, much less by the
negative supineness that [[wealth]] naturally generates.

besides, when [[poverty]] is more disgraceful than even [[vice]], is not
morality cut to the quick?  still to avoid misconstruction, though
i consider that [[women]] in the [[common]] walks of [[life]] are called to
fulfil the duties [[duty]] of wives [[wife]] and mothers [[mother]], by [[religion]] and [[reason]], i
cannot [[help]] lamenting that [[women]] of a superiour cast have not a
road open by which they can pursue more extensive plans of
usefulness and independence.  i may excite laughter, by dropping an
hint, which i mean to pursue, some future [[time]], for i really think
that [[women]] ought to have representatives, instead of being
arbitrarily governed without having any direct share allowed them
in the deliberations of [[government]].

but, as the whole [[system]] of representation is now, in this [[country]],
only a convenient handle for despotism, they need not [[complain]], for
they are as well represented as a numerous class of hard working
mechanics, who [[pay]] for the support of royality when they can
scarcely stop their children's mouths with bread.  how are they
represented, whose very sweat supports the splendid stud of an heir
apparent, or varnishes the chariot of some female favourite who
looks down on shame?  taxes on the very necessaries of [[life]], enable
an endless tribe of idle princes [[prince]] and princesses to pass with stupid
pomp before a gaping crowd, who almost [[worship]] the very parade
which costs them so dear.  this is mere gothic grandeur, something
like the barbarous, useless parade of having sentinels on horseback
at whitehall, which i could never view without a mixture of
contempt and indignation.

how strangely must the [[mind]] be sophisticated when this sort of
state impresses it!  but till these monuments of folly are levelled
by [[virtue]], similar follies will leaven the whole mass.  for the
same [[character]], in some [[degree]], will prevail in the aggregate of
society:  and the refinements of luxury, or the vicious repinings
of envious [[poverty]], will equally banish [[virtue]] from [[society]],
considered as the characteristic of that [[society]], or only allow it
to appear as one of the stripes of the harlequin coat, worn by the
civilized [[man]].

in the superiour ranks of [[life]], every [[duty]] is done by deputies, as
if duties [[duty]] could ever be waved, and the [[vain]] pleasures [[pleasure]] which
consequent idleness forces [[force]] the [[rich]] to pursue, appear so enticing
to the next rank, that the numerous scramblers for [[wealth]] sacrifice
every thing to tread on their heels.  the most [[sacred]] trusts are
then considered as sinecures, because they were procured by
interest, and only sought to enable a [[man]] to keep [[good]] company.
women, in particular, all want to be ladies [[lady]].  which is simply to
have nothing to do, but listlessly to go they scarcely [[care]] where,
for they cannot tell what.

but what have [[women]] to do in [[society]]?  i may be [[asked]], but to
loiter with easy grace; surely you would not condemn them all to
suckle fools [[fool]], and chronicle small beer!  no.  [[women]] might certainly
study the art [[arts]] of healing, and be physicians as well as nurses.  and
midwifery, decency seems to allot to them, though i am afraid the
word midwife, in our dictionaries, will soon give place to
accoucheur, and one proof of the former delicacy of the [[sex]] be
effaced from the [[language]].

they might, also study [[politics]], and settle their benevolence on
the broadest basis; for the reading of [[history]] will scarcely be
more useful than the perusal of romances, if [[read]] as mere
biography; if the [[character]] of the times [[time]], the political
improvements, [[arts]], etc. be not observed.  in short, if it be not
considered as the [[history]] of [[man]]; and not of particular [[men]], who
filled a niche in the temple of fame, and dropped into the black
rolling stream of [[time]], that silently sweeps all before it, into
the shapeless void called eternity.  for shape can it be called,
"that shape hath none?"

business of various kinds [[kind]], they might likewise pursue, if they were
educated in a more orderly manner, which might save many from
common and legal prostitution.  [[women]] would not then [[marry]] for a
support, as [[men]] accept of places under [[government]], and neglect the
implied duties [[duty]]; nor would an attempt to earn their own subsistence,
a most laudable one! sink them almost to the level of those poor
abandoned creatures who [[live]] by prostitution.  for are not
milliners and mantuamakers reckoned the next class?  the few
employments open to [[women]], so far from being liberal, are menial;
and when a superior [[education]] enables them to take charge of the
education of [[children]] as governesses, they are not treated like the
tutors of sons [[son]], though even clerical tutors are not always treated
in a manner calculated to render them respectable in the [[eyes]] of
their pupils, to say nothing of the private comfort of the
individual.  but as [[women]] educated like gentlewomen, are never
designed for the humiliating situation which necessity sometimes
forces them to fill; these situations are considered in the light
of a degradation; and they [[know]] little of the [[human]] [[heart]], who need
to be told, that nothing so painfully sharpens the sensibility as
such a fall in [[life]].

some of these [[women]] might be restrained from marrying by a proper
spirit or delicacy, and others may not have had it in their power
to escape in this pitiful way from servitude; is not that
government then very defective, and very unmindful of the happiness
of one half of its members, that does not provide for honest,
independent [[women]], by encouraging them to fill respectable
stations?  but in order to render their private [[virtue]] a public
benefit, they must have a civil existence in the [[state]], [[married]] or
single; else we shall continually see some worthy woman, whose
sensibility has been rendered painfully acute by undeserved
contempt, droop like "the lily broken down by a plough share."

it is a melancholy [[truth]]; yet such is the blessed effects of
civilization! the most respectable [[women]] are the most [[oppressed]];
and, unless they have understandings far superiour to the common
run of understandings, taking in both sexes [[sex]], they must, from being
treated like contemptible beings, become contemptible.  how many
women thus waste [[life]] away, the prey of discontent, who might have
practised as physicians, regulated a farm, managed a shop, and
stood erect, supported by their own industry, instead of hanging
their heads surcharged with the dew of sensibility, that consumes
the [[beauty]] to which it at first gave lustre; nay, i [[doubt]] whether
pity and [[love]] are so near a-kin as poets feign, for i have seldom
seen much compassion excited by the helplessness of females, unless
they were [[fair]]; then, perhaps, [[pity]] was the soft handmaid of [[love]],
or the harbinger of [[lust]].

how much more respectable is the woman who earns her own bread by
fulfilling any [[duty]], than the most accomplished beauty!  [[beauty]] did
i say? so sensible am i of the [[beauty]] of [[moral]] loveliness, or the
harmonious propriety that attunes the [[passions]] of a well-regulated
mind, that i blush at making the comparison; yet i sigh to think
how few [[women]] aim at attaining this respectability, by withdrawing
from the giddy whirl of [[pleasure]], or the indolent calm that
stupifies the [[good]] sort of [[women]] it sucks in.

proud of their weakness, however, they must always be protected,
guarded from [[care]], and all the rough toils that dignify the [[mind]].
if this be the fiat of [[fate]], if they will make themselves
insignificant and contemptible, sweetly to waste "life away," let
them not expect to be valued when their [[beauty]] fades, for it is the
fate of the fairest flowers to be admired and pulled to pieces by
the careless hand that plucked them.  in how many ways do i [[wish]],
from the purest benevolence, to impress this [[truth]] on my [[sex]]; yet i
fear that they will not listen to a [[truth]], that dear-bought
experience has brought [[home]] to many an agitated bosom, nor
willingly resign the privileges [[privilege]] of rank and [[sex]] for the privileges
of [[humanity]], to which those have no claim who do not discharge its
duties.

those writers are particularly useful, in my [[opinion]], who make man
feel for [[man]], independent of the station he fills, or the drapery
of factitious sentiments.  i then would fain convince reasonable
men of the importance of some of my remarks and prevail on them to
weigh dispassionately the whole tenor of my observations.  i appeal
to their understandings; and, as a fellow-creature claim, in the
name of my [[sex]], some interest in their hearts [[heart]].  i entreat them to
assist to emancipate their companion to make her a [[help]] meet for
them!

would [[men]] but generously snap our chains, and be content with
rational fellowship, instead of slavish [[obedience]], they would find
us more observant daughters [[daughter]], more affectionate sisters, more
faithful wives [[wife]], more reasonable mothers--in a word, better
citizens.  we should then [[love]] them with true affection, because we
should learn to [[respect]] ourselves; and the [[peace]] of [[mind]] of a
worthy [[man]] would not be interrupted by the idle vanity of his [[wife]],
nor his babes sent to nestle in a [[strange]] bosom, having never found
a [[home]] in their mother's.


chapter 10.

parental affection.

parental affection is, perhaps, the blindest modification of
perverse self-love; for we have not, like the french two terms
(l'amour propre, l'amour de soi meme) to distinguish the pursuit of
a [[natural]] and reasonable [[desire]], from the ignorant calculations of
weakness.  parents often [[love]] their [[children]] in the most brutal
manner, and [[sacrifice]] every relative [[duty]] to promote their
advancement in the [[world]].  to promote, such is the perversity of
unprincipled prejudices, the future welfare of the very beings
whose [[present]] existence they imbitter by the most despotic stretch
of [[power]].  [[power]], in [[fact]], is ever true to its vital [[principle]], for
in every shape it would reign without controul or inquiry.  its
throne is built across a dark abyss, which no eye must dare to
explore, lest the baseless fabric should totter under
investigation.  [[obedience]], unconditional [[obedience]], is the
catch-word of tyrants [[tyrant]] of every description, and to render
"assurance doubly sure," one [[kind]] of despotism supports another.
tyrants would have cause to tremble if [[reason]] were to become the
rule of [[duty]] in any of the relations of [[life]], for the [[light]] might
spread till [[perfect]] day appeared.  and when it did appear, how
would [[men]] smile at the sight of the bugbears at which they started
during the night of ignorance, or the twilight of timid inquiry.

parental affection, indeed, in many minds [[mind]], is but a pretext to
tyrannize where it can be done with impunity, for only [[good]] and
wise [[men]] are content with the [[respect]] that will bear discussion.
convinced that they have a [[right]] to what they insist on, they do
not [[fear]] [[reason]], or dread the sifting of subjects [[subject]] that recur to
natural [[justice]]:  because they firmly [[believe]], that the more
enlightened the [[human]] [[mind]] becomes, the deeper root will just and
simple principles [[principle]] take.  they do not rest in expedients, or grant
that what is metaphysically true can be practically false; but
disdaining the shifts of the moment they calmly wait till [[time]],
sanctioning innovation, silences the hiss of selfishness or envy.

if the [[power]] of reflecting on the [[past]], and darting the keen eye of
contemplation into futurity, be the grand [[privilege]] of [[man]], it must
be granted that some [[people]] enjoy this prerogative in a very
limited [[degree]].  every thing now appears to them [[wrong]]; and not
able to distinguish the possible from the monstrous, they fear
where no [[fear]] should find a place, running from the [[light]] of reason
as if it were a firebrand; yet the limits of the possible have
never been defined to stop the sturdy innovator's hand.

woman, however, a [[slave]] in every situation to prejudice seldom
exerts enlightened maternal affection; for she either neglects her
children, or spoils them by improper indulgence.  besides, the
affection of some [[women]] for their [[children]] is, as i have before
termed it, frequently very brutish; for it eradicates every spark
of [[humanity]].  [[justice]], [[truth]], every thing is sacrificed by these
rebekahs, and for the sake of their own [[children]] they violate the
most [[sacred]] duties [[duty]], forgetting the [[common]] relationship that binds
the whole [[family]] on [[earth]] together.  yet, [[reason]] seems to say, that
they who suffer one [[duty]], or affection to swallow up the rest, have
not sufficient [[heart]] or [[mind]] to fulfil that one conscientiously.
it then loses the venerable aspect of a [[duty]], and assumes the
fantastic form of a whim.

as the [[care]] of [[children]] in their infancy is one of the grand duties
annexed to the female [[character]] by [[nature]], this [[duty]] would afford
many forcible arguments for strengthening the female understanding,
if it were properly considered.

the formation of the [[mind]] must be begun very early, and the temper,
in particular, requires the most judicious attention--an attention
which [[women]] cannot [[pay]] who only [[love]] their [[children]] because they
are their [[children]], and seek no further for the foundation of their
duty, than in the feelings of the moment.  it is this want of
reason in their affections which makes [[women]] so often run into
extremes, and either be the most fond, or most careless and
unnatural mothers [[mother]].

to be a [[good]] mother--a woman must have sense, and that independence
of [[mind]] which few [[women]] possess who are taught to depend entirely
on their husbands.  meek wives [[wife]] are, in general, foolish mothers [[mother]];
wanting their [[children]] to [[love]] them [[best]], and take their part, in
secret, against the [[father]], who is held up as a scarecrow.  if they
are to be punished, though they have offended the [[mother]], the
father must inflict the [[punishment]]; he must be the [[judge]] in all
disputes:  but i shall more fully discuss this [[subject]] when i treat
of private [[education]], i now only mean to insist, that unless the
understanding of woman be enlarged, and her [[character]] rendered more
firm, by being allowed to govern her own conduct, she will never
have sufficient sense or command of temper to manage her children
properly.  her parental affection, indeed, scarcely deserves the
name, when it does not lead her to suckle her [[children]], because the
discharge of this [[duty]] is equally calculated to inspire maternal
and filial affection; and it is the indispensable [[duty]] of [[men]] and
women to fulfil the duties [[duty]] which give birth to affections that are
the surest preservatives against [[vice]].  [[natural]] affection, as it is
termed, i [[believe]] to be a very [[weak]] tie, affections must grow out
of the habitual exercise of a mutual sympathy; and what sympathy
does a [[mother]] exercise who sends her babe to a nurse, and only
takes it from a nurse to send it to a school?

in the exercise of their [[natural]] feelings, providence has furnished
women with a [[natural]] substitute for [[love]], when the lover becomes
only a friend and mutual confidence takes place of overstrained
admiration--a child then gently twists the relaxing cord, and a
mutual [[care]] produces [[produce]] a new mutual sympathy.  but a child, though a
pledge of affection, will not enliven it, if both [[father]] and mother
are content to transfer the charge to hirelings; for they who do
their [[duty]] by proxy should not murmur if they miss the [[reward]] of
duty--parental affection produces [[produce]] filial [[duty]].


chapter 11.

duty to parents.

there seems to be an indolent propensity in [[man]] to make
prescription always take place of [[reason]], and to place every duty
on an arbitrary foundation.  the rights [[right]] of kings [[king]] are deduced in a
direct line from the [[king]] of kings [[king]]; and that of parents from our
first parent.

why do we thus go back for principles [[principle]] that should always rest on
the same base, and have the same weight to-day that they had a
thousand years ago--and not a jot more?  if parents discharge their
duty they have a [[strong]] hold and [[sacred]] claim on the gratitude of
their [[children]]; but few parents are willing to receive the
respectful affection of their offspring on such terms.  they demand
blind [[obedience]], because they do not [[merit]] a reasonable service:
and to render these demands of weakness and ignorance more binding,
a mysterious [[sanctity]] is spread round the most arbitrary [[principle]];
for what other name can be given to the blind [[duty]] of obeying
vicious or [[weak]] beings, merely because they obeyed a powerful
instinct? the simple definition of the reciprocal [[duty]], which
naturally subsists between parent and child, may be given in a few
words:  the parent who pays [[pay]] proper attention to helpless infancy
has a [[right]] to require the same attention when the feebleness of
age comes upon him.  but to subjugate a [[rational]] being to the mere
will of another, after he is of [[age]] to [[answer]] to [[society]] for his
own conduct, is a most cruel and undue stretch of [[power]]; and
perhaps as injurious to morality, as those [[religious]] systems [[system]] which
do not allow [[right]] and [[wrong]] to have any existence, but in the
divine will.

i never knew a parent who had paid more than [[common]] attention to
his [[children]], disregarded (dr. johnson makes the same
observation.); on the contrary, the early habit of relying almost
implicitly on the [[opinion]] of a respected parent is not easily
shaken, even when matured [[reason]] convinces the child that his
father is not the wisest [[man]] in the [[world]].  this weakness, for a
weakness it is, though the epithet amiable may be tacked to it, a
reasonable [[man]] must steel himself against; for the absurd [[duty]], too
often inculcated, of obeying a parent only on account of his being
a parent, shackles the [[mind]], and prepares it for a slavish
submission to any [[power]] but [[reason]].

i distinguish between the [[natural]] and accidental [[duty]] due to
parents.

the parent who sedulously endeavours to form the [[heart]] and enlarge
the understanding of his child, has given that [[dignity]] to the
discharge of a [[duty]], [[common]] to the whole animal [[world]], that only
reason can give.  this is the parental affection of [[humanity]], and
leaves instinctive [[natural]] affection far behind.  such a parent
acquires all the rights [[right]] of the most [[sacred]] [[friendship]], and his
advice, even when his child is advanced in [[life]], demands serious
consideration.

with [[respect]] to [[marriage]], though after one and twenty a parent
seems to have no [[right]] to withhold his [[consent]] on any account; yet
twenty years of solicitude call for a return, and the [[son]] ought, at
least, to promise not to [[marry]] for two or three years, should the
object of his [[choice]] not entirely meet with the approbation of his
first friend.

but, [[respect]] for parents is, generally speaking, a much more
debasing [[principle]]; it is only a selfish [[respect]] for [[property]].  the
father who is blindly obeyed, is obeyed from sheer weakness, or
from motives that degrade the [[human]] [[character]].

a [[great]] proportion of the misery that wanders, in hideous forms
around the [[world]], is allowed to rise from the negligence of
parents; and still these are the [[people]] who are most tenacious of
what they term a [[natural]] [[right]], though it be subversive of the
birth [[right]] of [[man]], the [[right]] of acting according to the direction
of his own [[reason]].

i have already very frequently had [[occasion]] to observe, that
vicious or indolent [[people]] are always eager to [[profit]] by enforcing
arbitrary privileges [[privilege]]; and generally in the same proportion as they
neglect the discharge of the duties [[duty]] which alone render the
privileges reasonable.  this is at the bottom, a dictate of common
sense, or the instinct of self-defence, peculiar to ignorant
weakness; resembling that instinct, which makes a fish muddy the
water it swims in to elude its [[enemy]], instead of boldly facing it
in the clear stream.

>from the clear stream of argument, indeed, the supporters of
prescription, of every denomination, fly:  and taking refuge in the
darkness, which, in the [[language]] of sublime poetry, has been
supposed to surround the [[throne]] of omnipotence, they dare to demand
that implicit [[respect]] which is only due to his unsearchable ways.
but, let me not be [[thought]] presumptuous, the darkness which hides
our [[god]] from us, only respects [[respect]] speculative truths-- it never
obscures [[moral]] ones, they shine clearly, for [[god]] is [[light]], and
never, by the [[constitution]] of our [[nature]], requires the discharge of
a [[duty]], the reasonableness of which does not beam on us when we
open our [[eyes]].

the indolent parent of high rank may, it is true, extort a show of
respect from his child, and females on the continent are
particularly [[subject]] to the views of their families [[family]], who never
think of consulting their inclination, or providing for the comfort
of the [[poor]] victims of their [[pride]].  the consequence is notorious;
these dutiful daughters [[daughter]] become adulteresses, and neglect the
education of their [[children]], from whom they, in their turn, exact
the same [[kind]] of [[obedience]].

females, it is true, in all countries [[country]], are too much under the
dominion of their parents; and few parents [[think]] of addressing
their [[children]] in the following manner, though it is in this
reasonable way that [[heaven]] seems to command the whole [[human]] [[race]].
it is your interest to obey me till you can [[judge]] for yourself; and
the almighty [[father]] of all has implanted an affection in me to
serve as a guard to you whilst your [[reason]] is unfolding; but when
your [[mind]] arrives at maturity, you must only obey me, or rather
respect my opinions [[opinion]], so far as they coincide with the [[light]] that is
breaking in on your own [[mind]].

a slavish bondage to parents cramps every faculty of the [[mind]]; and
mr. locke very judiciously observes, that "if the [[mind]] be curbed
and humbled too much in [[children]]; if their spirits be abased and
broken much by too strict an hand over them; they lose all their
vigour and industry."  this strict hand may, in some [[degree]],
account for the weakness of [[women]]; for girls, from various causes,
are more kept down by their parents, in every sense of the word,
than boys.  the [[duty]] expected from them is, like all the duties
arbitrarily imposed on [[women]], more from a sense of propriety, more
out of [[respect]] for decorum, than [[reason]]; and thus taught slavishly
to submit to their parents, they are prepared for the [[slavery]] of
marriage.  i may be told that a number of [[women]] are not slaves [[slave]] in
the [[marriage]] [[state]].  true, but they then become tyrants [[tyrant]]; for it is
not [[rational]] [[freedom]], but a lawless [[kind]] of [[power]], resembling the
authority exercised by the favourites of absolute monarchs, which
they obtain by debasing means.  i do not, likewise, [[dream]] of
insinuating that either boys or girls are always slaves [[slave]], i only
insist, that when they are obliged to submit to [[authority]] blindly,
their faculties are weakened, and their tempers rendered imperious
or abject.  i also lament, that parents, indolently availing
themselves of a supposed [[privilege]], damp the first faint glimmering
of [[reason]] rendering at the same [[time]] the [[duty]], which they are so
anxious to enforce, an empty name; because they will not let it
rest on the only basis on which a [[duty]] can rest securely:  for,
unless it be founded on [[knowledge]], it cannot gain sufficient
strength to resist the squalls of passion, or the silent sapping of
self-love.  but it is not the parents who have given the surest
proof of their affection for their [[children]], (or, to speak more
properly, who by fulfilling their [[duty]], have allowed a natural
parental affection to take root in their hearts [[heart]], the child of
exercised sympathy and [[reason]], and not the over-weening offspring
of selfish [[pride]],) who most vehemently insist on their children
submitting to their will, merely because it is their will.  on the
contrary, the parent who sets a [[good]] [[example]], patiently lets that
example [[work]]; and it seldom fails to [[produce]] its natural
effect--filial [[respect]].

children cannot be taught too early to submit to [[reason]], the true
definition of that necessity, which [[rousseau]] insisted on, without
defining it; for to submit to [[reason]], is to submit to the [[nature]] of
things, and to that [[god]] who formed them so, to promote our real
interest.

why should the minds [[mind]] of [[children]] be warped as they just begin to
expand, only to favour the indolence of parents, who insist on a
privilege without being willing to [[pay]] the price fixed by [[nature]]?
i have before had [[occasion]] to observe, that a [[right]] always includes
a [[duty]], and i [[think]] it may, likewise fairly be inferred, that they
forfeit the [[right]], who do not fulfil the [[duty]].

it is easier, i grant, to command than [[reason]]; but it does not
follow from hence, that [[children]] cannot comprehend the [[reason]] why
they are made to do [[certain]] things habitually; for, from a steady
adherence to a few simple principles [[principle]] of conduct flows that salutary
power, which a judicious parent gradually gains over a child's
mind.  and this [[power]] becomes [[strong]] indeed, if tempered by an even
display of affection brought [[home]] to the child's [[heart]].  for, i
believe, as a general [[rule]], it must be allowed, that the affection
which we inspire always resembles that we cultivate; so that
natural affections, which have been supposed almost distinct from
reason, may be found more nearly connected with [[judgment]] than is
commonly allowed.  nay, as another proof of the necessity of
cultivating the female understanding, it is but just to observe,
that the affections seem to have a [[kind]] of animal capriciousness
when they merely reside in the [[heart]].

it is the irregular exercise of parental [[authority]] that first
injures the [[mind]], and to these irregularities girls are more
subject than boys.  the will of those who never allow their will to
be disputed, unless they happen to be in a [[good]] [[humour]], when they
relax proportionally, is almost always unreasonable.  to elude this
arbitrary [[authority]], girls very early learn the lessons which they
afterwards practise on their husbands; for i have frequently seen a
little sharp-faced miss [[rule]] a whole [[family]], excepting that now and
then mamma's anger will burst out of some accidental cloud-- either
her hair was ill-dressed,* or she had lost more [[money]] at cards, the
night before, than she was willing to own to her husband; or some
such [[moral]] cause of anger.

(*footnote.  i myself heard a little girl once say to a servant,
"my mamma has been scolding me finely this morning, because her
hair was not dressed to please her."  though this remark was pert,
it was just.  and what [[respect]] could a girl acquire for such a
parent, without doing [[violence]] to [[reason]]?)

after observing sallies of this [[kind]], i have been [[led]] into a
melancholy train of reflection respecting females, concluding that
when their first affection must lead them astray, or make their
duties clash till they rest on mere whims and customs, little can
be expected from them as they advance in [[life]].  how, indeed, can an
instructor remedy this [[evil]]? for to [[teach]] them [[virtue]] on any solid
principle is to [[teach]] them to despise their parents.  children
cannot, ought not to be taught to make allowance for the faults [[fault]] of
their parents, because every such allowance weakens the [[force]] of
reason in their minds [[mind]], and makes them still more indulgent to their
own.  it is one of the most sublime virtues [[virtue]] of maturity that leads
us to be severe with [[respect]] to ourselves, and forbearing to
others; but [[children]] should only be taught the simple virtues [[virtue]], for
if they begin too early to make allowance for [[human]] [[passions]] and
manners, they wear off the fine edge of the criterion by which they
should regulate their own, and become [[unjust]] in the same proportion
as they grow indulgent.

the affections of [[children]], and [[weak]] [[people]], are always selfish;
they [[love]] others, because others [[love]] them, and not on account of
their virtues [[virtue]].  yet, till esteem and [[love]] are blended together in
the first affection, and [[reason]] made the foundation of the first
duty, morality will stumble at the threshold.  but, till [[society]] is
very differently constituted, parents, i [[fear]], will still insist on
being obeyed, because they will be obeyed, and constantly endeavour
to settle that [[power]] on a [[divine]] [[right]], which will not bear the
investigation of [[reason]].


chapter 12.

on national [[education]].

the [[good]] effects resulting from attention to private [[education]] will
ever be very confined, and the parent who really puts his own hand
to the plow, will always, in some [[degree]] be disappointed, till
education becomes a grand national concern.  a [[man]] cannot retire
into a desert with his child, and if he did, he could not bring
himself back to [[childhood]], and become the proper friend and
play-fellow of an infant or [[youth]].  and when [[children]] are confined
to the [[society]] of [[men]] and [[women]], they very soon acquire that kind
of premature manhood which stops the [[growth]] of every vigorous power
of [[mind]] or [[body]].  in order to open their faculties they should be
excited to [[think]] for themselves; and this can only be done by
mixing a number of [[children]] together, and making them jointly
pursue the same objects.

a child very soon contracts a benumbing indolence of [[mind]], which he
has seldom sufficient vigour to shake off, when he only asks a
question instead of seeking for information, and then relies
implicitly on the [[answer]] he receives.  with his equals [[equal]] in [[age]] this
could never be the case, and the subjects [[subject]] of inquiry, though they
might be influenced, would not be entirely under the direction of
men, who frequently damp, if not [[destroy]] abilities, by bringing
them forward too hastily:  and too hastily they will infallibly be
brought forward, if the child could be confined to the [[society]] of a
man, however sagacious that [[man]] may be.

besides, in [[youth]] the seeds of every affection should be sown, and
the respectful regard, which is [[felt]] for a parent, is very
different from the social affections that are to constitute the
happiness of [[life]] as it advances.  of these, equality is the basis,
and an intercourse of sentiments unclogged by that observant
seriousness which prevents disputation, though it may not inforce
submission.  let a child have ever such an affection for his
parent, he will always languish to play and chat with [[children]]; and
the very [[respect]] he entertains, for filial esteem always has a dash
of [[fear]] mixed with it, will, if it do not [[teach]] him cunning, at
least prevent him from pouring out the little secrets which first
open the [[heart]] to [[friendship]] and confidence, gradually leading to
more expansive benevolence.  added to this, he will never acquire
that frank ingenuousness of behaviour, which [[young]] [[people]] can only
attain by being frequently in [[society]], where they dare to speak
what they [[think]]; neither afraid of being reproved for their
presumption, nor laughed at for their folly.

forcibly impressed by the reflections which the sight of schools,
as they are at [[present]] conducted, naturally suggested, i have
formerly delivered my [[opinion]] rather warmly in favour of a private
education; but further [[experience]] has [[led]] me to view the [[subject]] in
a different [[light]].  i still, however, [[think]] schools, as they are
now regulated, the hot-beds of [[vice]] and folly, and the [[knowledge]] of
human [[nature]], supposed to be attained there, merely cunning
selfishness.

at school, boys become gluttons and slovens, and, instead of
cultivating domestic affections, very early rush into the
libertinism which destroys the [[constitution]] before it is formed;
hardening the [[heart]] as it weakens the understanding.

i should, in [[fact]], be averse to boarding-schools, if it were for no
other [[reason]] than the unsettled [[state]] of [[mind]] which the expectation
of the vacations [[produce]].  on these the children's thoughts [[thought]] are
fixed with eager anticipating hopes [[hope]], for, at least, to speak with
moderation, half of the [[time]], and when they arrive they are spent
in total dissipation and beastly indulgence.

but, on the contrary, when they are brought up at [[home]], though they
may pursue a plan of study in a more orderly manner than can be
adopted, when near a fourth part of the year is actually spent in
idleness, and as much more in regret and anticipation; yet they
there acquire too high an [[opinion]] of their own importance, from
being allowed to tyrannize over servants, and from the anxiety
expressed by most mothers [[mother]], on the score of manners, who, eager to
teach the accomplishments of a gentleman, stifle, in their birth,
the virtues [[virtue]] of a [[man]].  thus brought into company when they ought to
be seriously employed, and treated like [[men]] when they are still
boys, they become [[vain]] and effeminate.

the only way to avoid two extremes equally injurious to morality,
would be to contrive some way of combining a [[public]] and private
education.  thus to make [[men]] [[citizens]], two [[natural]] steps might be
taken, which seem directly to lead to the [[desired]] point; for the
domestic affections, that first open the [[heart]] to the various
modifications of [[humanity]] would be cultivated, whilst the children
were nevertheless allowed to spend [[great]] part of their [[time]], on
terms of equality, with other [[children]].

i still recollect, with [[pleasure]], the [[country]] day school; where a
boy trudged in the morning, wet or dry, carrying his books [[book]], and his
dinner, if it were at a considerable distance; a servant did not
then lead master by the hand, for, when he had once put on coat and
breeches, he was allowed to shift for himself, and return alone in
the evening to recount the feats of the day close at the parental
knee.  his father's house was his [[home]], and was ever after fondly
remembered; nay, i appeal to some superior [[men]] who were educated in
this manner, whether the recollection of some shady lane where they
conned their lesson; or, of some stile, where they sat making a
kite, or mending a bat, has not endeared their [[country]] to them?

but, what boy ever recollected with [[pleasure]] the years he spent in
close confinement, at an academy near [[london]]? unless indeed he
should by [[chance]] [[remember]] the [[poor]] scare-crow of an usher whom he
tormented; or, the tartman, from whom he caught a cake, to devour
it with the cattish appetite of selfishness.  at boarding schools
of every description, the relaxation of the junior boys is
mischief; and of the senior, [[vice]].  besides, in [[great]] schools what
can be more prejudicial to the [[moral]] [[character]], than the [[system]] of
tyranny and abject [[slavery]] which is established amongst the boys,
to say nothing of the [[slavery]] to forms, which makes [[religion]] worse
than a farce?  for what [[good]] can be expected from the [[youth]] who
receives the sacrament of the lord's supper, to avoid forfeiting
half-a-guinea, which he probably afterwards spends in some sensual
manner?  half the employment of the youths [[youth]] is to elude the
necessity of attending [[public]] [[worship]]; and well they may, for such
a constant repetition of the same thing must be a very irksome
restraint on their [[natural]] vivacity.  as these ceremonies [[ceremony]] have the
most fatal effect on their morals [[moral]], and as a ritual performed by the
lips, when the [[heart]] and [[mind]] are far away, is not now stored up by
our [[church]] as a bank to draw on for the fees of the [[poor]] souls [[soul]] in
purgatory, why should they not be abolished?

but the [[fear]] of innovation, in this [[country]], extends to every
thing.  this is only a covert [[fear]], the apprehensive timidity of
indolent slugs, who guard, by sliming it over, the snug place,
which they consider in the [[light]] of an hereditary estate; and [[eat]],
drink, and enjoy themselves, instead of fulfilling the duties [[duty]],
excepting a few empty forms, for which it was endowed.  these are
the [[people]] who most strenuously insist on the will of the founder
being observed, crying out against all reformation, as if it were a
violation of [[justice]].  i am now alluding particularly to the
relicks of popery retained in our colleges, where the protestant
members seem to be such sticklers for the established [[church]]; but
their zeal never makes them lose sight of the spoil of ignorance,
which rapacious priests [[priest]] of [[superstitious]] memory have scraped
together.  no, [[wise]] in their [[generation]], they venerate the
prescriptive [[right]] of possession, as a [[strong]] hold, and still let
the sluggish bell tingle to prayers, as during the days, when the
elevation of the host was supposed to atone for the sins [[sin]] of the
people, lest one reformation should lead to another, and the spirit
kill the letter.  these romish customs have the most baneful effect
on the morals [[moral]] of our clergy; for the idle vermin who two or three
times a day perform, in the most slovenly manner a service which
they [[think]] useless, but call their [[duty]], soon lose a sense of [[duty]].
at college, forced to attend or evade [[public]] [[worship]], they acquire
an habitual contempt for the very service, the performance of which
is to enable them to [[live]] in idleness.  it is mumbled over as an
affair of [[business]], as a stupid boy repeats his task, and
frequently the college cant escapes from the preacher the moment
after he has left the pulpit, and even whilst he is eating the
dinner which he earned in such a dishonest manner.

nothing, indeed, can be more irreverent than the cathedral service
as it is now performed in this [[country]], neither does it contain a
set of weaker [[men]] than those who are the slaves [[slave]] of this childish
routine.  a disgusting skeleton of the former [[state]] is still
exhibited; but all the solemnity, that interested the [[imagination]],
if it did not purify the [[heart]], is stripped off.  the performance
of high mass on the continent must impress every [[mind]], where a
spark of fancy glows, with that awful melancholy, that sublime
tenderness, so near a-kin to devotion.  i do not say, that these
devotional feelings are of more use, in a [[moral]] sense, than any
other emotion of taste; but i contend, that the theatrical pomp
which gratifies our senses, is to be preferred to the cold parade
that insults the understanding without reaching the [[heart]].

amongst remarks on national [[education]], such observations cannot be
misplaced, especially as the supporters of these establishments,
degenerated into puerilities, affect to be the champions of
religion.  [[religion]], pure source of comfort in this vale of tears!
how has thy clear stream been muddied by the dabblers, who have
presumptuously endeavoured to confine in one narrow channel, the
living waters that ever flow toward god-- the sublime ocean of
existence!  what would [[life]] be without that [[peace]] which the [[love]] of
god, when built on [[humanity]], alone can impart?  every earthly
affection turns back, at intervals, to prey upon the [[heart]] that
feeds it; and the purest effusions of benevolence, often rudely
damped by [[men]], must mount as a free-will offering to him who gave
them birth, whose bright image they faintly reflect.

in [[public]] schools, however, [[religion]], confounded with irksome
ceremonies and unreasonable restraints, assumes the most ungracious
aspect:  not the sober austere one that commands [[respect]] whilst it
inspires [[fear]]; but a ludicrous cast, that serves to point a pun.
for, in [[fact]], most of the [[good]] stories and smart things which
enliven the spirits that have been concentrated at whist, are
manufactured out of the incidents to which the very [[men]] [[labour]] to
give a droll turn who countenance the [[abuse]] to [[live]] on the spoil.

there is not, perhaps, in the [[kingdom]], a more dogmatical or
luxurious set of [[men]], than the pedantic tyrants [[tyrant]] who reside in
colleges and preside at [[public]] schools.  the vacations are equally
injurious to the morals [[moral]] of the masters and pupils, and the
intercourse, which the former keep up with the nobility, introduces
the same vanity and extravagance into their families [[family]], which banish
domestic duties [[duty]] and comforts from the lordly mansion, whose state
is awkwardly aped on a smaller scale.  the boys, who [[live]] at a
great expence with the masters and assistants, are never
domesticated, though placed there for that [[purpose]]; for, after a
silent dinner, they swallow a hasty glass of wine, and retire to
plan some mischievous trick, or to ridicule the [[person]] or manners
of the very [[people]] they have just been cringing to, and whom they
ought to consider as the representatives of their parents.

can it then be a matter of surprise, that boys become selfish and
vicious who are thus shut out from social converse? or that a mitre
often graces the brow of one of these diligent [[pastors]]? the desire
of living in the same style, as the rank just above them, infects
each [[individual]] and every class of [[people]], and meanness is the
concomitant of this ignoble [[ambition]]; but those professions are
most debasing whose ladder is patronage; yet out of one of these
professions the tutors of [[youth]] are in general chosen.  but, can
they be expected to inspire independent sentiments, whose conduct
must be regulated by the cautious prudence that is ever on the
watch for preferment?

so far, however, from thinking of the morals [[moral]] of boys, i have heard
several masters of schools argue, that they only undertook to teach
latin and [[greek]]; and that they had fulfilled their [[duty]], by sending
some [[good]] scholars to college.

a few [[good]] scholars, i grant, may have been formed by emulation and
discipline; but, to bring forward these clever boys, the health and
morals of a number have been sacrificed.

the sons [[son]] of our gentry and wealthy commoners are mostly educated at
these seminaries, and will any one pretend to assert, that the
majority, making every allowance, come under the description of
tolerable scholars?

it is not for the benefit of [[society]] that a few brilliant men
should be brought forward at the expence of the multitude.  it is
true, that [[great]] [[men]] seem to start up, as [[great]] revolutions [[revolution]] occur,
at proper intervals, to restore order, and to blow aside the clouds
that thicken over the face of [[truth]]; but let more [[reason]] and virtue
prevail in [[society]], and these [[strong]] winds would not be necessary.
public [[education]], of every denomination, should be directed to form
citizens; but if you [[wish]] to make [[good]] [[citizens]], you must first
exercise the affections of a [[son]] and a [[brother]].  this is the only
way to expand the [[heart]]; for [[public]] affections, as well as public
virtues, must ever grow out of the private [[character]], or they are
merely meteors that shoot athwart a dark [[sky]], and disappear as they
are gazed at and admired.

few, i [[believe]], have had much affection for [[mankind]], who did not
first [[love]] their parents, their brothers [[brother]], sisters, and even the
domestic brutes, whom they first played with.  the exercise of
youthful sympathies forms the [[moral]] temperature; and it is the
recollection of these first affections and pursuits, that gives
life to those that are afterwards more under the direction of
reason.  in [[youth]], the fondest friendships [[friendship]] are formed, the genial
juices mounting at the same [[time]], kindly mix; or, rather the [[heart]],
tempered for the reception of [[friendship]], is accustomed to seek for
pleasure in something more [[noble]] than the churlish gratification of
appetite.

in order then to inspire a [[love]] of [[home]] and domestic pleasures [[pleasure]],
children ought to be educated at [[home]], for riotous holidays only
make them fond of [[home]] for their own sakes.  yet, the vacations,
which do not foster domestic affections, continually disturb the
course of study, and render any plan of improvement abortive which
includes temperance; still, were they abolished, [[children]] would be
entirely separated from their parents, and i [[question]] whether they
would become [[better]] [[citizens]] by sacrificing the preparatory
affections, by destroying the [[force]] of relationships that render
the [[marriage]] [[state]] as necessary as respectable.  but, if a private
education [[produce]] self-importance, or insulates a [[man]] in his
family, the [[evil]] is only shifted, not remedied.

this train of reasoning brings me back to a [[subject]], on which i
mean to dwell, the necessity of establishing proper day-schools.

but these should be national establishments, for whilst
school-masters are dependent on the caprice of parents, little
exertion can be expected from them, more than is necessary to
please ignorant [[people]].  indeed, the necessity of a master's giving
the parents some sample of the boy's abilities, which during the
vacation, is shown to every visiter, is productive of more mischief
than would at first be supposed.  for they are seldom done
entirely, to speak with moderation, by the child itself; thus the
master countenances falsehoods, or winds the [[poor]] machine up to
some extraordinary exertion, that injures the wheels, and stops the
progress of gradual improvement.  the memory is loaded with
unintelligible words, to make a show of, without the
understanding's acquiring any distinct ideas [[idea]]: but only that
education deserves emphatically to be termed cultivation of [[mind]],
which teaches [[teach]] [[young]] [[people]] how to begin to [[think]].  the imagination
should not be allowed to debauch the understanding before it gained
strength, or vanity will become the forerunner of [[vice]]:  for every
way of exhibiting the acquirements of a child is injurious to its
moral [[character]].

how much [[time]] is lost in teaching them to recite what they do not
understand! whilst, seated on benches, all in their [[best]] array, the
mammas listen with astonishment to the parrot-like prattle, uttered
in solemn cadences, with all the pomp of ignorance and folly.  such
exhibitions only serve to strike the spreading fibres of vanity
through the whole [[mind]]; for they neither [[teach]] [[children]] to speak
fluently, nor behave gracefully.  so far from it, that these
frivolous pursuits might comprehensively be termed the study of
affectation: for we now rarely see a simple, bashful boy, though
few [[people]] of taste were ever disgusted by that awkward
sheepishness so [[natural]] to the [[age]], which schools and an early
introduction into [[society]], have changed into impudence and apish
grimace.

yet, how can these things be remedied whilst schoolmasters depend
entirely on parents for a subsistence; and when so many rival
schools hang out their lures to catch the attention of [[vain]] fathers
and mothers [[mother]], whose parental affection only leads them to [[wish]], that
their [[children]] should outshine those of their neighbours?

without [[great]] [[good]] [[luck]], a sensible, conscientious [[man]], would
starve before he could raise a school, if he disdained to bubble
weak parents, by practising the secret tricks of the craft.

in the [[best]] regulated schools, however, where swarms are not
crammed together many [[bad]] habits must be acquired; but, at common
schools, the [[body]], [[heart]], and understanding, are equally stunted,
for parents are often only in quest of the cheapest school, and the
master could not [[live]], if he did not take a much greater number
than he could manage himself; nor will the scanty pittance, allowed
for each child, permit him to hire ushers sufficient to assist in
the discharge of the mechanical part of the [[business]].  besides,
whatever appearance the house and garden may make, the [[children]] do
not enjoy the comforts of either, for they are continually
reminded, by irksome restrictions, that they are not at [[home]], and
the state-rooms, garden, etc. must be kept in order for the
recreation of the parents; who, of a sunday, visit the school, and
are impressed by the very parade that renders the situation of
their [[children]] uncomfortable.

with what disgust have i heard sensible [[women]], for girls are more
restrained and cowed than boys, speak of the wearisome confinement
which they endured at school.  not allowed, perhaps, to step out of
one broad walk in a superb garden, and obliged to pace with steady
deportment stupidly backwards and forwards, holding up their heads,
and turning out their toes, with shoulders braced back, instead of
bounding, as [[nature]] directs to complete her own design, in the
various attitudes so conducive to health.  the pure animal spirits,
which make both [[mind]] and [[body]] shoot out, and unfold the tender
blossoms of [[hope]] are turned sour, and vented in [[vain]] wishes [[wish]], or
pert repinings, that contract the faculties and spoil the temper;
else they mount to the brain and sharpening the understanding
before it gains proportionable [[strength]], [[produce]] that pitiful
cunning which disgracefully characterizes the female mind--and i
fear will ever characterize it whilst [[women]] remain the slaves [[slave]] of
power!

the little [[respect]] which the male [[world]] [[pay]] to chastity is, i am
persuaded, the grand source of many of the physical and [[moral]] evils
that torment [[mankind]], as well as of the vices [[vice]] and follies that
degrade and [[destroy]] [[women]]; yet at school, boys infallibly lose that
decent bashfulness, which might have ripened into modesty at [[home]].

i have already animadverted on the [[bad]] habits which females acquire
when they are shut up together; and i [[think]] that the observation
may fairly be extended to the other [[sex]], till the [[natural]] inference
is drawn which i have had in view throughout--that to improve both
sexes they ought, not only in private families [[family]], but in public
schools, to be educated together.  if [[marriage]] be the cement of
society, [[mankind]] should all be educated after the same model, or
the intercourse of the sexes [[sex]] will never deserve the name of
fellowship, nor will [[women]] ever fulfil the peculiar duties [[duty]] of their
sex, till they become enlightened [[citizens]], till they become [[free]],
by being enabled to earn their own subsistence, independent of [[men]];
in the same manner, i mean, to prevent misconstruction, as one man
is independent of another.  nay, [[marriage]] will never be held sacred
till [[women]] by being brought up with [[men]], are prepared to be their
companions, rather than their mistresses; for the mean doublings of
cunning will ever render them contemptible, whilst oppression
renders them timid.  so convinced am i of this [[truth]], that i will
venture to predict, that [[virtue]] will never prevail in [[society]] till
the virtues [[virtue]] of both sexes [[sex]] are founded on [[reason]]; and, till the
affection [[common]] to both are allowed to gain their due [[strength]] by
the discharge of mutual duties [[duty]].

were boys and girls permitted to pursue the same studies together,
those graceful decencies might early be inculcated which produce
modesty, without those [[sexual]] distinctions that taint the [[mind]].
lessons of politeness, and that formulary of decorum, which treads
on the heels of falsehood, would be rendered useless by habitual
propriety of behaviour.  not, indeed put on for visiters like the
courtly robe of politeness, but the sober effect of cleanliness of
mind.  would not this simple elegance of sincerity be a chaste
homage paid to domestic affections, far surpassing the meretricious
compliments that shine with false lustre in the heartless
intercourse of fashionable [[life]]?  but, till more understanding
preponderate in [[society]], there will ever be a want of [[heart]] and
taste, and the harlot's rouge will supply the place of that
celestial suffusion which only [[virtuous]] affections can give to the
face.  gallantry, and what is called [[love]], may subsist without
simplicity of [[character]]; but the main pillars of [[friendship]], are
respect and confidence--esteem is never founded on it cannot tell
what.

a taste for the fine [[arts]] requires [[great]] cultivation; but not more
than a taste for the [[virtuous]] affections:  and both suppose that
enlargement of [[mind]] which opens so many sources of mental [[pleasure]].
why do [[people]] hurry to noisy scenes and crowded circles?  i should
answer, because they want activity of [[mind]], because they have not
cherished the virtues [[virtue]] of the [[heart]].  they only, therefore, see and
feel in the gross, and continually pine after variety, finding
every thing that is simple, insipid.

this argument may be carried further than [[philosophers]] are aware
of, for if [[nature]] destined woman, in particular, for the discharge
of domestic duties [[duty]], she made her susceptible of the attached
affections in a [[great]] [[degree]].  now [[women]] are notoriously fond of
pleasure; and naturally must be so, according to my definition,
because they cannot enter into the minutiae of domestic taste;
lacking [[judgment]] the foundation of all taste.  for the
understanding, in spite of sensual cavillers, reserves to itself
the [[privilege]] of conveying pure joy to the [[heart]].

with what a languid yawn have i seen an admirable poem thrown down,
that a [[man]] of true taste returns to, again and again with rapture;
and, whilst melody has almost suspended respiration, a [[lady]] has
asked me where i bought my gown.  i have seen also an eye glanced
coldly over a most exquisite picture, rest, sparkling with
pleasure, on a caricature rudely sketched; and whilst some terrific
feature in [[nature]] has spread a sublime stillness through my [[soul]], i
have been [[desired]] to observe the pretty tricks of a lap-dog, that
my perverse [[fate]] forced me to travel with.  is it surprising, that
such a tasteless being should rather caress this dog than her
children?  or, that she should prefer the rant of [[flattery]] to the
simple accents of sincerity?

to illustrate this remark i must be allowed to observe, that [[men]] of
the first genius, and most cultivated minds [[mind]], have appeared to have
the highest relish for the simple beauties [[beauty]] of [[nature]]; and they must
have forcibly [[felt]], what they have so well described, the charm,
which [[natural]] affections, and unsophisticated feelings spread round
the [[human]] [[character]].  it is this [[power]] of looking into the [[heart]],
and responsively vibrating with each emotion, that enables the poet
to personify each passion, and the painter to sketch with a pencil
of [[fire]].

true taste is ever the [[work]] of the understanding employed in
observing [[natural]] effects; and till [[women]] have more understanding,
it is [[vain]] to expect them to possess domestic taste.  their lively
senses will ever be at [[work]] to harden their hearts [[heart]], and the
emotions struck out of them will continue to be vivid and
transitory, unless a proper [[education]] stores their minds [[mind]] with
knowledge.

it is the want of domestic taste, and not the acquirement of
knowledge, that takes [[women]] out of their families [[family]], and tears the
smiling babe from the breast that ought to afford it nourishment.
women have been allowed to remain in ignorance, and slavish
dependence, many, very many years, and still we hear of nothing but
their fondness of [[pleasure]] and sway, their preference of rakes and
soldiers, their childish attachment to toys, and the vanity that
makes them value accomplishments more than virtues [[virtue]].

history brings forward a fearful catalogue of the crimes which
their cunning has produced, when the [[weak]] slaves [[slave]] have had
sufficient address to over-reach their masters.  in [[france]], and in
how many other countries [[country]] have [[men]] been the luxurious despots, and
women the crafty ministers?  does this prove that ignorance and
dependence domesticate them?  is not their folly the by-word of the
libertines, who relax in their [[society]]; and do not [[men]] of sense
continually lament, that an immoderate fondness for dress and
dissipation carries the [[mother]] of a [[family]] for ever from [[home]]?
their hearts [[heart]] have not been debauched by [[knowledge]], nor their minds
led astray by scientific pursuits; yet, they do not fulfil the
peculiar duties [[duty]], which as [[women]] they are called upon by [[nature]] to
fulfil.  on the contrary, the [[state]] of warfare which subsists
between the sexes [[sex]], makes them employ those wiles, that frustrate
the more open designs of [[force]].

when, therefore, i call [[women]] slaves [[slave]], i mean in a [[political]] and
civil sense; for, indirectly they obtain too much [[power]], and are
debased by their exertions to obtain illicit sway.

let an enlightened nation then try what effect [[reason]] would have to
bring them back to [[nature]], and their [[duty]]; and allowing them to
share the advantages of [[education]] and [[government]] with [[man]], see
whether they will become [[better]], as they grow wiser and become
free.  they cannot be injured by the experiment; for it is not in
the [[power]] of [[man]] to render them more insignificant than they are at
present.

to render this practicable, day schools for particular ages [[age]] should
be established by [[government]], in which boys and girls might be
educated together.  the school for the younger [[children]], from five
to nine years of [[age]], ought to be absolutely [[free]] and open to all
classes.*  a sufficient number of masters should also be chosen by
a select committee, in each parish, to whom any complaint of
negligence, etc. might be made, if signed by six of the children's
parents.

(*footnote.  treating this part of the [[subject]], i have borrowed
some hints from a very sensible pamphlet written by the late bishop
of autun on [[public]] [[education]].)

ushers would then be unnecessary; for, i [[believe]], [[experience]] will
ever prove, that this [[kind]] of subordinate [[authority]] is particularly
injurious to the morals [[moral]] of [[youth]].  what, indeed, can tend to
deprave the [[character]] more than outward submission and inward
contempt?  yet, how can boys be expected to treat an usher with
respect when the master seems to consider him in the [[light]] of a
servant, and almost to countenance the ridicule which becomes the
chief amusement of the boys during the play hours?

but nothing of this [[kind]] could occur in an elementary day-school,
where boys and girls, the [[rich]] and [[poor]], should meet together.  and
to prevent any of the distinctions of vanity, they should be
dressed alike, and all obliged to submit to the same discipline, or
leave the school.  the school-room ought to be surrounded by a
large piece of ground, in which the [[children]] might be usefully
exercised, for at this [[age]] they should not be confined to any
sedentary employment for more than an hour at a [[time]].  but these
relaxations might all be rendered a part of elementary [[education]],
for many things improve and amuse the senses, when introduced as a
kind of show, to the principles [[principle]] of which dryly laid down, children
would turn a deaf ear.  for instance, botany, mechanics, and
astronomy.  reading, writing, arithmetic, [[natural]] [[history]], and some
simple experiments in [[natural]] [[philosophy]], might fill up the day;
but these pursuits should never encroach on gymnastic plays in the
open air.  the elements of [[religion]], [[history]], the [[history]] of [[man]],
and [[politics]], might also be taught by conversations, in the
socratic form.

after the [[age]] of nine, girls and boys, intended for domestic
employments, or mechanical trades [[trade]], ought to be removed to other
schools, and receive instruction, in some measure appropriated to
the destination of each [[individual]], the two sexes [[sex]] being still
together in the morning; but in the afternoon, the girls should
attend a school, where plain [[work]], mantua-making, millinery, etc.
would be their employment.

the [[young]] [[people]] of superior abilities, or [[fortune]], might now be
taught, in another school, the [[dead]] and living languages [[language]], the
elements of [[science]], and continue the study of [[history]] and
politics, on a more extensive scale, which would not exclude polite
literature.  girls and boys still together? i hear some readers
ask:  yes.  and i should not [[fear]] any other consequence, than that
some early attachment might take place; which, whilst it had the
best effect on the [[moral]] [[character]] of the [[young]] [[people]], might not
perfectly agree with the views of the parents, for it will be a
long [[time]], i [[fear]], before the [[world]] is so enlightened, that
parents, only anxious to render their [[children]] [[virtuous]], will let
them choose companions for [[life]] themselves.

besides, this would be a sure way to promote early marriages [[marriage]], and
from early marriages [[marriage]] the most salutary physical and [[moral]] effects
naturally flow.  what a different [[character]] does a [[married]] citizen
assume from the selfish coxcomb, who lives [[life]] but for himself, and who
is often afraid to [[marry]] lest he should not be able to [[live]] in a
certain style.  [[great]] emergencies excepted, which would rarely
occur in a [[society]] of which equality was the basis, a [[man]] could
only be prepared to discharge the duties [[duty]] of [[public]] [[life]], by the
habitual practice of those inferior ones which form the [[man]].

in this plan of [[education]], the [[constitution]] of boys would not be
ruined by the early debaucheries, which now make [[men]] so selfish,
nor girls rendered [[weak]] and [[vain]], by indolence and frivolous
pursuits.  but, i presuppose, that such a [[degree]] of equality should
be established between the sexes [[sex]] as would shut out gallantry and
coquetry, yet allow [[friendship]] and [[love]] to temper the [[heart]] for the
discharge of higher duties [[duty]].

these would be schools of morality--and the [[happiness]] of [[man]],
allowed to flow from the pure springs of [[duty]] and affection, what
advances might not the [[human]] [[mind]] make?  [[society]] can only be happy
and [[free]] in proportion as it is [[virtuous]]; but the present
distinctions, established in [[society]], corrode all private, and
blast all [[public]] [[virtue]].

i have already inveighed against the custom of confining girls to
their needle, and shutting them out from all [[political]] and civil
employments; for by thus narrowing their minds [[mind]] they are rendered
unfit to fulfil the peculiar duties [[duty]] which [[nature]] has assigned them.

only employed about the little incidents of the day, they
necessarily grow up cunning.  my very [[soul]] has often sickened at
observing the sly tricks practised by [[women]] to gain some foolish
thing on which their silly hearts [[heart]] were set.  not allowed to dispose
of [[money]], or call any thing their own, they learn to turn the
market penny; or, should a husband offend, by staying from [[home]], or
give rise to some emotions of jealousy--a new gown, or any pretty
bauble, smooths juno's angry brow.

but these littlenesses would not degrade their [[character]], if women
were [[led]] to [[respect]] themselves, if [[political]] and [[moral]] subjects
were opened to them; and i will venture to affirm, that this is the
only way to make them properly attentive to their domestic duties [[duty]].
an active [[mind]] embraces the whole circle of its duties [[duty]], and finds
time enough for all.  it is not, i assert, a bold attempt to
emulate masculine virtues [[virtue]]; it is not the enchantment of literary
pursuits, or the steady investigation of scientific subjects [[subject]], that
lead [[women]] astray from [[duty]].  no, it is indolence and vanity --the
love of [[pleasure]] and the [[love]] of sway, that will reign paramount in
an empty [[mind]].  i say empty, emphatically, because the education
which [[women]] now receive scarcely deserves the name.  for the little
knowledge they are [[led]] to acquire during the important years of
youth, is merely relative to accomplishments; and accomplishments
without a bottom, for unless the understanding be cultivated,
superficial and monotonous is every grace.  like the charms of a
made-up face, they only strike the senses in a crowd; but at [[home]],
wanting [[mind]], they want variety.  the consequence is obvious; in
gay scenes of dissipation we meet the artificial [[mind]] and face, for
those who fly from solitude dread next to solitude, the domestic
circle; not having it in their [[power]] to amuse or interest, they
feel their own insignificance, or find nothing to amuse or interest
themselves.

besides, what can be more indelicate than a girl's coming out in
the fashionable [[world]]?  which, in other words, is to bring to
market a marriageable miss, whose [[person]] is taken from one public
place to another, richly caparisoned.  yet, mixing in the giddy
circle under restraint, these butterflies long to flutter at large,
for the first affection of their souls [[soul]] is their own persons [[person]], to
which their attention has been called with the most sedulous [[care]],
whilst they were preparing for the period that decides their fate
for [[life]].  instead of pursuing this idle routine, sighing for
tasteless show, and heartless [[state]], with what [[dignity]] would the
youths of both sexes [[sex]] form attachments in the schools that i have
cursorily pointed out; in which, as [[life]] advanced, dancing, [[music]],
and drawing, might be admitted as relaxations, for at these schools
young [[people]] of [[fortune]] ought to remain, more or less, till they
were of [[age]].  those, who were designed for particular professions,
might attend, three or four mornings in the week, the schools
appropriated for their immediate instruction.

i only drop these observations at [[present]], as hints; rather, indeed
as an outline of the plan i mean, than a digested one; but i must
add, that i highly approve of one regulation mentioned in the
pamphlet already alluded to (the bishop of autun), that of making
the [[children]] and youths [[youth]] independent of the masters respecting
punishments.  they should be tried by their peers, which would be
an admirable method of fixing sound principles [[principle]] of [[justice]] in the
mind, and might have the happiest effect on the temper, which is
very early soured or irritated by [[tyranny]], till it becomes
peevishly cunning, or ferociously overbearing.

my [[imagination]] darts forward with benevolent fervour to greet these
amiable and respectable groups, in spite of the sneering of cold
hearts, who are at [[liberty]] to utter, with frigid self-importance,
the damning epithet-- romantic; the [[force]] of which i shall
endeavour to blunt by repeating the words of an eloquent moralist.
"i [[know]] not whether the allusions of a truly humane [[heart]], whose
zeal renders every thing easy, is not preferable to that rough and
repulsing [[reason]], which always finds in indifference for the public
good, the first obstacle to whatever would promote it."

i [[know]] that libertines will also exclaim, that woman would be
unsexed by acquiring [[strength]] of [[body]] and [[mind]], and that [[beauty]],
soft bewitching beauty! would no longer adorn the daughters [[daughter]] of [[men]].
i am of a very different [[opinion]], for i [[think]], that, on the
contrary, we should then see dignified [[beauty]], and true grace; to
produce which, many powerful physical and [[moral]] causes would
concur.  not relaxed [[beauty]], it is true, nor the graces of
helplessness; but such as appears to make us [[respect]] the [[human]] body
as a majestic pile, fit to receive a [[noble]] inhabitant, in the
relics of antiquity.

i do not forget the popular [[opinion]], that the grecian statues were
not modelled after [[nature]].  i mean, not according to the
proportions of a particular [[man]]; but that beautiful limbs and
features were selected from various bodies [[body]] to form an harmonious
whole.  this might, in some [[degree]], be true.  the fine ideal
picture of an exalted [[imagination]] might be superior to the
materials which the painter found in [[nature]], and thus it might with
propriety be termed rather the model of [[mankind]] than of a [[man]].  it
was not, however, the mechanical selection of limbs and features,
but the ebullition of an heated fancy that burst forth; and the
fine senses and enlarged understanding of the artist selected the
solid matter, which he drew into this glowing focus.

i observed that it was not mechanical, because a whole was
produced--a model of that grand simplicity, of those concurring
energies, which arrest our attention and command our reverence.
for only insipid lifeless [[beauty]] is produced by a servile copy of
even beautiful [[nature]].  yet, independent of these observations, i
believe, that the [[human]] form must have been far more beautiful than
it is at [[present]], because extreme indolence, barbarous ligatures,
and many causes, which forcibly act on it, in our luxurious state
of [[society]], did not retard its expansion, or render it deformed.
exercise and cleanliness appear to be not only the surest means of
preserving health, but of promoting [[beauty]], the physical causes
only considered; yet, this is not sufficient, [[moral]] ones must
concur, or [[beauty]] will be merely of that rustic [[kind]] which blooms
on the [[innocent]], wholesome countenances of some [[country]] [[people]],
whose minds [[mind]] have not been exercised.  to render the [[person]] [[perfect]],
physical and [[moral]] [[beauty]] ought to be attained at the same [[time]];
each lending and receiving [[force]] by the combination.  [[judgment]] must
reside on the brow, affection and fancy beam in the eye, and
humanity curve the cheek, or [[vain]] is the sparkling of the finest
eye or the elegantly turned finish of the fairest features;  whilst
in every motion that displays the active limbs and well-knit
joints, grace and modesty should appear.  but this [[fair]] assemblage
is not to be brought together by [[chance]]; it is the [[reward]] of
exertions met to support each other; for [[judgment]] can only be
acquired by reflection, affection, by the discharge of duties [[duty]], and
humanity by the exercise of compassion to every living creature.

humanity to animals should be particularly inculcated as a part of
national [[education]], for it is not at [[present]] one of our national
virtues.  tenderness for their humble dumb domestics, amongst the
lower class, is oftener to be found in a savage than a civilized
state.  for [[civilization]] prevents that intercourse which creates
affection in the rude hut, or mud cabin, and leads uncultivated
minds who are only depraved by the refinements which prevail in the
society, where they are trodden under foot by the [[rich]], to domineer
over them to [[revenge]] the insults that they are obliged to bear from
their superiours.

this habitual [[cruelty]] is first caught at school, where it is one of
the rare sports [[sport]] of the boys to torment the miserable brutes that
fall in their way.  the transition, as they grow up, from barbarity
to brutes to domestic [[tyranny]] over wives [[wife]], [[children]], and servants,
is very easy.  [[justice]], or even benevolence, will not be a powerful
spring of action, unless it extend to the whole creation; nay, i
believe that it may be delivered as an axiom, that those who can
see [[pain]], unmoved, will soon learn to inflict it.

the vulgar are swayed by [[present]] feelings, and the habits which
they have accidentally acquired; but on partial feelings much
dependence cannot be placed, though they be just; for, when they
are not invigorated by reflection, custom weakens them, till they
are scarcely [[felt]].  the sympathies of our [[nature]] are strengthened
by pondering cogitations, and deadened by thoughtless use.
macbeth's [[heart]] smote him more for one murder, the first, than for
a hundred subsequent ones, which were necessary to back it.  but,
when i used the epithet vulgar, i did not mean to confine my remark
to the [[poor]], for partial [[humanity]], founded on [[present]] sensations or
whim, is quite as conspicuous, if not more so, amongst the [[rich]].

the [[lady]] who sheds tears for the bird starved in a snare, and
execrates the devils [[devil]] in the shape of [[men]], who goad to madness the
poor ox, or whip the patient ass, tottering under a burden above
its [[strength]], will, nevertheless, keep her coachman and horses
whole hours waiting for her, when the sharp frost bites, or the
rain beats against the well-closed windows which do not admit a
breath of air to tell her how roughly the wind blows without.  and
she who takes her dogs to bed, and nurses them with a parade of
sensibility, when sick, will suffer her babes to grow up crooked in
a nursery.  this illustration of my argument is drawn from a matter
of [[fact]].  the woman whom i allude to was handsome, reckoned very
handsome, by those who do not miss the [[mind]] when the face is plump
and [[fair]]; but her understanding had not been [[led]] from female duties
by literature, nor her innocence debauched by [[knowledge]].  no, she
was quite feminine, according to the masculine acceptation of the
word; and, so far from loving these spoiled brutes that filled the
place which her [[children]] ought to have occupied, she only lisped
out a pretty mixture of french and english nonsense, to please the
men who flocked round her.  the [[wife]], [[mother]], and [[human]] creature,
were all swallowed up by the factitious [[character]], which an
improper [[education]], and the selfish vanity of [[beauty]], had produced.

i do not like to make a distinction without a difference, and i own
that i have been as much disgusted by the fine [[lady]] who took her
lap-dog to her bosom, instead of her child; as by the ferocity of a
man, who, beating his horse, declared, that he knew as well when he
did [[wrong]] as a [[christian]].

this brood of folly shows how mistaken they are who, if they allow
women to leave their harams, do not cultivate their understanding,
in order to plant virtues [[virtue]] in their hearts [[heart]].  for had they sense,
they might acquire that domestic taste which would lead them to
love with reasonable subordination their whole [[family]], from the
husband to the house-dog; nor would they ever insult [[humanity]] in
the [[person]] of the most menial servant, by paying more attention to
the comfort of a brute, than to that of a fellow-creature.

my observations on national [[education]] are obviously hints; but i
principally [[wish]] to enforce the necessity of educating the sexes
together to [[perfect]] both, and of making [[children]] sleep at [[home]],
that they may learn to [[love]] [[home]]; yet to make private support
instead of smothering [[public]] affections, they should be sent to
school to mix with a number of equals [[equal]], for only by the jostlings of
equality can we form a just [[opinion]] of ourselves.

to render [[mankind]] more [[virtuous]], and happier of course, both sexes
must act from the same [[principle]]; but how can that be expected when
only one is allowed to see the reasonableness of it?  to render
also the social compact truly equitable, and in order to spread
those enlightening principles [[principle]], which alone can meliorate the fate
of [[man]], [[women]] must be allowed to found their [[virtue]] on [[knowledge]],
which is scarcely possible unless they be educated by the same
pursuits as [[men]].  for they are now made so inferiour by ignorance
and low desires [[desire]], as not to deserve to be ranked with them; or, by
the serpentine wrigglings of cunning they mount the tree of
knowledge and only acquire sufficient to lead [[men]] astray.

it is plain from the [[history]] of all nations, that [[women]] cannot be
confined to merely domestic pursuits, for they will not fulfil
family duties [[duty]], unless their minds [[mind]] take a wider range, and whilst
they are kept in ignorance, they become in the same proportion, the
slaves of [[pleasure]] as they are the slaves [[slave]] of [[man]].  nor can they be
shut out of [[great]] enterprises, though the narrowness of their minds
often make them mar what they are unable to comprehend.

the libertinism, and even the virtues [[virtue]] of superior [[men]], will always
give [[women]], of some description, [[great]] [[power]] over them; and these
weak [[women]], under the influence of childish [[passions]] and selfish
vanity, will throw a false [[light]] over the objects which the very
men view with their [[eyes]], who ought to enlighten their [[judgment]].
men of fancy, and those sanguine characters [[character]] who mostly hold the
helm of [[human]] affairs, in general, relax in the [[society]] of [[women]];
and surely i need not cite to the most superficial reader of
history, the numerous examples [[example]] of [[vice]] and oppression which the
private intrigues of female favourites have produced; not to dwell
on the mischief that naturally arises from the blundering
interposition of well-meaning folly.  for in the transactions of
business it is much [[better]] to have to deal with a knave than a
fool, because a knave adheres to some plan; and any plan of reason
may be seen through much sooner than a sudden flight of folly.  the
power which vile and foolish [[women]] have had over [[wise]] [[men]], who
possessed sensibility, is notorious; i shall only mention one
instance.

whoever drew a more exalted female [[character]] than [[rousseau]]?  though
in the lump he constantly endeavoured to degrade the [[sex]].  and why
was he thus anxious?  truly to justify to himself the affection
which weakness and [[virtue]] had made him cherish for that fool
theresa.  he could not raise her to the [[common]] level of her [[sex]];
and therefore he laboured to bring woman down to her's.  he found
her a convenient humble companion, and [[pride]] made him determine to
find some superior virtues [[virtue]] in the being whom he chose to [[live]] with;
but did not her conduct during his [[life]], and after his [[death]],
clearly show how grossly he was mistaken who called her a celestial
innocent.  nay, in the bitterness of his [[heart]], he himself laments,
that when his bodily infirmities made him no longer treat her like
a woman, she ceased to have an affection for him.  and it was very
natural that she should, for having so few sentiments in [[common]],
when the [[sexual]] tie was broken, what was to hold her?  to hold her
affection whose sensibility was confined to one [[sex]], nay, to one
man, it requires sense to turn sensibility into the broad channel
of [[humanity]]: many [[women]] have not [[mind]] enough to have an affection
for a woman, or a [[friendship]] for a [[man]].  but the [[sexual]] weakness
that makes woman depend on [[man]] for a subsistence, produces [[produce]] a kind
of cattish affection, which leads a [[wife]] to purr about her husband,
as she would about any [[man]] who fed and caressed her.

men, are however, often gratified by this [[kind]] of fondness which is
confined in a beastly manner to themselves, but should they ever
become more [[virtuous]], they will [[wish]] to converse at their fire-side
with a friend, after they cease to play with a mistress.  besides,
understanding is necessary to give variety and interest to sensual
enjoyments, for low, indeed, in the intellectual scale, is the mind
that can continue to [[love]] when neither [[virtue]] nor sense give a
human appearance to an animal appetite.  but sense will always
preponderate; and if [[women]] are not, in general, brought more on a
level with [[men]], some superior [[women]], like the [[greek]] courtezans will
assemble the [[men]] of abilities around them, and draw from their
families many [[citizens]], who would have stayed at [[home]], had their
wives had more sense, or the graces which result from the exercise
of the understanding and fancy, the legitimate parents of taste.  a
woman of [[talents]], if she be not absolutely ugly, will always obtain
great [[power]], raised by the weakness of her [[sex]]; and in proportion
as [[men]] acquire [[virtue]] and delicacy: by the exertion of [[reason]], they
will look for both in [[women]], but they can only acquire them in the
same way that [[men]] do.

in [[france]] or [[italy]] have the [[women]] confined themselves to domestic
life? though they have not hitherto had a [[political]] existence, yet,
have they not illicitly had [[great]] sway? corrupting themselves and
the [[men]] with whose [[passions]] they played?  in short, in whatever
light i view the [[subject]], [[reason]] and [[experience]] convince me, that
the only method of leading [[women]] to fulfil their peculiar duties [[duty]],
is to [[free]] them from all restraint by allowing them to participate
the inherent rights [[right]] of [[mankind]].

make them [[free]], and they will quickly become [[wise]] and [[virtuous]], as
men become more so; for the improvement must be mutual, or the
justice which one half of the [[human]] [[race]] are obliged to submit to,
retorting on their oppressors, the [[virtue]] of [[man]] will be worm-eaten
by the insect whom he keeps under his feet.

let [[men]] take their [[choice]], [[man]] and woman were made for each other,
though not to become one being; and if they will not improve [[women]],
they will deprave them!

i speak of the improvement and emancipation of the whole [[sex]], for i
know that the behaviour of a few [[women]], who by accident, or
following a [[strong]] bent of [[nature]], have acquired a portion of
knowledge superior to that of the rest of their [[sex]], has often been
over-bearing; but there have been instances of [[women]] who, attaining
knowledge, have not discarded modesty, nor have they always
pedantically appeared to despise the ignorance which they laboured
to disperse in their own minds [[mind]].  the exclamations then which any
advice respecting female learning, commonly produces [[produce]], especially
from pretty [[women]], often arise from envy.  when they [[chance]] to see
that even the lustre of their [[eyes]], and the flippant sportiveness
of refined coquetry will not always secure them attention, during a
whole evening, should a woman of a more cultivated understanding
endeavour to give a [[rational]] turn to the conversation, the common
source of consolation is, that such [[women]] seldom get husbands.
what [[arts]] have i not seen silly [[women]] use to interrupt by
flirtation, (a very significant word to describe such a manoeuvre)
a [[rational]] conversation, which made the [[men]] forget that they were
pretty [[women]].

but, allowing what is very [[natural]] to man--that the possession of
rare abilities is really calculated to excite over-weening [[pride]],
disgusting in both [[men]] and women--in what a [[state]] of inferiority
must the female faculties have rusted when such a small portion of
knowledge as those [[women]] attained, who have sneeringly been termed
learned [[women]], could be singular? sufficiently so to puff up the
possessor, and excite envy in her contemporaries, and some of the
other [[sex]].  nay, has not a little rationality exposed many [[women]] to
the severest censure?  i advert to well known-facts, for i have
frequently heard [[women]] ridiculed, and every little weakness
exposed, only because they adopted the [[advice]] of some medical [[men]],
and deviated from the beaten track in their mode of treating their
infants.  i have actually heard this barbarous aversion to
innovation carried still further, and a sensible woman stigmatized
as an unnatural [[mother]], who has thus been wisely solicitous to
preserve the health of her [[children]], when in the midst of her care
she has lost one by some of the casualties of infancy which no
prudence can ward off.  her acquaintance have observed, that this
was the consequence of new-fangled notions--the new-fangled notions
of ease and cleanliness.  and those who, pretending to [[experience]],
though they have long adhered to prejudices that have, according to
the [[opinion]] of the most sagacious physicians, thinned the human
race, almost rejoiced at the disaster that gave a [[kind]] of sanction
to prescription.

indeed, if it were only on this account, the national [[education]] of
women is of the utmost consequence; for what a number of human
sacrifices are made to that moloch, prejudice!  and in how many
ways are [[children]] destroyed by the lasciviousness of [[man]]?  the want
of [[natural]] affection in many [[women]], who are drawn from their duty
by the admiration of [[men]], and the ignorance of others, render the
infancy of [[man]] a much more perilous [[state]] than that of brutes; yet
men are unwilling to place [[women]] in situations proper to enable
them to acquire sufficient understanding to [[know]] how even to nurse
their babes.

so forcibly does this [[truth]] strike me, that i would rest the whole
tendency of my reasoning upon it; for whatever tends to
incapacitate the maternal [[character]], takes woman out of her sphere.

but it is [[vain]] to expect the [[present]] [[race]] of [[weak]] mothers [[mother]] either to
take that reasonable [[care]] of a child's [[body]], which is necessary to
lay the foundation of a [[good]] [[constitution]], supposing that it do not
suffer for the sins [[sin]] of its fathers [[father]]; or to manage its temper so
judiciously that the child will not have, as it grows up, to throw
off all that its [[mother]], its first instructor, directly or
indirectly taught, and unless the [[mind]] have uncommon vigour,
womanish follies will stick to the [[character]] throughout [[life]].  the
weakness of the [[mother]] will be visited on the children!  and whilst
women are educated to rely on their husbands for [[judgment]], this
must ever be the consequence, for there is no improving an
understanding by halves, nor can any being act wisely from
imitation, because in every circumstance of [[life]] there is a [[kind]] of
individuality, which requires an exertion of [[judgment]] to modify
general rules [[rule]].  the being who can [[think]] justly in one track, will
soon extend its intellectual [[empire]]; and she who has sufficient
judgment to manage her [[children]], will not submit [[right]] or [[wrong]], to
her husband, or patiently to the social laws [[law]] which makes a
nonentity of a [[wife]].

in [[public]] schools [[women]], to guard against the errors of ignorance,
should be taught the elements of anatomy and medicine, not only to
enable them to take proper [[care]] of their own health, but to make
them [[rational]] nurses of their infants, parents, and husbands; for
the bills of [[mortality]] are swelled by the blunders of self-willed
old [[women]], who give nostrums of their own, without knowing any
thing of the [[human]] frame.  it is likewise proper, only in a
domestic view, to make [[women]], acquainted with the anatomy of the
mind, by allowing the sexes [[sex]] to associate together in every pursuit;
and by leading them to observe the [[progress]] of the human
understanding in the improvement of the sciences [[science]] and [[arts]]; never
forgetting the [[science]] of morality, nor the study of the political
history of [[mankind]].

a [[man]] has been termed a microcosm; and every [[family]] might also be
called a [[state]].  states, it is true, have mostly been governed by
arts that disgrace the [[character]] of [[man]]; and the want of a just
constitution, and [[equal]] laws [[law]], have so perplexed the notions of the
worldly [[wise]], that they more than [[question]] the reasonableness of
contending for the rights [[right]] of [[humanity]].  thus morality, polluted in
the national reservoir, sends off streams of [[vice]] to [[corrupt]] the
constituent parts of the [[body]] [[politic]]; but should more [[noble]], or
rather more just principles [[principle]] regulate the laws [[law]], which ought to be
the [[government]] of [[society]], and not those who execute them, duty
might become the [[rule]] of private conduct.

besides, by the exercise of their bodies [[body]] and minds [[mind]], [[women]] would
acquire that mental activity so necessary in the maternal
character, [[united]] with the fortitude that distinguishes steadiness
of conduct from the obstinate perverseness of weakness.  for it is
dangerous to advise the indolent to be steady, because they
instantly become rigorous, and to save themselves trouble, punish
with severity faults [[fault]] that the patient fortitude of [[reason]] might
have prevented.

but fortitude presupposes [[strength]] of [[mind]], and is [[strength]] of mind
to be acquired by indolent acquiescence?  by asking [[advice]] instead
of exerting the [[judgment]]?  by obeying through [[fear]], instead of
practising the forbearance, which we all stand in need of
ourselves?  the conclusion which i [[wish]] to draw is obvious; make
women [[rational]] creatures and [[free]] [[citizens]], and they will quickly
become [[good]] wives [[wife]], and mothers [[mother]]; that is--if [[men]] do not neglect the
duties of husbands and fathers [[father]].

discussing the advantages which a [[public]] and private education
combined, as i have sketched, might rationally be expected to
produce, i have dwelt most on such as are particularly relative to
the female [[world]], because i [[think]] the female [[world]] [[oppressed]]; yet
the gangrene which the vices [[vice]], engendered by oppression have
produced, is not confined to the morbid part, but pervades society
at large;  so that when i [[wish]] to see my [[sex]] become more like moral
agents, my [[heart]] bounds with the anticipation of the general
diffusion of that sublime contentment which only morality can
diffuse.


chapter 13.

some instances of the folly which the ignorance of [[women]] generates;
with concluding reflections on the [[moral]] improvement that a
revolution in female manners might naturally be expected to
produce.

there are many follies, in some [[degree]], peculiar to [[women]]:  sins
against [[reason]], of commission, as well as of omission; but all
flowing from ignorance or prejudice, i shall only point out such as
appear to be injurious to their [[moral]] [[character]].  and in
animadverting on them, i [[wish]] especially to prove, that the
weakness of [[mind]] and [[body]], which [[men]] have endeavoured by various
motives to perpetuate, prevents their discharging the peculiar duty
of their [[sex]]:  for when weakness of [[body]] will not permit them to
suckle their [[children]], and weakness of [[mind]] makes them spoil their
tempers--is woman in a [[natural]] [[state]]?

section 13.1.

one glaring instance of the weakness which proceeds from ignorance,
first claims attention, and calls for severe reproof.

in this metropolis a number of lurking leeches infamously gain a
subsistence by practising on the credulity of [[women]], pretending to
cast nativities, to use the technical phrase; and many females who,
proud of their rank and [[fortune]], look down on the vulgar with
sovereign contempt, show by this credulity, that the distinction is
arbitrary, and that they have not sufficiently cultivated their
minds to rise above vulgar prejudices.  [[women]], because they have
not been [[led]] to consider the [[knowledge]] of their [[duty]] as the one
thing necessary to [[know]], or, to [[live]] in the [[present]] moment by the
discharge of it, are very anxious to peep into futurity, to learn
what they have to expect to render [[life]] interesting, and to break
the vacuum of ignorance.  i must be allowed to expostulate
seriously with the ladies [[lady]], who [[follow]] these idle inventions; for
ladies, mistresses of families [[family]], are not ashamed to drive in their
own carriages to the door of the cunning [[man]].  and if any of them
should peruse this [[work]], i entreat them to [[answer]] to their own
hearts the following questions [[question]], not forgetting that they are in the
presence of [[god]].

do you [[believe]] that there is but one [[god]], and that he is powerful,
wise, and [[good]]?

do you [[believe]] that all things were created by him, and that all
beings are dependent on him?

do you rely on his [[wisdom]], so conspicuous in his works [[work]], and in your
own frame, and are you convinced, that he has ordered all things
which do not come under the cognizance of your senses, in the same
perfect harmony, to fulfil his designs?

do you acknowledge that the [[power]] of looking into futurity and
seeing things that are not, as if they were, is an attribute of the
creator?  and should he, by an impression on the minds [[mind]] of his
creatures, [[think]] fit to impart to them some event hid in the shades
of [[time]], yet unborn, to whom would the secret be revealed by
immediate inspiration?  the [[opinion]] of ages [[age]] will [[answer]] this
question--to reverend old [[men]], to [[people]] distinguished for eminent
piety.

the oracles of old were thus delivered by priests [[priest]] dedicated to the
service of the [[god]], who was supposed to inspire them.  the glare of
worldly pomp which surrounded these impostors, and the [[respect]] paid
to them by artful politicians, who knew how to avail themselves of
this useful engine to bend the necks of the [[strong]] under the
dominion of the cunning, spread a [[sacred]] mysterious veil of
sanctity over their lies [[lie]] and abominations.  impressed by such
solemn devotional parade, a [[greek]] or roman [[lady]] might be excused,
if she inquired of the oracle, when she was anxious to pry into
futurity, or inquire about some dubious event:  and her inquiries,
however contrary to [[reason]], could not be reckoned impious.  but,
can the professors of [[christianity]] ward off that imputation?  can a
christian suppose, that the favourites of the most high, the highly
favoured would be obliged to lurk in [[disguise]], and practise the
most dishonest tricks to [[cheat]] silly [[women]] out of the [[money]], which
the [[poor]] cry for in [[vain]]?

say not that such questions [[question]] are an insult to [[common]] sense for it is
your own conduct, o ye foolish women! which throws an odium on your
sex!  and these reflections should make you shudder at your
thoughtlessness, and irrational devotion, for i do not suppose that
all of you laid aside your [[religion]], such as it is, when you
entered those mysterious dwellings.  yet, as i have throughout
supposed myself talking to ignorant [[women]], for ignorant ye are in
the most emphatical sense of the word, it would be absurd to reason
with you on the egregious folly of desiring to [[know]] what the
supreme [[wisdom]] has concealed.

probably you would not [[understand]] me, were i to attempt to show you
that it would be absolutely inconsistent with the grand [[purpose]] of
life, that of rendering [[human]] creatures [[wise]] and [[virtuous]]:  and
that, were it sanctioned by [[god]], it would disturb the order
established in creation; and if it be not sanctioned by [[god]], do you
expect to hear [[truth]]?  can events be foretold, events which have
not yet assumed a [[body]] to become [[subject]] to mortal inspection, can
they be foreseen by a vicious worldling, who pampers his appetites
by preying on the foolish ones?

perhaps, however, you devoutly [[believe]] in the [[devil]], and imagine,
to shift the [[question]], that he may assist his votaries? but if
really respecting the [[power]] of such a being, an [[enemy]] to goodness
and to [[god]], can you go to [[church]] after having been under such an
obligation to him.  from these delusions to those still more
fashionable deceptions, practised by the whole tribe of
magnetisers, the transition is very [[natural]].  with [[respect]] to them,
it is equally proper to ask [[women]] a few questions [[question]].

do you [[know]] any thing of the construction of the [[human]] frame?  if
not, it is proper that you should be told, what every child ought
to [[know]], that when its admirable economy has been disturbed by
intemperance or indolence, i speak not of [[violent]] disorders, but of
chronical diseases, it must be brought into a healthy [[state]] again
by slow degrees [[degree]], and if the functions of [[life]] have not been
materially injured, regimen, another word for temperance, air,
exercise, and a few medicines prescribed by persons [[person]] who have
studied the [[human]] [[body]], are the only [[human]] means, yet discovered,
of recovering that inestimable blessing health, that will bear
investigation.

do you then [[believe]], that these magnetisers, who, by hocus pocus
tricks, pretend, to [[work]] a miracle, are delegated by [[god]], or
assisted by the solver of all these [[kind]] of difficulties--the
devil.

do they, when they put to flight, as it is said, disorders that
have baffled the powers [[power]] of medicine, [[work]] in conformity to the
light of [[reason]]? or do they effect these wonderful cures by
supernatural aid?

by a communication, an adept may [[answer]], with the [[world]] of spirits.
a [[noble]] [[privilege]], it must be allowed.  some of the ancients
mention familiar demons, who guarded them from danger, by kindly
intimating (we cannot guess in what manner,) when any danger was
nigh; or pointed out what they ought to undertake.  yet the [[men]] who
laid claim to this [[privilege]], out of the order of [[nature]], insisted,
that it was the [[reward]] or consequence of superior temperance and
piety.  but the [[present]] workers of wonders are not raised above
their fellows by superior temperance or [[sanctity]].  they do not cure
for the [[love]] of [[god]], but [[money]].  these are the priests [[priest]] of quackery,
though it be true they have not the convenient expedient of selling
masses for souls [[soul]] in [[purgatory]], nor churches [[church]], where they can display
crutches, and models of limbs made sound by a touch or a word.

i am not conversant with the technical terms, nor initiated into
the arcana, therefore i may speak improperly; but it is clear, that
men who will not conform to the [[law]] of [[reason]], and earn a
subsistence in an honest way, by degrees [[degree]], are very fortunate in
becoming acquainted with such obliging spirits.  we cannot, indeed,
give them credit for either [[great]] sagacity or goodness, else they
would have chosen more [[noble]] instruments, when they wished to show
themselves the benevolent [[friends]] of [[man]].

it is, however, little short of blasphemy to pretend to such [[power]].

>from the whole tenor of the dispensations of providence, it appears
evident to sober [[reason]], that [[certain]] vices [[vice]] [[produce]] certain
effects: and can any one so grossly insult the [[wisdom]] of [[god]], as to
suppose, that a miracle will be allowed to disturb his general
laws, to restore to health the intemperate and vicious, merely to
enable them to pursue the same course with impunity?  be whole, and
sin no more, said [[jesus]].  and are greater [[miracles]] to be performed
by those who do not [[follow]] his footsteps, who healed the [[body]] to
reach the [[mind]]?

the mentioning of the name of [[christ]], after such vile impostors may
displease some of my readers--i [[respect]] their warmth; but let them
not forget, that the followers of these delusions bear his name,
and profess to be the disciples of him, who said, by their works [[work]] we
should [[know]] who were the [[children]] of [[god]] or the servants of [[sin]].  i
allow that it is easier to touch the [[body]] of a saint, or to be
magnetised, than to restrain our appetites or govern our [[passions]];
but health of [[body]] or [[mind]] can only be recovered by these means, or
we make the supreme [[judge]] partial and revengeful.

is he a [[man]], that he should [[change]], or punish out of resentment?
he--the [[common]] [[father]], wounds but to heal, says [[reason]], and our
irregularities producing [[certain]] consequences, we are forcibly
shown the [[nature]] of [[vice]]; that thus learning to [[know]] [[good]] from
evil, by [[experience]], we may hate one and [[love]] the other, in
proportion to the [[wisdom]] which we attain.  the poison contains the
antidote; and we either reform our [[evil]] habits, and cease to sin
against our own bodies [[body]], to use the forcible [[language]] of [[scripture]],
or a premature [[death]], the [[punishment]] of [[sin]], snaps the thread of
life.

here an awful stop is put to our inquiries.  but, why should i
conceal my sentiments?  considering the attributes of [[god]], i
believe, that whatever [[punishment]] may [[follow]], will tend, like the
anguish of disease, to show the malignity of [[vice]], for the purpose
of reformation.  positive [[punishment]] appears so contrary to the
nature of [[god]], discoverable in all his works [[work]], and in our own
reason, that i could sooner [[believe]] that the deity paid no
attention to the conduct of [[men]], than that he punished without the
benevolent design of reforming.

to suppose only, that an all-wise and powerful being, as [[good]] as he
is [[great]], should create a being, foreseeing, that after fifty or
sixty years of feverish existence, it would be plunged into never
ending woe--is blasphemy.  on what will the worm feed that is never
to [[die]]?  on folly, on ignorance, say ye--i should blush indignantly
at drawing the [[natural]] conclusion, could i insert it, and [[wish]] to
withdraw myself from the wing of my god!  on such a supposition, i
speak with reverence, he would be a consuming [[fire]].  we should
wish, though vainly, to fly from his presence when [[fear]] absorbed
love, and darkness involved all his counsels.

i [[know]] that many devout [[people]] boast of submitting to the will of
god blindly, as to an arbitrary sceptre or rod, on the same
principle as the indians [[indian]] [[worship]] the [[devil]].  in other words, like
people in the [[common]] concerns of [[life]], they do homage to [[power]], and
cringe under the foot that can crush them.  [[rational]] [[religion]], on
the contrary, is a submission to the will of a being so perfectly
wise, that all he wills must be directed by the proper motive--must
be reasonable.

and, if thus we [[respect]] [[god]], can we give credit to the mysterious
insinuations which insult his laws [[law]]?  can we [[believe]], though it
should stare us in the face, that he would [[work]] a miracle to
authorize confusion by sanctioning an error?  yet we must either
allow these impious conclusions, or treat with contempt every
promise to restore health to a diseased [[body]] by supernatural means,
or to foretell, the incidents that can only be foreseen by [[god]].

section 13.2.

another instance of that feminine weakness of [[character]], often
produced by a confined [[education]], is a romantic twist of the [[mind]],
which has been very properly termed sentimental.

women, subjected by ignorance to their sensations, and only taught
to look for [[happiness]] in [[love]], refine on sensual feelings, and
adopt metaphysical notions respecting that passion, which lead them
shamefully to neglect the duties [[duty]] of [[life]], and frequently in the
midst of these sublime refinements they plunge into actual [[vice]].

these are the [[women]] who are amused by the reveries of the stupid
novelists, who, knowing little of [[human]] [[nature]], [[work]] up stale
tales, and describe meretricious scenes, all retailed in a
sentimental jargon, which equally tend to [[corrupt]] the taste, and
draw the [[heart]] aside from its daily duties [[duty]].  i do not mention the
understanding, because never having been exercised, its slumbering
energies rest inactive, like the lurking particles of [[fire]] which
are supposed universally to pervade matter.

females, in [[fact]], denied all [[political]] privileges [[privilege]], and not allowed,
as [[married]] [[women]], excepting in [[criminal]] cases, a civil existence,
have their attention naturally drawn from the interest of the whole
community to that of the minute parts, though the private [[duty]] of
any member of [[society]] must be very imperfectly performed, when not
connected with the general [[good]].  the mighty [[business]] of female
life is to please, and, restrained from entering into more
important concerns by [[political]] and civil oppression, sentiments
become events, and reflection deepens what it should, and would
have effaced, if the understanding had been allowed to take a wider
range.

but, confined to trifling employments, they naturally imbibe
opinions which the only [[kind]] of reading calculated to interest an
innocent frivolous [[mind]], inspires.  unable to grasp any thing
great, is it surprising that they find the reading of [[history]] a
very dry task, and disquisitions addressed to the understanding,
intolerably tedious, and almost unintelligible?  thus are they
necessarily dependent on the novelist for amusement.  yet, when i
exclaim against novels, i mean when contrasted with those works
which exercise the understanding and regulate the [[imagination]].  for
any [[kind]] of reading i [[think]] [[better]] than leaving a blank still a
blank, because the [[mind]] must receive a [[degree]] of enlargement, and
obtain a little [[strength]] by a slight exertion of its thinking
powers; besides, even the productions that are only addressed to
the [[imagination]], raise the reader a little above the gross
gratification of appetites, to which the [[mind]] has not given a shade
of delicacy.

this observation is the result of [[experience]]; for i have known
several notable [[women]], and one in particular, who was a very good
woman--as [[good]] as such a narrow [[mind]] would allow her to be, who
took [[care]] that her daughters [[daughter]] (three in number) should never see a
novel.  as she was a woman of [[fortune]] and [[fashion]], they had various
masters to attend them, and a sort of menial governess to watch
their footsteps.  from their masters they learned how tables,
chairs, etc. were called in french and italian; but as the few
books thrown in their way were far above their capacities, or
devotional, they neither acquired ideas [[idea]] nor sentiments, and passed
their [[time]], when not compelled to repeat words, in dressing,
quarrelling with each other, or conversing with their maids by
stealth, till they were brought into company as marriageable.

their [[mother]], a widow, was busy in the mean [[time]] in keeping up her
connexions, as she termed a numerous acquaintance lest her girls
should want a proper introduction into the [[great]] [[world]].  and these
young ladies [[lady]], with minds [[mind]] vulgar in every sense of the word, and
spoiled tempers, entered [[life]] puffed up with notions of their own
consequence, and looking down with contempt on those who could not
vie with them in dress and parade.

with [[respect]] to [[love]], [[nature]], or their nurses, had taken [[care]] to
teach them the physical meaning of the word; and, as they had few
topics of conversation, and fewer refinements of sentiment, they
expressed their gross wishes [[wish]] not in very delicate phrases, when
they spoke freely, talking of matrimony.

could these girls have been injured by the perusal of novels?  i
almost forgot a shade in the [[character]] of one of them; she affected
a simplicity bordering on folly, and with a simper would utter the
most immodest remarks and questions [[question]], the full meaning of which she
had learned whilst secluded from the [[world]], and afraid to speak in
her mother's presence, who governed with a high hand;  they were
all educated, as she prided herself, in a most exemplary manner;
and [[read]] their chapters [[chapter]] and psalms before breakfast, never touching
a silly novel.

this is only one instance; but i recollect many other [[women]] who,
not [[led]] by degrees [[degree]] to proper studies, and not permitted to choose
for themselves, have indeed been overgrown [[children]]; or have
obtained, by mixing in the [[world]], a little of what is termed common
sense;  that is, a distinct manner of seeing [[common]] occurrences, as
they stand detached:  but what deserves the name of [[intellect]], the
power of gaining general or abstract ideas [[idea]], or even intermediate
ones, was out of the [[question]].  their minds [[mind]] were quiescent, and
when they were not roused by sensible objects and employments of
that [[kind]], they were low-spirited, would cry, or go to sleep.

when, therefore, i advise my [[sex]] not to [[read]] such flimsy works [[work]], it
is to induce them to [[read]] something superior; for i coincide in
opinion with a sagacious [[man]], who, having a [[daughter]] and niece
under his [[care]], pursued a very different plan with each.

the niece, who had considerable abilities, had, before she was left
to his guardianship, been indulged in desultory reading.  her he
endeavoured to lead, and did lead, to [[history]] and [[moral]] essays; but
his [[daughter]] whom a fond [[weak]] [[mother]] had indulged, and who
consequently was averse to every thing like application, he allowed
to [[read]] novels;  and used to justify his conduct by saying, that if
she ever attained a relish for reading them, he should have some
foundation to [[work]] upon; and that erroneous opinions [[opinion]] were better
than none at all.

in [[fact]], the female [[mind]] has been so totally neglected, that
knowledge was only to be acquired from this muddy source, till from
reading novels some [[women]] of superior [[talents]] learned to despise
them.

the [[best]] method, i [[believe]], that can be adopted to [[correct]] a
fondness for novels is to ridicule them;  not indiscriminately, for
then it would have little effect; but, if a judicious [[person]], with
some turn for [[humour]], would [[read]] several to a [[young]] girl, and point
out, both by tones and apt comparisons with pathetic incidents and
heroic characters [[character]] in [[history]], how foolishly and ridiculously they
caricatured [[human]] [[nature]], just opinions [[opinion]] might be substituted
instead of romantic sentiments.

in one [[respect]], however, the majority of both sexes [[sex]] resemble, and
equally show a want of taste and modesty.  ignorant [[women]], forced
to be chaste to preserve their [[reputation]], allow their imagination
to revel in the unnatural and meretricious scenes sketched by the
novel writers of the day, slighting as insipid the sober dignity
and matronly grace of [[history]],* whilst [[men]] carry the same vitiated
taste into [[life]], and fly for amusement to the wanton, from the
unsophisticated charms of [[virtue]], and the grave respectability of
sense.

(*footnote.  i am not now alluding to that superiority of mind
which leads to the creation of ideal [[beauty]], when [[life]] surveyed
with a penetrating eye, appears a tragi-comedy, in which little can
be seen to satisfy the [[heart]] without the [[help]] of fancy.)

besides, the reading of novels makes [[women]], and particularly ladies
of [[fashion]], very fond of using [[strong]] expressions and superlatives
in conversation; and, though the dissipated artificial [[life]] which
they lead prevents their cherishing any [[strong]] legitimate passion,
the [[language]] of passion in affected tones slips for ever from their
glib tongues, and every trifle produces [[produce]] those phosphoric bursts
which only mimick in the dark the flame of passion.

section 13.3.

ignorance and the mistaken cunning that [[nature]] sharpens in weak
heads, as a [[principle]] of self-preservation, render [[women]] very fond
of dress, and [[produce]] all the vanity which such a fondness may
naturally be expected to generate, to the exclusion of emulation
and magnanimity.

i agree with [[rousseau]], that the physical part of the art [[arts]] of
pleasing consists in ornaments, and for that very [[reason]] i should
guard girls against the contagious fondness for dress so [[common]] to
weak [[women]], that they may not rest in the physical part.  yet, weak
are the [[women]] who imagine that they can long please without the aid
of the [[mind]]; or, in other words, without the [[moral]] art [[arts]] of pleasing.
but the [[moral]] art [[arts]], if it be not a profanation to use the word art [[arts]],
when alluding to the grace which is an effect of [[virtue]], and not
the motive of action, is never to be found with ignorance; the
sportiveness of innocence, so pleasing to refined libertines of
both sexes [[sex]], is widely different in its essence from this superior
gracefulness.

a [[strong]] inclination for external ornaments ever appears in
barbarous states, only the [[men]] not the [[women]] adorn themselves; for
where [[women]] are allowed to be so far on a level with [[men]], society
has advanced at least one step in [[civilization]].

the attention to dress, therefore, which has been [[thought]] a sexual
propensity, i [[think]] [[natural]] to [[mankind]].  but i ought to express
myself with more precision.  when the [[mind]] is not sufficiently
opened to take [[pleasure]] in reflection, the [[body]] will be adorned
with sedulous [[care]]; and [[ambition]] will appear in tattooing or
painting it.

so far is the first inclination carried, that even the hellish yoke
of [[slavery]] cannot stifle the savage [[desire]] of admiration which the
black heroes inherit from both their parents, for all the
hardly-earned savings of a [[slave]] are commonly expended in a little
tawdry finery.  and i have seldom known a [[good]] male or female
servant that was not particularly fond of dress.  their clothes
were their riches [[rich]]; and i argue from analogy, that the fondness for
dress, so extravagant in females, arises from the same cause--want
of cultivation of [[mind]].  when [[men]] meet they converse about
business, [[politics]], or literature; but, says swift, "how naturally
do [[women]] apply their hands to each others lappets and ruffles."
and very [[natural]] it is--for they have not any [[business]] to interest
them, have not a taste for literature, and they find [[politics]] dry,
because they have not acquired a [[love]] for [[mankind]] by turning their
thoughts to the grand pursuits that exalt the [[human]] [[race]] and
promote general [[happiness]].

besides, various are the paths to [[power]] and fame, which by accident
or [[choice]] [[men]] pursue, and though they jostle against each other,
for [[men]] of the same profession are seldom [[friends]], yet there is a
much greater number of their fellow-creatures with whom they never
clash.  but [[women]] are very differently situated with [[respect]] to
each other--for they are all rivals.

before [[marriage]] it is their [[business]] to please [[men]]; and after, with
a few exceptions, they [[follow]] the same scent, with all the
persevering pertinacity of instinct.  even [[virtuous]] [[women]] never
forget their [[sex]] in company, for they are for ever trying to make
themselves agreeable.  a female [[beauty]] and a male wit, appear to be
equally anxious to draw the attention of the company to themselves;
and the animosity of contemporary wits is proverbial.

is it then surprising, that when the sole [[ambition]] of woman centres
in [[beauty]], and interest gives vanity additional [[force]], perpetual
rivalships should ensue?  they are all running the same [[race]], and
would rise above the [[virtue]] of mortals if they did not view each
other with a suspicious and even envious eye.

an immoderate fondness for dress, for [[pleasure]] and for sway, are
the [[passions]] of savages; the [[passions]] that occupy those uncivilized
beings who have not yet extended the dominion of the [[mind]], or even
learned to [[think]] with the energy necessary to concatenate that
abstract train of [[thought]] which produces [[produce]] principles [[principle]].  and that
women, from their [[education]] and the [[present]] [[state]] of civilized
life, are in the same condition, cannot, i [[think]], be controverted.
to laugh at them then, or satirize the follies of a being who is
never to be allowed to act freely from the [[light]] of her own [[reason]],
is as absurd as cruel; for that they who are taught blindly to obey
authority, will endeavour cunningly to elude it, is most natural
and [[certain]].

yet let it be proved, that they ought to obey [[man]] implicitly, and i
shall immediately agree that it is woman's [[duty]] to cultivate a
fondness for dress, in order to please, and a propensity to cunning
for her own preservation.

the virtues [[virtue]], however, which are supported by ignorance, must ever
be wavering--the house built on sand could not endure a storm.  it
is almost unnecessary to draw the inference.  if [[women]] are to be
made [[virtuous]] by [[authority]], which is a contradiction in terms, let
them be immured in seraglios and watched with a [[jealous]] eye.  fear
not that the iron will enter into their souls--for the souls [[soul]] that
can bear such treatment are made of yielding materials, just
animated enough to give [[life]] to the [[body]].

"matter too soft a lasting mark to bear,
and [[best]] distinguish'd by black, brown, or [[fair]]."

the most cruel wounds will of course soon heal, and they may still
people the [[world]], and dress to please man--all the purposes [[purpose]] which
certain celebrated writers have allowed that they were created to
fill.

section 13.4.

women are supposed to possess more sensibility, and even [[humanity]],
than [[men]], and their [[strong]] attachments and instantaneous emotions
of compassion are given as proofs; but the clinging affection of
ignorance has seldom any thing [[noble]] in it, and may mostly be
resolved into selfishness, as well as the affection of [[children]] and
brutes.  i have known many [[weak]] [[women]] whose sensibility was
entirely engrossed by their husbands; and as for their [[humanity]], it
was very faint indeed, or rather it was only a transient emotion of
compassion,  "humanity does not consist in a squeamish ear," says
an eminent orator.  "it belongs to the [[mind]] as well as the nerves."

but this [[kind]] of exclusive affection, though it degrade the
individual, should not be brought forward as a proof of the
inferiority of the [[sex]], because it is the [[natural]] consequence of
confined views:  for even [[women]] of superior sense, having their
attention turned to little employments, and private plans, rarely
rise to heroism, unless when spurred on by [[love]]; and [[love]] as an
heroic passion, like genius, appears but once in an [[age]].  i
therefore agree with the moralist who asserts, "that [[women]] have
seldom so much generosity as [[men]];" and that their narrow
affections, to which [[justice]] and [[humanity]] are often sacrificed,
render the [[sex]] apparently inferior, especially as they are commonly
inspired by [[men]]; but i contend, that the [[heart]] would expand as the
understanding gained [[strength]], if [[women]] were not depressed from
their cradles.

i [[know]] that a little sensibility and [[great]] weakness will [[produce]] a
strong [[sexual]] attachment, and that [[reason]] must cement [[friendship]];
consequently i allow, that more [[friendship]] is to be found in the
male than the female [[world]], and that [[men]] have a higher sense of
justice.  the exclusive affections of [[women]] seem indeed to resemble
cato's most [[unjust]] [[love]] for his [[country]].  he wished to crush
carthage, not to save [[rome]], but to promote its [[vain]] [[glory]]; and in
general, it is to similar principles [[principle]] that [[humanity]] is sacrificed,
for [[genuine]] duties [[duty]] support each other.

besides, how can [[women]] be just or generous, when they are the
slaves of [[injustice]].

section 13.5.

as the rearing of [[children]], that is, the laying a foundation of
sound health both of [[body]] and [[mind]] in the rising [[generation]], has
justly been insisted on as the peculiar destination of woman, the
ignorance that incapacitates them must be contrary to the order of
things.  and i contend, that their minds [[mind]] can take in much more, and
ought to do so, or they will never become sensible mothers [[mother]].  many
men attend to the breeding of horses, and overlook the management
of the stable, who would, [[strange]] want of sense and feeling! think
themselves degraded by paying any attention to the nursery; yet,
how many [[children]] are absolutely murdered by the ignorance of
women!  but when they escape, and are neither destroyed by
unnatural negligence nor blind fondness, how few are managed
properly with [[respect]] to the infant mind!  so that to break the
spirit, allowed to become vicious at [[home]], a child is sent to
school; and the methods taken there, which must be taken to keep a
number of [[children]] in order, scatter the seeds of almost every vice
in the soil thus forcibly torn up.

i have sometimes compared the struggles of these [[poor]] [[children]] who
ought never to have [[felt]] restraint, nor would, had they been always
held in with an even hand, to the despairing plunges of a spirited
filly, which i have seen breaking on a strand;  its feet sinking
deeper and deeper in the sand every [[time]] it endeavoured to throw
its rider, till at [[last]] it sullenly submitted.

i have always found horses, an animal i am attached to, very
tractable when treated with [[humanity]] and steadiness, so that i
doubt whether the [[violent]] methods taken to break them, do not
essentially injure them; i am, however, [[certain]] that a child should
never be thus forcibly tamed after it has injudiciously been
allowed to run wild; for every violation of [[justice]] and [[reason]], in
the treatment of [[children]], weakens their [[reason]].  and, so early do
they catch a [[character]], that the base of the [[moral]] [[character]],
experience leads me to infer, is fixed before their seventh year,
the period during which [[women]] are allowed the sole management of
children.  afterwards it too often happens that half the business
of [[education]] is to [[correct]], and very imperfectly is it done, if
done hastily, the faults [[fault]], which they would never have acquired if
their mothers [[mother]] had had more understanding.

one striking instance of the folly of [[women]] must not be omitted.
the manner in which they treat servants in the presence of
children, permitting them to suppose, that they ought to wait on
them, and bear their humours [[humour]].  a child should always be made to
receive assistance from a [[man]] or woman as a favour; and, as the
first lesson of independence, they should practically be taught, by
the [[example]] of their [[mother]], not to require that personal
attendance which it is an insult to [[humanity]] to require, when in
health; and instead of being [[led]] to assume airs of consequence, a
sense of their own weakness should first make them [[feel]] the natural
equality of [[man]].  yet, how frequently have i indignantly heard
servants imperiously called to put [[children]] to bed, and sent away
again and again, because master or miss hung about mamma, to stay a
little longer.  thus made slavishly to attend the little idol, all
those most disgusting humours [[humour]] were exhibited which characterize a
spoiled child.

in short, speaking of the majority of mothers [[mother]], they leave their
children entirely to the [[care]] of servants: or, because they are
their [[children]], treat them as if they were little demi-gods, though
i have always observed, that the [[women]] who thus idolize their
children, seldom show [[common]] [[humanity]] to servants, or [[feel]] the
least tenderness for any [[children]] but their own.

it is, however, these exclusive affections, and an individual
manner of seeing things, produced by ignorance, which keep women
for ever at a stand, with [[respect]] to improvement, and make many of
them dedicate their lives [[life]] to their [[children]] only to weaken their
bodies and spoil their tempers, frustrating also any plan of
education that a more [[rational]] [[father]] may adopt; for unless a
mother concurs, the [[father]] who restrains will ever be considered as
a [[tyrant]].

but, fulfilling the duties [[duty]] of a [[mother]], a woman with a sound
constitution, may still keep her [[person]] scrupulously neat, and
assist to maintain her [[family]], if necessary, or by reading and
conversations with both sexes [[sex]], indiscriminately, improve her [[mind]].
for [[nature]] has so wisely ordered things, that did [[women]] suckle
their [[children]], they would preserve their own health, and there
would be such an interval between the birth of each child, that we
should seldom see a house full of babes.  and did they pursue a
plan of conduct, and not waste their [[time]] in following the
fashionable vagaries of dress, the management of their household
and [[children]] need not shut them out from literature, nor prevent
their attaching themselves to a [[science]], with that steady eye which
strengthens the [[mind]], or practising one of the fine [[arts]] that
cultivate the taste.

but, visiting to display finery, card playing, and balls, not to
mention the idle bustle of morning trifling, draw [[women]] from their
duty, to render them insignificant, to render them pleasing,
according to the [[present]] acceptation of the word, to every [[man]], but
their husband.  for a round of pleasures [[pleasure]] in which the affections
are not exercised, cannot be said to improve the understanding,
though it be erroneously called seeing the [[world]]; yet the [[heart]] is
rendered cold and averse to [[duty]], by such a senseless intercourse,
which becomes necessary from habit, even when it has ceased to
amuse.

but, till more equality be established in [[society]], till ranks are
confounded and [[women]] freed, we shall not see that dignified
domestic [[happiness]], the simple grandeur of which cannot be relished
by ignorant or vitiated minds [[mind]]; nor will the important task of
education ever be properly begun till the [[person]] of a woman is no
longer preferred to her [[mind]].  for it would be as [[wise]] to expect
corn from tares, or figs from thistles, as that a foolish ignorant
woman should be a [[good]] [[mother]].

section 13.6.

it is not necessary to inform the sagacious reader, now i enter on
my concluding reflections, that the discussion of this subject
merely consists in opening a few simple principles [[principle]], and clearing
away the rubbish which obscured them.  but, as all readers are not
sagacious, i must be allowed to add some explanatory remarks to
bring the [[subject]] [[home]] to reason--to that sluggish [[reason]], which
supinely takes opinions [[opinion]] on trust, and obstinately supports them to
spare itself the [[labour]] of thinking.

moralists have unanimously agreed, that unless [[virtue]] be nursed by
liberty, it will never attain due strength--and what they say of
man i extend to [[mankind]], insisting, that in all cases morals [[moral]] must
be fixed on immutable principles [[principle]]; and that the being cannot be
termed [[rational]] or [[virtuous]], who obeys any [[authority]] but that of
reason.

to render [[women]] truly useful members of [[society]], i argue, that they
should be [[led]], by having their understandings cultivated on a large
scale, to acquire a [[rational]] affection for their [[country]], founded
on [[knowledge]], because it is obvious, that we are little interested
about what we do not [[understand]].  and to render this general
knowledge of due importance, i have endeavoured to show that
private duties [[duty]] are never properly fulfilled, unless the
understanding enlarges the [[heart]]; and that [[public]] [[virtue]] is only an
aggregate of private.  but, the distinctions established in society
undermine both, by beating out the solid gold of [[virtue]], till it
becomes only the tinsel-covering of [[vice]]; for, whilst wealth
renders a [[man]] more respectable than [[virtue]], [[wealth]] will be sought
before [[virtue]]; and, whilst women's persons [[person]] are caressed, when a
childish simper shows an absence of mind--the [[mind]] will [[lie]] fallow.
yet, true voluptuousness must proceed from the mind--for what can
equal the sensations produced by mutual affection, supported by
mutual [[respect]]?  what are the cold or feverish caresses of
appetite, but [[sin]] embracing [[death]], compared with the modest
overflowings of a pure [[heart]] and exalted [[imagination]]?  yes, let me
tell the libertine of fancy when he despises understanding in
woman--that the [[mind]], which he disregards, gives [[life]] to the
enthusiastic affection from which rapture, short-lived as it is,
alone can flow!  and, that, without [[virtue]], a [[sexual]] attachment
must expire, like a tallow candle in the socket, creating
intolerable disgust.  to prove this, i need only observe, that men
who have wasted [[great]] part of their lives [[life]] with [[women]], and with whom
they have sought for [[pleasure]] with eager thirst, entertain the
meanest [[opinion]] of the [[sex]].  [[virtue]], true refiner of joy! if
foolish [[men]] were to fright thee from [[earth]], in order to give loose
to all their appetites without a check--some sensual wight of taste
would scale the heavens [[heaven]] to invite thee back, to give a zest to
pleasure!

that [[women]] at [[present]] are by ignorance rendered foolish or vicious,
is, i [[think]], not to be disputed; and, that the most salutary
effects tending to improve [[mankind]], might be expected from a
revolution in female manners, appears at least, with a face of
probability, to rise out of the observation.  for as [[marriage]] has
been termed the parent of those endearing charities, which draw man
from the brutal herd, the corrupting intercourse that [[wealth]],
idleness, and folly [[produce]] between the sexes [[sex]], is more universally
injurious to morality, than all the other vices [[vice]] of mankind
collectively considered.  to adulterous [[lust]] the most [[sacred]] duties
are sacrificed, because, before [[marriage]], [[men]], by a promiscuous
intimacy with [[women]], learned to consider [[love]] as a selfish
gratification--learned to separate it not only from esteem, but
from the affection merely built on habit, which mixes a little
humanity with it.  [[justice]] and [[friendship]] are also set at defiance,
and that purity of taste is vitiated, which would naturally lead a
man to relish an artless display of affection, rather than affected
airs.  but that [[noble]] simplicity of affection, which dares to
appear unadorned, has few attractions for the libertine, though it
be the charm, which, by cementing the matrimonial tie, secures to
the pledges of a warmer passion the necessary parental attention;
for [[children]] will never be properly educated till friendship
subsists between parents.  [[virtue]] flies from a house divided
against itself--and a whole legion of devils [[devil]] take up their
residence there.

the affection of husbands and wives [[wife]] cannot be pure when they have
so few sentiments in [[common]], and when so little confidence is
established at [[home]], as must be the case when their pursuits are so
different.  that intimacy from which tenderness should flow, will
not, cannot subsist between the vicious.

contending, therefore, that the [[sexual]] distinction, which [[men]] have
so warmly insisted upon, is arbitrary, i have dwelt on an
observation, that several sensible [[men]], with whom i have conversed
on the [[subject]], allowed to be well founded; and it is simply this,
that the little chastity to be found amongst [[men]], and consequent
disregard of modesty, tend to degrade both sexes [[sex]]; and further, that
the modesty of [[women]], characterized as such, will often be only the
artful veil of wantonness, instead of being the [[natural]] reflection
of purity, till modesty be universally respected.

>from the [[tyranny]] of [[man]], i firmly [[believe]], the greater number of
female follies proceed; and the cunning, which i allow, makes at
present a part of their [[character]], i likewise have repeatedly
endeavoured to prove, is produced by oppression.  were not
dissenters, for instance, a class of [[people]], with strict truth
characterized as cunning?  and may i not lay some stress on this
fact to prove, that when any [[power]] but [[reason]] curbs the [[free]] spirit
of [[man]], dissimulation is practised, and the various shifts of art
are naturally called forth?  [[great]] attention to decorum, which was
carried to a [[degree]] of scrupulosity, and all that puerile bustle
about trifles and consequential solemnity, which butler's
caricature of a dissenter brings before the [[imagination]], shaped
their persons [[person]] as well as their minds [[mind]] in the mould of prim
littleness.  i speak collectively, for i [[know]] how many ornaments to
human [[nature]] have been enrolled amongst sectaries; yet, i assert,
that the same narrow prejudice for their sect, which [[women]] have for
their families [[family]], prevailed in the dissenting part of the [[community]],
however worthy in other respects [[respect]]; and also that the same timid
prudence, or headstrong efforts, often disgraced the exertions of
both.  oppression thus formed many of the features of their
character perfectly to coincide with that of the [[oppressed]] half of
mankind; for is it not notorious, that dissenters were like [[women]],
fond of deliberating together, and asking [[advice]] of each other,
till by a complication of little contrivances, some little end was
brought about?  a similar attention to preserve their reputation
was conspicuous in the dissenting and female [[world]], and was
produced by a similar cause.

asserting the rights [[right]] which [[women]] in [[common]] with [[men]] ought to
contend for, i have not attempted to extenuate their faults [[fault]]; but to
prove them to be the [[natural]] consequence of their [[education]] and
station in [[society]].  if so, it is reasonable to suppose, that they
will [[change]] their [[character]], and [[correct]] their vices [[vice]] and follies,
when they are allowed to be [[free]] in a physical, [[moral]], and civil
sense.

let woman share the rights [[right]], and she will emulate the virtues [[virtue]] of
man; for she must grow more [[perfect]] when emancipated, or justify
the [[authority]] that chains such a [[weak]] being to her [[duty]].  if the
latter, it will be expedient to open a fresh [[trade]] with russia for
whips; a [[present]] which a [[father]] should always make to his
son-in-law on his wedding day, that a husband may keep his whole
family in order by the same means; and without any violation of
justice reign, wielding this sceptre, sole master of his house,
because he is the only being in it who has [[reason]]; the [[divine]],
indefeasible, earthly sovereignty breathed into [[man]] by the master
of the [[universe]].  allowing this position, [[women]] have not any
inherent rights [[right]] to claim; and, by the same [[rule]] their duties
vanish, for rights [[right]] and duties [[duty]] are inseparable.

be just then, o ye [[men]] of understanding! and mark not more severely
what [[women]] do amiss, than the vicious tricks of the horse or the
ass for whom ye provide provender, and allow her the privileges [[privilege]] of
ignorance, to whom ye deny the rights [[right]] of [[reason]], or ye will be
worse than egyptian task-masters, expecting [[virtue]] where [[nature]] has
not given understanding!
