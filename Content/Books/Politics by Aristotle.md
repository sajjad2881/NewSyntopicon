every [[state]] is a [[community]] of some [[kind]], and every [[community]] is established with a view to some [[good]]; for [[mankind]] always act in order to obtain that which they [[think]] [[good]]. but, if all communities [[community]] aim at some [[good]], the [[state]] or [[political]] [[community]], which is the highest of all, and which embraces all the rest, aims at [[good]] in a greater [[degree]] than any other, and at the highest [[good]]. 

some [[people]] [[think]] that the qualifications of a statesman, [[king]], householder, and master are the same, and that they differ, not in [[kind]], but only in the number of their subjects [[subject]]. for [[example]], the ruler over a few is called a master; over more, the manager of a household; over a still larger number, a statesman or [[king]], as if there were no difference between a [[great]] household and a small [[state]]. the distinction which is made between the [[king]] and the statesman is as follows: when the [[government]] is personal, the ruler is a [[king]]; when, according to the rules [[rule]] of the [[political]] [[science]], the [[citizens]] [[rule]] and are ruled in turn, then he is called a statesman. 

but all this is a mistake; for governments [[government]] differ in [[kind]], as will be evident to any one who considers the matter according to the method which has hitherto guided us. as in other departments of [[science]], so in [[politics]], the compound should always be resolved into the simple elements or least parts of the whole. we must therefore look at the elements of which the [[state]] is composed, in order that we may see in what the different kinds [[kind]] of [[rule]] differ from one another, and whether any scientific result can be attained about each one of them. 

part ii 

he who thus considers things in their first [[growth]] and origin, whether a [[state]] or anything else, will obtain the clearest view of them. in the first place there must be a union of those who cannot [[exist]] without each other; namely, of male and female, that the [[race]] may continue (and this is a union which is formed, not of deliberate [[purpose]], but because, in [[common]] with other animals and with plants, [[mankind]] have a [[natural]] [[desire]] to leave behind them an image of themselves), and of [[natural]] ruler and [[subject]], that both may be preserved. for that which can foresee by the exercise of [[mind]] is by [[nature]] intended to be [[lord]] and master, and that which can with its [[body]] give effect to such foresight is a [[subject]], and by [[nature]] a [[slave]]; hence master and [[slave]] have the same interest. now [[nature]] has distinguished between the female and the [[slave]]. for she is not niggardly, like the smith who fashions the delphian knife for many uses; she makes each thing for a [[single]] use, and every instrument is [[best]] made when intended for one and not for many uses. but among barbarians no distinction is made between [[women]] and slaves [[slave]], because there is no [[natural]] ruler among them: they are a [[community]] of slaves [[slave]], male and female. wherefore the poets say, 

"it is meet that hellenes should [[rule]] over barbarians; "

as if they [[thought]] that the barbarian and the [[slave]] were by [[nature]] one. 

out of these two relationships between [[man]] and woman, master and [[slave]], the first thing to arise is the [[family]], and hesiod is [[right]] when he says, 

"first house and [[wife]] and an ox for the plough, "

for the ox is the [[poor]] man's [[man]] [[slave]]. the [[family]] is the association established by [[nature]] for the supply of men's everyday wants, and the members of it are called by charondas 'companions of the cupboard,' and by epimenides the cretan, 'companions of the manger.' but when several families [[family]] are [[united]], and the association aims at something more than the supply of daily needs, the first [[society]] to be formed is the village. and the most [[natural]] form of the village appears to be that of a colony from the [[family]], composed of the [[children]] and grandchildren, who are said to be suckled 'with the same milk.' and this is the [[reason]] why hellenic states were originally governed by kings [[king]]; because the hellenes were under [[royal]] [[rule]] before they came together, as the barbarians still are. every [[family]] is ruled by the eldest, and therefore in the colonies of the [[family]] the kingly form of [[government]] prevailed because they were of the same [[blood]]. as [[homer]] says: 

"each one gives [[law]] to his [[children]] and to his wives [[wife]]. "

for they lived dispersedly, as was the manner in ancient times [[time]]. wherefore [[men]] say that the gods have a [[king]], because they themselves either are or were in ancient times [[time]] under the [[rule]] of a [[king]]. for they imagine, not only the forms of the gods, but their ways of [[life]] to be like their own. 

when several villages are [[united]] in a [[single]] complete [[community]], large enough to be nearly or quite self-sufficing, the [[state]] comes into existence, originating in the bare needs of [[life]], and continuing in existence for the sake of a [[good]] [[life]]. and therefore, if the earlier forms of [[society]] are [[natural]], so is the [[state]], for it is the end of them, and the [[nature]] of a thing is its end. for what each thing is when fully developed, we call its [[nature]], whether we are speaking of a [[man]], a horse, or a [[family]]. besides, the final cause and end of a thing is the [[best]], and to be self-sufficing is the end and the [[best]]. 

hence it is evident that the [[state]] is a creation of [[nature]], and that [[man]] is by [[nature]] a [[political]] animal. and he who by [[nature]] and not by mere accident is without a [[state]], is either a [[bad]] [[man]] or above [[humanity]]; he is like the 

"tribeless, lawless, hearthless one, "

whom [[homer]] denounces- the [[natural]] outcast is forthwith a lover of [[war]]; he may be compared to an isolated piece at draughts. 

now, that [[man]] is more of a [[political]] animal than bees or any other gregarious animals is evident. [[nature]], as we often say, makes nothing in [[vain]], and [[man]] is the only animal whom she has endowed with the gift of [[speech]]. and whereas mere voice is but an indication of [[pleasure]] or [[pain]], and is therefore found in other animals (for their [[nature]] attains to the perception of [[pleasure]] and [[pain]] and the intimation of them to one another, and no further), the [[power]] of [[speech]] is intended to set forth the expedient and inexpedient, and therefore likewise the just and the [[unjust]]. and it is a characteristic of [[man]] that he alone has any sense of [[good]] and [[evil]], of just and [[unjust]], and the like, and the association of living beings who have this sense makes a [[family]] and a [[state]]. 

further, the [[state]] is by [[nature]] clearly prior to the [[family]] and to the [[individual]], since the whole is of necessity prior to the part; for [[example]], if the whole [[body]] be destroyed, there will be no foot or hand, except in an equivocal sense, as we might speak of a stone hand; for when destroyed the hand will be no [[better]] than that. but things are defined by their working and [[power]]; and we ought not to say that they are the same when they no longer have their proper quality, but only that they have the same name. the proof that the [[state]] is a creation of [[nature]] and prior to the [[individual]] is that the [[individual]], when isolated, is not self-sufficing; and therefore he is like a part in relation to the whole. but he who is unable to [[live]] in [[society]], or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a [[god]]: he is no part of a [[state]]. a social instinct is implanted in all [[men]] by [[nature]], and yet he who first founded the [[state]] was the [[greatest]] of benefactors. for [[man]], when perfected, is the [[best]] of animals, but, when separated from [[law]] and [[justice]], he is the worst of all; since armed [[injustice]] is the more dangerous, and he is equipped at birth with arms, meant to be used by [[intelligence]] and [[virtue]], which he may use for the worst ends. wherefore, if he have not [[virtue]], he is the most unholy and the most savage of animals, and the most full of [[lust]] and gluttony. but [[justice]] is the bond of [[men]] in states, for the administration of [[justice]], which is the determination of what is just, is the [[principle]] of order in [[political]] [[society]].

part iii 

seeing then that the [[state]] is made up of households, before speaking of the [[state]] we must speak of the management of the household. the parts of household management correspond to the persons [[person]] who compose the household, and a complete household consists of slaves [[slave]] and freemen. now we should begin by examining everything in its fewest possible elements; and the first and fewest possible parts of a [[family]] are master and [[slave]], husband and [[wife]], [[father]] and [[children]]. we have therefore to consider what each of these three relations is and ought to be: i mean the relation of master and servant, the [[marriage]] relation (the conjunction of [[man]] and [[wife]] has no name of its own), and thirdly, the procreative relation (this also has no proper name). and there is another element of a household, the so-called art [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]], which, according to some, is identical with household management, according to others, a principal part of it; the [[nature]] of this art [[arts]] will also have to be considered by us. 

let us first speak of master and [[slave]], looking to the needs of practical [[life]] and also seeking to attain some [[better]] theory of their relation than exists at [[present]]. for some are of [[opinion]] that the [[rule]] of a master is a [[science]], and that the management of a household, and the mastership of slaves [[slave]], and the [[political]] and [[royal]] [[rule]], as i was saying at the outset, are all the same. others affirm that the [[rule]] of a master over slaves [[slave]] is contrary to [[nature]], and that the distinction between [[slave]] and freeman exists by [[law]] only, and not by [[nature]]; and being an interference with [[nature]] is therefore [[unjust]]. 

part iv 

property is a part of the household, and the art [[arts]] of acquiring [[property]] is a part of the art [[arts]] of managing the household; for no [[man]] can [[live]] well, or indeed [[live]] at all, unless he be provided with necessaries. and as in the [[arts]] which have a definite sphere the workers must have their own proper instruments for the accomplishment of their [[work]], so it is in the management of a household. now instruments are of various sorts; some are living, others lifeless; in the rudder, the pilot of a ship has a lifeless, in the look-out [[man]], a living instrument; for in the [[arts]] the servant is a [[kind]] of instrument. thus, too, a possession is an instrument for maintaining [[life]]. and so, in the arrangement of the [[family]], a [[slave]] is a living possession, and [[property]] a number of such instruments; and the servant is himself an instrument which takes precedence of all other instruments. for if every instrument could accomplish its own [[work]], obeying or anticipating the will of others, like the statues of daedalus, or the tripods of hephaestus, which, says the poet, 

"of their own accord entered the assembly of the gods; "

if, in like manner, the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them, [[chief]] workmen would not want servants, nor masters slaves [[slave]]. here, however, another distinction must be drawn; the instruments commonly so called are instruments of production, whilst a possession is an instrument of action. the shuttle, for [[example]], is not only of use; but something else is made by it, whereas of a garment or of a bed there is only the use. further, as production and action are different in [[kind]], and both require instruments, the instruments which they employ must likewise differ in [[kind]]. but [[life]] is action and not production, and therefore the [[slave]] is the minister of action. again, a possession is spoken of as a part is spoken of; for the part is not only a part of something else, but wholly belongs to it; and this is also true of a possession. the master is only the master of the [[slave]]; he does not belong to him, whereas the [[slave]] is not only the [[slave]] of his master, but wholly belongs to him. hence we see what is the [[nature]] and office of a [[slave]]; he who is by [[nature]] not his own but another's [[man]], is by [[nature]] a [[slave]]; and he may be said to be another's [[man]] who, being a [[human]] being, is also a possession. and a possession may be defined as an instrument of action, separable from the possessor. 

part v 

but is there any one thus intended by [[nature]] to be a [[slave]], and for whom such a condition is expedient and [[right]], or rather is not all [[slavery]] a violation of [[nature]]? 

there is no difficulty in answering this [[question]], on grounds both of [[reason]] and of [[fact]]. for that some should [[rule]] and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for [[rule]]. 

and there are many kinds [[kind]] both of rulers and subjects [[subject]] (and that [[rule]] is the [[better]] which is exercised over [[better]] subjects- for [[example]], to [[rule]] over [[men]] is [[better]] than to [[rule]] over wild beasts; for the [[work]] is [[better]] which is executed by [[better]] workmen, and where one [[man]] rules [[rule]] and another is ruled, they may be said to have a work); for in all things which form a composite whole and which are made up of parts, whether continuous or discrete, a distinction between the ruling and the [[subject]] element comes to [[fight]]. such a duality exists in living creatures, but not in them only; it originates in the [[constitution]] of the [[universe]]; even in things which have no [[life]] there is a ruling [[principle]], as in a musical mode. but we are wandering from the [[subject]]. we will therefore restrict ourselves to the living creature, which, in the first place, consists of [[soul]] and [[body]]: and of these two, the one is by [[nature]] the ruler, and the other the [[subject]]. but then we must look for the intentions of [[nature]] in things which retain their [[nature]], and not in things which are corrupted. and therefore we must study the [[man]] who is in the most [[perfect]] [[state]] both of [[body]] and [[soul]], for in him we shall see the true relation of the two; although in [[bad]] or corrupted natures [[nature]] the [[body]] will often appear to [[rule]] over the [[soul]], because they are in an [[evil]] and unnatural condition. at all events we may firstly observe in living creatures both a despotical and a constitutional [[rule]]; for the [[soul]] rules [[rule]] the [[body]] with a despotical [[rule]], whereas the [[intellect]] rules [[rule]] the appetites with a constitutional and [[royal]] [[rule]]. and it is clear that the [[rule]] of the [[soul]] over the [[body]], and of the [[mind]] and the [[rational]] element over the passionate, is [[natural]] and expedient; whereas the equality of the two or the [[rule]] of the inferior is always hurtful. the same holds [[good]] of animals in relation to [[men]]; for tame animals have a [[better]] [[nature]] than wild, and all tame animals are [[better]] off when they are ruled by [[man]]; for then they are preserved. again, the male is by [[nature]] superior, and the female inferior; and the one rules [[rule]], and the other is ruled; this [[principle]], of necessity, extends to all [[mankind]]. 

where then there is such a difference as that between [[soul]] and [[body]], or between [[men]] and animals (as in the case of those whose [[business]] is to use their [[body]], and who can do nothing better), the lower sort are by [[nature]] slaves [[slave]], and it is [[better]] for them as for all inferiors that they should be under the [[rule]] of a master. for he who can be, and therefore is, another's and he who participates in [[rational]] [[principle]] enough to apprehend, but not to have, such a [[principle]], is a [[slave]] by [[nature]]. whereas the lower animals cannot even apprehend a [[principle]]; they obey their instincts. and indeed the use made of slaves [[slave]] and of tame animals is not very different; for both with their bodies [[body]] minister to the needs of [[life]]. [[nature]] would like to distinguish between the bodies [[body]] of freemen and slaves [[slave]], making the one [[strong]] for servile labor, the other upright, and although useless for such services, useful for [[political]] [[life]] in the [[arts]] both of [[war]] and [[peace]]. but the opposite often happens- that some have the souls [[soul]] and others have the bodies [[body]] of freemen. and doubtless if [[men]] differed from one another in the mere forms of their bodies [[body]] as much as the statues of the gods do from [[men]], all would acknowledge that the inferior class should be slaves [[slave]] of the superior. and if this is true of the [[body]], how much more just that a similar distinction should [[exist]] in the [[soul]]? but the [[beauty]] of the [[body]] is seen, whereas the [[beauty]] of the [[soul]] is not seen. it is clear, then, that some [[men]] are by [[nature]] [[free]], and others slaves [[slave]], and that for these latter [[slavery]] is both expedient and [[right]]. 

part vi 

but that those who take the opposite view have in a [[certain]] way [[right]] on their side, may be easily seen. for the words [[slavery]] and [[slave]] are used in two senses. there is a [[slave]] or [[slavery]] by [[law]] as well as by [[nature]]. the [[law]] of which i speak is a sort of convention- the [[law]] by which whatever is taken in [[war]] is supposed to belong to the victors. but this [[right]] many jurists impeach, as they would an orator who brought forward an unconstitutional measure: they detest the notion that, because one [[man]] has the [[power]] of doing [[violence]] and is superior in brute [[strength]], another shall be his [[slave]] and [[subject]]. even among [[philosophers]] there is a difference of [[opinion]]. the origin of the dispute, and what makes the views invade each other's territory, is as follows: in some sense [[virtue]], when furnished with means, has actually the [[greatest]] [[power]] of exercising [[force]]; and as superior [[power]] is only found where there is superior excellence of some [[kind]], [[power]] seems to imply [[virtue]], and the dispute to be simply one about [[justice]] (for it is due to one party identifying [[justice]] with goodwill while the other identifies it with the mere [[rule]] of the stronger). if these views are thus set out separately, the other views have no [[force]] or plausibility against the view that the superior in [[virtue]] ought to [[rule]], or be master. others, clinging, as they [[think]], simply to a [[principle]] of [[justice]] (for [[law]] and custom are a sort of justice), assume that [[slavery]] in accordance with the custom of [[war]] is justified by [[law]], but at the same moment they deny this. for what if the cause of the [[war]] be [[unjust]]? and again, no one would ever say he is a [[slave]] who is unworthy to be a [[slave]]. were this the case, [[men]] of the highest rank would be slaves [[slave]] and the [[children]] of slaves [[slave]] if they or their parents [[chance]] to have been taken captive and sold. wherefore hellenes do not like to call hellenes slaves [[slave]], but confine the term to barbarians. yet, in using this [[language]], they really mean the [[natural]] [[slave]] of whom we spoke at first; for it must be admitted that some are slaves [[slave]] everywhere, others nowhere. the same [[principle]] applies to nobility. hellenes regard themselves as [[noble]] everywhere, and not only in their own [[country]], but they deem the barbarians [[noble]] only when at [[home]], thereby implying that there are two sorts of nobility and [[freedom]], the one absolute, the other relative. the helen of theodectes says: 

"who would presume to call me servant who am on both sides sprung from the stem of the gods? "

what does this mean but that they distinguish [[freedom]] and [[slavery]], [[noble]] and humble birth, by the two principles [[principle]] of [[good]] and [[evil]]? they [[think]] that as [[men]] and animals beget [[men]] and animals, so from [[good]] [[men]] a [[good]] [[man]] springs. but this is what [[nature]], though she may intend it, cannot always accomplish. 

we see then that there is some foundation for this difference of [[opinion]], and that all are not either slaves [[slave]] by [[nature]] or freemen by [[nature]], and also that there is in some cases a marked distinction between the two classes, rendering it expedient and [[right]] for the one to be slaves [[slave]] and the others to be masters: the one practicing [[obedience]], the others exercising the [[authority]] and lordship which [[nature]] intended them to have. the [[abuse]] of this [[authority]] is injurious to both; for the interests of part and whole, of [[body]] and [[soul]], are the same, and the [[slave]] is a part of the master, a living but separated part of his bodily frame. hence, where the relation of master and [[slave]] between them is [[natural]] they are [[friends]] and have a [[common]] interest, but where it rests merely on [[law]] and [[force]] the reverse is true. 

part vii 

the previous remarks are quite enough to show that the [[rule]] of a master is not a constitutional [[rule]], and that all the different kinds [[kind]] of [[rule]] are not, as some affirm, the same with each other. for there is one [[rule]] exercised over subjects [[subject]] who are by [[nature]] [[free]], another over subjects [[subject]] who are by [[nature]] slaves [[slave]]. the [[rule]] of a household is a [[monarchy]], for every house is under one head: whereas constitutional [[rule]] is a [[government]] of freemen and equals [[equal]]. the master is not called a master because he has [[science]], but because he is of a [[certain]] [[character]], and the same remark applies to the [[slave]] and the freeman. still there may be a [[science]] for the master and [[science]] for the [[slave]]. the [[science]] of the [[slave]] would be such as the [[man]] of syracuse taught, who made [[money]] by instructing slaves [[slave]] in their ordinary duties [[duty]]. and such a [[knowledge]] may be carried further, so as to include cookery and similar menial [[arts]]. for some duties [[duty]] are of the more necessary, others of the more honorable sort; as the proverb says, 'slave before [[slave]], master before master.' but all such branches of [[knowledge]] are servile. there is likewise a [[science]] of the master, which teaches [[teach]] the use of slaves [[slave]]; for the master as such is concerned, not with the acquisition, but with the use of them. yet this so-called [[science]] is not anything [[great]] or wonderful; for the master need only [[know]] how to order that which the [[slave]] must [[know]] how to execute. hence those who are in a position which places them above toil have stewards who attend to their households while they occupy themselves with [[philosophy]] or with [[politics]]. but the art [[arts]] of acquiring slaves [[slave]], i mean of justly acquiring them, differs both from the art [[arts]] of the master and the art [[arts]] of the [[slave]], being a [[species]] of hunting or [[war]]. enough of the distinction between master and [[slave]]. 

part viii 

let us now inquire into [[property]] generally, and into the art [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]], in accordance with our usual method, for a [[slave]] has been shown to be a part of [[property]]. the first [[question]] is whether the art [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]] is the same with the art [[arts]] of managing a household or a part of it, or instrumental to it; and if the [[last]], whether in the way that the art [[arts]] of making shuttles is instrumental to the art [[arts]] of weaving, or in the way that the casting of bronze is instrumental to the art [[arts]] of the statuary, for they are not instrumental in the same way, but the one provides tools and the other material; and by material i mean the substratum out of which any [[work]] is made; thus wool is the material of the weaver, bronze of the statuary. now it is easy to see that the art [[arts]] of household management is not identical with the art [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]], for the one uses the material which the other provides. for the art [[arts]] which uses household stores can be no other than the art [[arts]] of household management. there is, however, a [[doubt]] whether the art [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]] is a part of household management or a distinct art [[arts]]. if the getter of [[wealth]] has to consider whence [[wealth]] and [[property]] can be procured, but there are many sorts of [[property]] and riches [[rich]], then are husbandry, and the [[care]] and provision of food in general, parts of the wealth-getting art [[arts]] or distinct [[arts]]? again, there are many sorts of food, and therefore there are many kinds [[kind]] of lives [[life]] both of animals and [[men]]; they must all have food, and the differences in their food have made differences in their ways of [[life]]. for of beasts, some are gregarious, others are solitary; they [[live]] in the way which is [[best]] adapted to sustain them, accordingly as they are carnivorous or herbivorous or omnivorous: and their habits are determined for them by [[nature]] in such a manner that they may obtain with greater facility the food of their [[choice]]. but, as different [[species]] have different tastes, the same things are not naturally pleasant to all of them; and therefore the lives [[life]] of carnivorous or herbivorous animals further differ among themselves. in the lives [[life]] of [[men]] too there is a [[great]] difference. the laziest are shepherds, who lead an idle [[life]], and get their subsistence without trouble from tame animals; their flocks having to wander from place to place in search of pasture, they are compelled to [[follow]] them, cultivating a sort of living farm. others support themselves by hunting, which is of different kinds [[kind]]. some, for [[example]], are brigands, others, who dwell near lakes or marshes or rivers or a sea in which there are fish, are fishermen, and others [[live]] by the pursuit of birds or wild beasts. the greater number obtain a living from the cultivated fruits of the soil. such are the modes of subsistence which prevail among those whose industry springs up of itself, and whose food is not acquired by exchange and retail trade- there is the shepherd, the husbandman, the brigand, the fisherman, the hunter. some gain a comfortable maintenance out of two employments, eking out the deficiencies of one of them by another: thus the [[life]] of a shepherd may be combined with that of a brigand, the [[life]] of a [[farmer]] with that of a hunter. other modes of [[life]] are similarly combined in any way which the needs of [[men]] may require. [[property]], in the sense of a bare livelihood, seems to be given by [[nature]] herself to all, both when they are first born, and when they are grown up. for some animals bring forth, together with their offspring, so much food as will [[last]] until they are able to supply themselves; of this the vermiparous or oviparous animals are an instance; and the viviparous animals have up to a [[certain]] [[time]] a supply of food for their [[young]] in themselves, which is called milk. in like manner we may infer that, after the birth of animals, plants [[exist]] for their sake, and that the other animals [[exist]] for the sake of [[man]], the tame for use and food, the wild, if not all at least the greater part of them, for food, and for the provision of clothing and various instruments. now if [[nature]] makes nothing incomplete, and nothing in [[vain]], the inference must be that she has made all animals for the sake of [[man]]. and so, in one point of view, the art [[arts]] of [[war]] is a [[natural]] art [[arts]] of acquisition, for the art [[arts]] of acquisition includes hunting, an art [[arts]] which we ought to practice against wild beasts, and against [[men]] who, though intended by [[nature]] to be governed, will not submit; for [[war]] of such a [[kind]] is naturally just. 

of the art [[arts]] of acquisition then there is one [[kind]] which by [[nature]] is a part of the management of a household, in so far as the art [[arts]] of household management must either find ready to hand, or itself provide, such things necessary to [[life]], and useful for the [[community]] of the [[family]] or [[state]], as can be stored. they are the elements of true riches [[rich]]; for the amount of [[property]] which is needed for a [[good]] [[life]] is not unlimited, although solon in one of his poems says that 

"no bound to riches [[rich]] has been fixed for [[man]]. "

but there is a boundary fixed, just as there is in the other [[arts]]; for the instruments of any art [[arts]] are never unlimited, either in number or size, and riches [[rich]] may be defined as a number of instruments to be used in a household or in a [[state]]. and so we see that there is a [[natural]] art [[arts]] of acquisition which is practiced by managers of households and by statesmen, and what is the [[reason]] of this. 

part ix 

there is another variety of the art [[arts]] of acquisition which is commonly and rightly called an art [[arts]] of wealth-getting, and has in [[fact]] suggested the notion that riches [[rich]] and [[property]] have no limit. being nearly connected with the preceding, it is often identified with it. but though they are not very different, neither are they the same. the [[kind]] already described is given by [[nature]], the other is gained by [[experience]] and art [[arts]]. 

let us begin our discussion of the [[question]] with the following considerations: 

of everything which we possess there are two uses: both belong to the thing as such, but not in the same manner, for one is the proper, and the other the improper or secondary use of it. for [[example]], a shoe is used for wear, and is used for exchange; both are uses of the shoe. he who gives a shoe in exchange for [[money]] or food to him who wants one, does indeed use the shoe as a shoe, but this is not its proper or primary [[purpose]], for a shoe is not made to be an object of barter. the same may be said of all possessions, for the art [[arts]] of exchange extends to all of them, and it arises at first from what is [[natural]], from the circumstance that some have too little, others too much. hence we may infer that retail [[trade]] is not a [[natural]] part of the art [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]]; had it been so, [[men]] would have ceased to exchange when they had enough. in the first [[community]], indeed, which is the [[family]], this art [[arts]] is obviously of no use, but it begins to be useful when the [[society]] increases. for the members of the [[family]] originally had all things in [[common]]; later, when the [[family]] divided into parts, the parts shared in many things, and different parts in different things, which they had to give in exchange for what they wanted, a [[kind]] of barter which is still practiced among barbarous nations who exchange with one another the necessaries of [[life]] and nothing more; giving and receiving wine, for [[example]], in exchange for coin, and the like. this sort of barter is not part of the wealth-getting art [[arts]] and is not contrary to [[nature]], but is needed for the satisfaction of men's [[natural]] wants. the other or more complex form of exchange grew, as might have been inferred, out of the simpler. when the inhabitants of one [[country]] became more dependent on those of another, and they imported what they needed, and exported what they had too much of, [[money]] necessarily came into use. for the various necessaries of [[life]] are not easily carried about, and hence [[men]] agreed to employ in their dealings with each other something which was intrinsically useful and easily applicable to the purposes [[purpose]] of [[life]], for [[example]], iron, silver, and the like. of this the value was at first measured simply by size and weight, but in process of [[time]] they put a stamp upon it, to save the trouble of weighing and to mark the value. 

when the use of coin had once been discovered, out of the barter of necessary articles arose the other art [[arts]] of [[wealth]] getting, namely, retail [[trade]]; which was at first probably a simple matter, but became more complicated as soon as [[men]] learned by [[experience]] whence and by what exchanges the [[greatest]] [[profit]] might be made. originating in the use of coin, the art [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]] is generally [[thought]] to be chiefly concerned with it, and to be the art [[arts]] which produces [[produce]] riches [[rich]] and [[wealth]]; having to consider how they may be accumulated. indeed, riches [[rich]] is assumed by many to be only a quantity of coin, because the [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]] and retail [[trade]] are concerned with coin. others maintain that coined [[money]] is a mere sham, a thing not [[natural]], but conventional only, because, if the users substitute another commodity for it, it is worthless, and because it is not useful as a means to any of the necessities of [[life]], and, indeed, he who is [[rich]] in coin may often be in want of necessary food. but how can that be [[wealth]] of which a [[man]] may have a [[great]] abundance and yet perish with [[hunger]], like midas in the fable, whose insatiable prayer turned everything that was set before him into gold? 

hence [[men]] seek after a [[better]] notion of riches [[rich]] and of the art [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]] than the mere acquisition of coin, and they are [[right]]. for [[natural]] riches [[rich]] and the [[natural]] art [[arts]] of wealth-getting are a different thing; in their true form they are part of the management of a household; whereas retail [[trade]] is the art [[arts]] of producing [[wealth]], not in every way, but by exchange. and it is [[thought]] to be concerned with coin; for coin is the unit of exchange and the measure or limit of it. and there is no bound to the riches [[rich]] which spring from this art [[arts]] of [[wealth]] getting. as in the art [[arts]] of medicine there is no limit to the pursuit of health, and as in the other [[arts]] there is no limit to the pursuit of their several ends, for they aim at accomplishing their ends to the uttermost (but of the means there is a limit, for the end is always the limit), so, too, in this art [[arts]] of wealth-getting there is no limit of the end, which is riches [[rich]] of the spurious [[kind]], and the acquisition of [[wealth]]. but the art [[arts]] of wealth-getting which consists in household management, on the other hand, has a limit; the unlimited acquisition of [[wealth]] is not its [[business]]. and, therefore, in one point of view, all riches [[rich]] must have a limit; nevertheless, as a matter of [[fact]], we find the opposite to be the case; for all getters of [[wealth]] increase their hoard of coin without limit. the source of the confusion is the near connection between the two kinds [[kind]] of wealth-getting; in either, the instrument is the same, although the use is different, and so they pass into one another; for each is a use of the same [[property]], but with a difference: accumulation is the end in the one case, but there is a further end in the other. hence some persons [[person]] are [[led]] to [[believe]] that getting [[wealth]] is the object of household management, and the whole [[idea]] of their lives [[life]] is that they ought either to increase their [[money]] without limit, or at any rate not to lose it. the origin of this disposition in [[men]] is that they are intent upon living only, and not upon living well; and, as their desires [[desire]] are unlimited they also [[desire]] that the means of gratifying them should be without limit. those who do aim at a [[good]] [[life]] seek the means of obtaining bodily pleasures [[pleasure]]; and, since the enjoyment of these appears to depend on [[property]], they are absorbed in getting [[wealth]]: and so there arises the second [[species]] of wealth-getting. for, as their enjoyment is in excess, they seek an art [[arts]] which produces [[produce]] the excess of enjoyment; and, if they are not able to supply their pleasures [[pleasure]] by the art [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]], they try other [[arts]], using in turn every faculty in a manner contrary to [[nature]]. the quality of [[courage]], for [[example]], is not intended to make [[wealth]], but to inspire confidence; neither is this the aim of the general's or of the physician's art [[arts]]; but the one aims at [[victory]] and the other at health. nevertheless, some [[men]] turn every quality or art [[arts]] into a means of getting [[wealth]]; this they conceive to be the end, and to the promotion of the end they [[think]] all things must contribute. 

thus, then, we have considered the art [[arts]] of wealth-getting which is unnecessary, and why [[men]] want it; and also the necessary art [[arts]] of wealth-getting, which we have seen to be different from the other, and to be a [[natural]] part of the art [[arts]] of managing a household, concerned with the provision of food, not, however, like the former [[kind]], unlimited, but having a limit. 

part x 

and we have found the [[answer]] to our original [[question]], whether the art [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]] is the [[business]] of the manager of a household and of the statesman or not their [[business]]? viz., that [[wealth]] is presupposed by them. for as [[political]] [[science]] does not make [[men]], but takes them from [[nature]] and uses them, so too [[nature]] provides them with [[earth]] or sea or the like as a source of food. at this stage begins the [[duty]] of the manager of a household, who has to order the things which [[nature]] supplies; he may be compared to the weaver who has not to make but to use wool, and to [[know]], too, what sort of wool is [[good]] and serviceable or [[bad]] and unserviceable. were this otherwise, it would be difficult to see why the art [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]] is a part of the management of a household and the art [[arts]] of medicine not; for surely the members of a household must have health just as they must have [[life]] or any other necessary. the [[answer]] is that as from one point of view the master of the house and the ruler of the [[state]] have to consider about health, from another point of view not they but the physician; so in one way the art [[arts]] of household management, in another way the subordinate art [[arts]], has to consider about [[wealth]]. but, strictly speaking, as i have already said, the means of [[life]] must be provided beforehand by [[nature]]; for the [[business]] of [[nature]] is to furnish food to that which is born, and the food of the offspring is always what remains over of that from which it is produced. wherefore the art [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]] out of fruits and animals is always [[natural]]. 

there are two sorts of wealth-getting, as i have said; one is a part of household management, the other is retail [[trade]]: the former necessary and honorable, while that which consists in exchange is justly censured; for it is unnatural, and a mode by which [[men]] gain from one another. the most hated sort, and with the [[greatest]] [[reason]], is usury, which makes a gain out of [[money]] itself, and not from the [[natural]] object of it. for [[money]] was intended to be used in exchange, but not to increase at interest. and this term interest, which means the birth of [[money]] from [[money]], is applied to the breeding of [[money]] because the offspring resembles the parent. wherefore of an modes of getting [[wealth]] this is the most unnatural. 

part xi 

enough has been said about the theory of wealth-getting; we will now proceed to the practical part. the discussion of such matters is not unworthy of [[philosophy]], but to be engaged in them practically is illiberal and irksome. the useful parts of wealth-getting are, first, the [[knowledge]] of livestock- which are most profitable, and where, and how- as, for [[example]], what sort of horses or sheep or oxen or any other animals are most likely to give a return. a [[man]] ought to [[know]] which of these [[pay]] [[better]] than others, and which [[pay]] [[best]] in particular places, for some do [[better]] in one place and some in another. secondly, husbandry, which may be either tillage or planting, and the keeping of bees and of fish, or fowl, or of any animals which may be useful to [[man]]. these are the divisions of the true or proper art [[arts]] of wealth-getting and come first. of the other, which consists in exchange, the first and most important division is commerce (of which there are three kinds- the provision of a ship, the conveyance of goods [[good]], exposure for sale- these again differing as they are safer or more profitable), the second is usury, the third, service for hire- of this, one [[kind]] is employed in the mechanical [[arts]], the other in unskilled and bodily labor. there is still a third sort of [[wealth]] getting intermediate between this and the first or [[natural]] mode which is partly [[natural]], but is also concerned with exchange, viz., the industries that make their [[profit]] from the [[earth]], and from things growing from the [[earth]] which, although they bear no fruit, are nevertheless profitable; for [[example]], the cutting of timber and all mining. the art [[arts]] of mining, by which minerals are obtained, itself has many branches, for there are various kinds [[kind]] of things dug out of the [[earth]]. of the several divisions of wealth-getting i now speak generally; a minute consideration of them might be useful in practice, but it would be tiresome to dwell upon them at greater length now. 

those occupations are most truly [[arts]] in which there is the least element of [[chance]]; they are the meanest in which the [[body]] is most deteriorated, the most servile in which there is the [[greatest]] use of the [[body]], and the most illiberal in which there is the least need of excellence. 

works have been written upon these subjects [[subject]] by various persons [[person]]; for [[example]], by chares the parian, and apollodorus the lemnian, who have treated of tillage and planting, while others have treated of other branches; any one who cares [[care]] for such matters may refer to their writings. it would be well also to collect the scattered stories of the ways in which individuals [[individual]] have succeeded in amassing a [[fortune]]; for all this is useful to persons [[person]] who value the art [[arts]] of getting [[wealth]]. there is the anecdote of thales the milesian and his financial device, which involves a [[principle]] of universal application, but is attributed to him on account of his [[reputation]] for [[wisdom]]. he was reproached for his [[poverty]], which was supposed to show that [[philosophy]] was of no use. according to the story, he knew by his [[skill]] in the stars while it was yet winter that there would be a [[great]] harvest of olives in the coming year; so, having a little [[money]], he gave deposits for the use of all the olive-presses in chios and miletus, which he hired at a low price because no one bid against him. when the harvest-time came, and many were wanted all at once and of a sudden, he let them out at any rate which he pleased, and made a quantity of [[money]]. thus he showed the [[world]] that [[philosophers]] can easily be [[rich]] if they like, but that their [[ambition]] is of another sort. he is supposed to have given a striking proof of his [[wisdom]], but, as i was saying, his device for getting [[wealth]] is of universal application, and is nothing but the creation of a [[monopoly]]. it is an art [[arts]] often practiced by cities [[city]] when they are want of [[money]]; they make a [[monopoly]] of provisions. 

there was a [[man]] of sicily, who, having [[money]] deposited with him, bought up an the iron from the iron mines; afterwards, when the merchants from their various markets came to buy, he was the only seller, and without much increasing the price he gained 200 per cent. which when dionysius heard, he told him that he might take away his [[money]], but that he must not remain at syracuse, for he [[thought]] that the [[man]] had discovered a way of making [[money]] which was injurious to his own interests. he made the same discovery as thales; they both contrived to create a [[monopoly]] for themselves. and statesmen as well ought to [[know]] these things; for a [[state]] is often as much in want of [[money]] and of such devices for obtaining it as a household, or even more so; hence some [[public]] [[men]] devote themselves entirely to finance. 

part xii 

of household management we have seen that there are three parts- one is the [[rule]] of a master over slaves [[slave]], which has been discussed already, another of a [[father]], and the third of a husband. a husband and [[father]], we saw, rules [[rule]] over [[wife]] and [[children]], both [[free]], but the [[rule]] differs, the [[rule]] over his [[children]] being a [[royal]], over his [[wife]] a constitutional [[rule]]. for although there may be exceptions to the order of [[nature]], the male is by [[nature]] fitter for command than the female, just as the elder and full-grown is superior to the younger and more immature. but in most constitutional states the [[citizens]] [[rule]] and are ruled by turns, for the [[idea]] of a constitutional [[state]] implies that the natures [[nature]] of the [[citizens]] are [[equal]], and do not differ at all. nevertheless, when one rules [[rule]] and the other is ruled we endeavor to create a difference of outward forms and names and titles of [[respect]], which may be illustrated by the saying of amasis about his foot-pan. the relation of the male to the female is of this [[kind]], but there the inequality is permanent. the [[rule]] of a [[father]] over his [[children]] is [[royal]], for he rules [[rule]] by [[virtue]] both of [[love]] and of the [[respect]] due to [[age]], exercising a [[kind]] of [[royal]] [[power]]. and therefore [[homer]] has appropriately called [[zeus]] 'father of gods and [[men]],' because he is the [[king]] of them all. for a [[king]] is the [[natural]] superior of his subjects [[subject]], but he should be of the same kin or [[kind]] with them, and such is the relation of elder and younger, of [[father]] and [[son]]. 

part xiii 

thus it is clear that household management attends more to [[men]] than to the acquisition of inanimate things, and to [[human]] excellence more than to the excellence of [[property]] which we call [[wealth]], and to the [[virtue]] of freemen more than to the [[virtue]] of slaves [[slave]]. a [[question]] may indeed be raised, whether there is any excellence at all in a [[slave]] beyond and higher than merely instrumental and ministerial qualities- whether he can have the virtues [[virtue]] of temperance, [[courage]], [[justice]], and the like; or whether slaves [[slave]] possess only bodily and ministerial qualities. and, whichever way we [[answer]] the [[question]], a difficulty arises; for, if they have [[virtue]], in what will they differ from freemen? on the other hand, since they are [[men]] and share in [[rational]] [[principle]], it seems absurd to say that they have no [[virtue]]. a similar [[question]] may be raised about [[women]] and [[children]], whether they too have virtues [[virtue]]: ought a woman to be temperate and brave and just, and is a child to be called temperate, and intemperate, or note so in general we may ask about the [[natural]] ruler, and the [[natural]] [[subject]], whether they have the same or different virtues [[virtue]]. for if a [[noble]] [[nature]] is equally required in both, why should one of them always [[rule]], and the other always be ruled? nor can we say that this is a [[question]] of [[degree]], for the difference between ruler and [[subject]] is a difference of [[kind]], which the difference of more and less never is. yet how [[strange]] is the supposition that the one ought, and that the other ought not, to have virtue! for if the ruler is intemperate and [[unjust]], how can he [[rule]] well? if the [[subject]], how can he obey well? if he be licentious and cowardly, he will certainly not do his [[duty]]. it is evident, therefore, that both of them must have a share of [[virtue]], but varying as [[natural]] subjects [[subject]] also vary among themselves. here the very [[constitution]] of the [[soul]] has shown us the way; in it one part naturally rules [[rule]], and the other is [[subject]], and the [[virtue]] of the ruler we in maintain to be different from that of the [[subject]]; the one being the [[virtue]] of the [[rational]], and the other of the irrational part. now, it is obvious that the same [[principle]] applies generally, and therefore almost all things [[rule]] and are ruled according to [[nature]]. but the [[kind]] of [[rule]] differs; the freeman rules [[rule]] over the [[slave]] after another manner from that in which the male rules [[rule]] over the female, or the [[man]] over the child; although the parts of the [[soul]] are [[present]] in an of them, they are [[present]] in different degrees [[degree]]. for the [[slave]] has no deliberative faculty at all; the woman has, but it is without [[authority]], and the child has, but it is immature. so it must necessarily be supposed to be with the [[moral]] virtues [[virtue]] also; all should partake of them, but only in such manner and [[degree]] as is required by each for the fulfillment of his [[duty]]. hence the ruler ought to have [[moral]] [[virtue]] in [[perfection]], for his function, taken absolutely, demands a master artificer, and [[rational]] [[principle]] is such an artificer; the subjects [[subject]], [[oil]] the other hand, require only that measure of [[virtue]] which is proper to each of them. clearly, then, [[moral]] [[virtue]] belongs to all of them; but the temperance of a [[man]] and of a woman, or the [[courage]] and [[justice]] of a [[man]] and of a woman, are not, as [[socrates]] maintained, the same; the [[courage]] of a [[man]] is shown in commanding, of a woman in obeying. and this holds of all other virtues [[virtue]], as will be more clearly seen if we look at them in detail, for those who say generally that [[virtue]] consists in a [[good]] disposition of the [[soul]], or in doing rightly, or the like, only [[deceive]] themselves. far [[better]] than such definitions is their mode of speaking, who, like gorgias, enumerate the virtues [[virtue]]. all classes must be deemed to have their special attributes; as the poet says of [[women]], 

"silence is a woman's [[glory]], "

but this is not equally the [[glory]] of [[man]]. the child is imperfect, and therefore obviously his [[virtue]] is not relative to himself alone, but to the [[perfect]] [[man]] and to his teacher, and in like manner the [[virtue]] of the [[slave]] is relative to a master. now we determined that a [[slave]] is useful for the wants of [[life]], and therefore he will obviously require only so much [[virtue]] as will prevent him from failing in his [[duty]] through cowardice or lack of self-control. some one will ask whether, if what we are saying is true, [[virtue]] will not be required also in the artisans, for they often fail in their [[work]] through the lack of [[self]] control? but is there not a [[great]] difference in the two cases? for the [[slave]] shares in his master's [[life]]; the artisan is less closely connected with him, and only attains excellence in proportion as he becomes a [[slave]]. the meaner sort of mechanic has a special and separate [[slavery]]; and whereas the [[slave]] exists by [[nature]], not so the shoemaker or other artisan. it is manifest, then, that the master ought to be the source of such excellence in the [[slave]], and not a mere possessor of the art [[arts]] of mastership which trains the [[slave]] in his duties [[duty]]. wherefore they are mistaken who forbid us to converse with slaves [[slave]] and say that we should employ command only, for slaves [[slave]] stand even more in need of admonition than [[children]]. 

so much for this [[subject]]; the relations of husband and [[wife]], parent and child, their several virtues [[virtue]], what in their intercourse with one another is [[good]], and what is [[evil]], and how we may pursue the [[good]] and [[good]] and escape the [[evil]], will have to be discussed when we speak of the different forms of [[government]]. for, inasmuch as every [[family]] is a part of a [[state]], and these relationships are the parts of a [[family]], and the [[virtue]] of the part must have regard to the [[virtue]] of the whole, [[women]] and [[children]] must be trained by [[education]] with an eye to the [[constitution]], if the virtues [[virtue]] of either of them are supposed to make any difference in the virtues [[virtue]] of the [[state]]. and they must make a difference: for the [[children]] grow up to be [[citizens]], and half the [[free]] persons [[person]] in a [[state]] are [[women]]. 

of these matters, enough has been said; of what remains, let us speak at another [[time]]. regarding, then, our [[present]] inquiry as complete, we will make a new beginning. and, first, let us examine the various theories of a [[perfect]] [[state]].




book two	   go to next

part i 

our urpose is to consider what form of [[political]] [[community]] is [[best]] of all for those who are most able to realize their ideal of [[life]]. we must therefore examine not only this but other constitutions [[constitution]], both such as actually [[exist]] in well-governed states, and any theoretical forms which are held in esteem; that what is [[good]] and useful may be brought to [[light]]. and let no one suppose that in seeking for something beyond them we are anxious to make a sophistical display at any cost; we only undertake this inquiry because all the constitutions [[constitution]] with which we are acquainted are faulty. 

we will begin with the [[natural]] beginning of the [[subject]]. three alternatives are conceivable: the members of a [[state]] must either have (1) all things or (2) nothing in [[common]], or (3) some things in [[common]] and some not. that they should have nothing in [[common]] is clearly impossible, for the [[constitution]] is a [[community]], and must at any rate have a [[common]] place- one [[city]] will be in one place, and the [[citizens]] are those who share in that one [[city]]. but should a well ordered [[state]] have all things, as far as may be, in [[common]], or some only and not others? for the [[citizens]] might conceivably have wives [[wife]] and [[children]] and [[property]] in [[common]], as [[socrates]] proposes in the [[republic]] of [[plato]]. which is [[better]], our [[present]] condition, or the proposed new order of [[society]]. 

part ii 

there are many difficulties in the [[community]] of [[women]]. and the [[principle]] on which [[socrates]] rests the necessity of such an institution evidently is not established by his arguments. further, as a means to the end which he ascribes to the [[state]], the scheme, taken literally is impracticable, and how we are to interpret it is nowhere precisely stated. i am speaking of the premise from which the argument of [[socrates]] proceeds, 'that the greater the unity of the [[state]] the [[better]].' is it not obvious that a [[state]] may at length attain such a [[degree]] of unity as to be no longer a [[state]]? since the [[nature]] of a [[state]] is to be a plurality, and in tending to greater unity, from being a [[state]], it becomes a [[family]], and from being a [[family]], an [[individual]]; for the [[family]] may be said to be more than the [[state]], and the [[individual]] than the [[family]]. so that we ought not to attain this [[greatest]] unity even if we could, for it would be the destruction of the [[state]]. again, a [[state]] is not made up only of so many [[men]], but of different kinds [[kind]] of [[men]]; for similars do not constitute a [[state]]. it is not like a [[military]] [[alliance]] the usefulness of the latter depends upon its quantity even where there is no difference in quality (for mutual protection is the end aimed at), just as a greater weight of anything is more useful than a less (in like manner, a [[state]] differs from a nation, when the nation has not its [[population]] organized in villages, but lives [[life]] an arcadian sort of life); but the elements out of which a unity is to be formed differ in [[kind]]. wherefore the [[principle]] of compensation, as i have already remarked in the ethics, is the salvation of states. even among freemen and equals [[equal]] this is a [[principle]] which must be maintained, for they cannot an [[rule]] together, but must [[change]] at the end of a year or some other period of [[time]] or in some order of succession. the result is that upon this plan they all govern; just as if shoemakers and carpenters were to exchange their occupations, and the same persons [[person]] did not always continue shoemakers and carpenters. and since it is [[better]] that this should be so in [[politics]] as well, it is clear that while there should be continuance of the same persons [[person]] in [[power]] where this is possible, yet where this is not possible by [[reason]] of the [[natural]] equality of the [[citizens]], and at the same [[time]] it is just that an should share in the [[government]] (whether to govern be a [[good]] thing or a bad), an approximation to this is that equals [[equal]] should in turn retire from office and should, apart from official position, be treated alike. thus the one party [[rule]] and the others are ruled in turn, as if they were no longer the same persons [[person]]. in like manner when they hold office there is a variety in the offices held. hence it is evident that a [[city]] is not by [[nature]] one in that sense which some persons [[person]] affirm; and that what is said to be the [[greatest]] [[good]] of cities [[city]] is in reality their destruction; but surely the [[good]] of things must be that which preserves them. again, in another point of view, this extreme unification of the [[state]] is clearly not [[good]]; for a [[family]] is more self-sufficing than an [[individual]], and a [[city]] than a [[family]], and a [[city]] only comes into being when the [[community]] is large enough to be self-sufficing. if then self-sufficiency is to be [[desired]], the lesser [[degree]] of unity is more desirable than the greater. 

part iii 

but, even supposing that it were [[best]] for the [[community]] to have the [[greatest]] [[degree]] of unity, this unity is by no means proved to [[follow]] from the [[fact]] 'of all [[men]] saying "mine" and "not mine" at the same instant of [[time]],' which, according to [[socrates]], is the sign of [[perfect]] unity in a [[state]]. for the word 'all' is ambiguous. if the meaning be that every [[individual]] says 'mine' and 'not mine' at the same [[time]], then perhaps the result at which [[socrates]] aims may be in some [[degree]] accomplished; each [[man]] will call the same [[person]] his own [[son]] and the same [[person]] his [[wife]], and so of his [[property]] and of all that falls to his lot. this, however, is not the way in which [[people]] would speak who had their had their wives [[wife]] and [[children]] in [[common]]; they would say 'all' but not 'each.' in like manner their [[property]] would be described as belonging to them, not severally but collectively. there is an obvious fallacy in the term 'all': like some other words, 'both,' 'odd,' 'even,' it is ambiguous, and even in abstract argument becomes a source of logical puzzles. that all persons [[person]] call the same thing mine in the sense in which each does so may be a fine thing, but it is impracticable; or if the words are taken in the other sense, such a unity in no way conduces to harmony. and there is another objection to the proposal. for that which is [[common]] to the [[greatest]] number has the least [[care]] bestowed upon it. every one thinks [[think]] chiefly of his own, hardly at all of the [[common]] interest; and only when he is himself concerned as an [[individual]]. for besides other considerations, everybody is more inclined to neglect the [[duty]] which he expects another to fulfill; as in families [[family]] many attendants are often less useful than a few. each citizen will have a thousand sons [[son]] who will not be his sons [[son]] individually but anybody will be equally the [[son]] of anybody, and will therefore be neglected by all alike. further, upon this [[principle]], every one will use the word 'mine' of one who is prospering or the reverse, however small a fraction he may himself be of the whole number; the same boy will be 'so and so's [[son]],' the [[son]] of each of the thousand, or whatever be the number of the [[citizens]]; and even about this he will not be positive; for it is impossible to [[know]] who chanced to have a child, or whether, if one came into existence, it has survived. but which is better- for each to say 'mine' in this way, making a [[man]] the same relation to two thousand or ten thousand [[citizens]], or to use the word 'mine' in the ordinary and more restricted sense? for usually the same [[person]] is called by one [[man]] his own [[son]] whom another calls his own [[brother]] or cousin or kinsman- [[blood]] relation or connection by [[marriage]] either of himself or of some relation of his, and yet another his clansman or tribesman; and how much [[better]] is it to be the real cousin of somebody than to be a [[son]] after plato's fashion! nor is there any way of preventing brothers [[brother]] and [[children]] and fathers [[father]] and mothers [[mother]] from sometimes recognizing one another; for [[children]] are born like their parents, and they will necessarily be finding indications of their relationship to one another. geographers declare such to be the [[fact]]; they say that in part of upper libya, where the [[women]] are [[common]], nevertheless the [[children]] who are born are assigned to their respective fathers [[father]] on the ground of their likeness. and some [[women]], like the females of other animals- for [[example]], mares and cows- have a [[strong]] tendency to [[produce]] offspring resembling their parents, as was the case with the pharsalian mare called honest.

other evils [[evil]], against which it is not easy for the authors of such a [[community]] to guard, will be assaults and homicides, voluntary as well as involuntary, quarrels and slanders, all which are most unholy acts when committed against fathers [[father]] and mothers [[mother]] and near relations, but not equally unholy when there is no relationship. moreover, they are much more likely to occur if the relationship is unknown, and, when they have occurred, the customary expiations of them cannot be made. again, how [[strange]] it is that [[socrates]], after having made the [[children]] [[common]], should hinder lovers from carnal intercourse only, but should permit [[love]] and familiarities between [[father]] and [[son]] or between [[brother]] and [[brother]], than which nothing can be more unseemly, since even without them [[love]] of this sort is improper. how [[strange]], too, to forbid intercourse for no other [[reason]] than the [[violence]] of the [[pleasure]], as though the relationship of [[father]] and [[son]] or of brothers [[brother]] with one another made no difference. 

this [[community]] of wives [[wife]] and [[children]] seems [[better]] suited to the husbandmen than to the guardians, for if they have wives [[wife]] and [[children]] in [[common]], they will be bound to one another by weaker ties, as a [[subject]] class should be, and they will remain [[obedient]] and not rebel. in a word, the result of such a [[law]] would be just the opposite of which [[good]] laws [[law]] ought to have, and the intention of [[socrates]] in making these regulations about [[women]] and [[children]] would defeat itself. for [[friendship]] we [[believe]] to be the [[greatest]] [[good]] of states and the preservative of them against revolutions [[revolution]]; neither is there anything which [[socrates]] so greatly lauds as the unity of the [[state]] which he and all the [[world]] declare to be created by [[friendship]]. but the unity which he commends would be like that of the lovers in the symposium, who, as aristophanes says, [[desire]] to grow together in the excess of their affection, and from being two to become one, in which case one or both would certainly perish. whereas in a [[state]] having [[women]] and [[children]] [[common]], [[love]] will be watery; and the [[father]] will certainly not say 'my [[son]],' or the [[son]] 'my [[father]].' as a little sweet wine mingled with a [[great]] deal of water is imperceptible in the mixture, so, in this sort of [[community]], the [[idea]] of relationship which is based upon these names will be lost; there is no [[reason]] why the so-called [[father]] should [[care]] about the [[son]], or the [[son]] about the [[father]], or brothers [[brother]] about one another. of the two qualities which chiefly inspire regard and affection- that a thing is your own and that it is your only one-neither can [[exist]] in such a [[state]] as this. 

again, the transfer of [[children]] as soon as they are born from the rank of husbandmen or of artisans to that of guardians, and from the rank of guardians into a lower rank, will be very difficult to arrange; the givers or transferrers cannot but [[know]] whom they are giving and transferring, and to whom. and the previously mentioned evils [[evil]], such as assaults, unlawful loves [[love]], homicides, will happen more often amongst those who are transferred to the lower classes, or who have a place assigned to them among the guardians; for they will no longer call the members of the class they have left brothers [[brother]], and [[children]], and fathers [[father]], and mothers [[mother]], and will not, therefore, be afraid of committing any crimes by [[reason]] of consanguinity. touching the [[community]] of wives [[wife]] and [[children]], let this be our conclusion. 

part v 

next let us consider what should be our arrangements about [[property]]: should the [[citizens]] of the [[perfect]] [[state]] have their possessions in [[common]] or not? this [[question]] may be discussed separately from the enactments about [[women]] and [[children]]. even supposing that the [[women]] and [[children]] belong to individuals [[individual]], according to the custom which is at [[present]] universal, may there not be an advantage in having and using possessions in [[common]]? three cases are possible: (1) the soil may be appropriated, but the [[produce]] may be thrown for consumption into the [[common]] stock; and this is the practice of some nations. or (2), the soil may be [[common]], and may be cultivated in [[common]], but the [[produce]] divided among individuals [[individual]] for their private use; this is a form of [[common]] [[property]] which is said to [[exist]] among [[certain]] barbarians. or (3), the soil and the [[produce]] may be alike [[common]]. 

when the husbandmen are not the owners, the case will be different and easier to deal with; but when they till the ground for themselves the [[question]] of ownership will give a [[world]] of trouble. if they do not share equally enjoyments and toils, those who labor much and get little will necessarily [[complain]] of those who labor little and receive or consume much. but indeed there is always a difficulty in [[men]] living together and having all [[human]] relations in [[common]], but especially in their having [[common]] [[property]]. the partnerships of fellow-travelers are an [[example]] to the point; for they generally fall out over everyday matters and quarrel about any trifle which turns up. so with servants: we are most able to take offense at those with whom we most we most frequently come into contact in daily [[life]]. 

these are only some of the disadvantages which attend the [[community]] of [[property]]; the [[present]] arrangement, if improved as it might be by [[good]] customs and laws [[law]], would be far [[better]], and would have the advantages of both systems [[system]]. [[property]] should be in a [[certain]] sense [[common]], but, as a general [[rule]], private; for, when everyone has a distinct interest, [[men]] will not [[complain]] of one another, and they will make more [[progress]], because every one will be attending to his own [[business]]. and yet by [[reason]] of goodness, and in [[respect]] of use, 'friends,' as the proverb says, 'will have all things [[common]].' even now there are traces of such a [[principle]], showing that it is not impracticable, but, in well-ordered states, exists already to a [[certain]] extent and may be carried further. for, although every [[man]] has his own [[property]], some things he will place at the disposal of his [[friends]], while of others he shares the use with them. the lacedaemonians, for [[example]], use one another's slaves [[slave]], and horses, and dogs, as if they were their own; and when they lack provisions on a [[journey]], they appropriate what they find in the fields throughout the [[country]]. it is clearly [[better]] that [[property]] should be private, but the use of it [[common]]; and the special [[business]] of the legislator is to create in [[men]] this benevolent disposition. again, how immeasurably greater is the [[pleasure]], when a [[man]] feels [[feel]] a thing to be his own; for surely the [[love]] of [[self]] is a feeling implanted by [[nature]] and not given in [[vain]], although selfishness is rightly censured; this, however, is not the mere [[love]] of [[self]], but the [[love]] of [[self]] in excess, like the miser's [[love]] of [[money]]; for all, or almost all, [[men]] [[love]] [[money]] and other such objects in a measure. and further, there is the [[greatest]] [[pleasure]] in doing a [[kindness]] or service to [[friends]] or guests or companions, which can only be rendered when a [[man]] has private [[property]]. these advantages are lost by excessive unification of the [[state]]. the exhibition of two virtues [[virtue]], besides, is visibly annihilated in such a [[state]]: first, temperance towards [[women]] (for it is an honorable action to abstain from another's [[wife]] for temperance' sake); secondly, liberality in the matter of [[property]]. no one, when [[men]] have all things in [[common]], will any longer set an [[example]] of liberality or do any liberal action; for liberality consists in the use which is made of [[property]]. 

such legislation may have a specious appearance of benevolence; [[men]] readily listen to it, and are easily induced to [[believe]] that in some wonderful manner everybody will become everybody's friend, especially when some one is heard denouncing the evils [[evil]] now existing in states, suits about contracts, convictions for perjury, flatteries of [[rich]] [[men]] and the like, which are said to arise out of the possession of private [[property]]. these evils [[evil]], however, are due to a very different cause- the wickedness of [[human]] [[nature]]. indeed, we see that there is much more quarrelling among those who have all things in [[common]], though there are not many of them when compared with the vast numbers who have private [[property]]. 

again, we ought to reckon, not only the evils [[evil]] from which the [[citizens]] will be saved, but also the advantages which they will lose. the [[life]] which they are to lead appears to be quite impracticable. the error of [[socrates]] must be attributed to the false notion of unity from which he starts. unity there should be, both of the [[family]] and of the [[state]], but in some respects [[respect]] only. for there is a point at which a [[state]] may attain such a [[degree]] of unity as to be no longer a [[state]], or at which, without actually ceasing to [[exist]], it will become an inferior [[state]], like harmony passing into unison, or rhythm which has been reduced to a [[single]] foot. the [[state]], as i was saying, is a plurality which should be [[united]] and made into a [[community]] by [[education]]; and it is [[strange]] that the author of a [[system]] of [[education]] which he thinks [[think]] will make the [[state]] [[virtuous]], should expect to improve his [[citizens]] by regulations of this sort, and not by [[philosophy]] or by customs and laws [[law]], like those which prevail at sparta and crete respecting [[common]] meals, whereby the legislator has made [[property]] [[common]]. let us [[remember]] that we should not disregard the [[experience]] of ages [[age]]; in the multitude of years these things, if they were [[good]], would certainly not have been unknown; for almost everything has been found out, although sometimes they are not put together; in other cases [[men]] do not use the [[knowledge]] which they have. [[great]] [[light]] would be thrown on this [[subject]] if we could see such a form of [[government]] in the actual process of construction; for the legislator could not form a [[state]] at all without distributing and dividing its constituents into associations for [[common]] meals, and into phratries and tribes. but all this legislation ends only in forbidding agriculture to the guardians, a prohibition which the lacedaemonians try to enforce already. 

but, indeed, [[socrates]] has not said, nor is it easy to decide, what in such a [[community]] will be the general form of the [[state]]. the [[citizens]] who are not guardians are the majority, and about them nothing has been determined: are the husbandmen, too, to have their [[property]] in [[common]]? or is each [[individual]] to have his own? and are the wives [[wife]] and [[children]] to be [[individual]] or [[common]]. if, like the guardians, they are to have all things in [[common]], what do they differ from them, or what will they gain by submitting to their [[government]]? or, upon what [[principle]] would they submit, unless indeed the governing class adopt the ingenious policy of the cretans, who give their slaves [[slave]] the same [[institutions]] as their own, but forbid them gymnastic exercises and the possession of arms. if, on the other hand, the inferior classes are to be like other cities [[city]] in [[respect]] of [[marriage]] and [[property]], what will be the form of the [[community]]? must it not contain two states in one, each hostile to the other he makes the guardians into a mere occupying garrison, while the husbandmen and artisans and the rest are the real [[citizens]]. but if so the suits and quarrels, and all the evils [[evil]] which [[socrates]] affirms to [[exist]] in other states, will [[exist]] equally among them. he says indeed that, having so [[good]] an [[education]], the [[citizens]] will not need many laws [[law]], for [[example]] laws [[law]] about the [[city]] or about the markets; but then he confines his [[education]] to the guardians. again, he makes the husbandmen owners of the [[property]] upon condition of their paying a tribute. but in that case they are likely to be much more unmanageable and conceited than the helots, or penestae, or slaves [[slave]] in general. and whether [[community]] of wives [[wife]] and [[property]] be necessary for the lower equally with the higher class or not, and the questions [[question]] akin to this, what will be the [[education]], form of [[government]], laws [[law]] of the lower class, [[socrates]] has nowhere determined: neither is it easy to discover this, nor is their [[character]] of small importance if the [[common]] [[life]] of the guardians is to be maintained. 

again, if [[socrates]] makes the [[women]] [[common]], and retains private [[property]], the [[men]] will see to the fields, but who will see to the house? and who will do so if the agricultural class have both their [[property]] and their wives [[wife]] in [[common]]? once more: it is absurd to argue, from the analogy of the animals, that [[men]] and [[women]] should [[follow]] the same pursuits, for animals have not to manage a household. the [[government]], too, as constituted by [[socrates]], contains elements of danger; for he makes the same persons [[person]] always [[rule]]. and if this is often a cause of disturbance among the meaner sort, how much more among high-spirited warriors? but that the persons [[person]] whom he makes rulers must be the same is evident; for the gold which the [[god]] mingles in the souls [[soul]] of [[men]] is not at one [[time]] given to one, at another [[time]] to another, but always to the same: as he says, 'god mingles gold in some, and silver in others, from their very birth; but brass and iron in those who are meant to be artisans and husbandmen.' again, he deprives the guardians even of [[happiness]], and says that the legislator ought to make the whole [[state]] [[happy]]. but the whole cannot be [[happy]] unless most, or all, or some of its parts enjoy [[happiness]]. in this [[respect]] [[happiness]] is not like the even [[principle]] in numbers, which may [[exist]] only in the whole, but in neither of the parts; not so [[happiness]]. and if the guardians are not [[happy]], who are? surely not the artisans, or the [[common]] [[people]]. the [[republic]] of which [[socrates]] discourses has all these difficulties, and others quite as [[great]]. 

part vi 

the same, or nearly the same, objections apply to plato's later [[work]], the laws [[law]], and therefore we had [[better]] examine briefly the [[constitution]] which is therein described. in the [[republic]], [[socrates]] has definitely settled in all a few questions [[question]] only; such as the [[community]] of [[women]] and [[children]], the [[community]] of [[property]], and the [[constitution]] of the [[state]]. the [[population]] is divided into two classes- one of husbandmen, and the other of warriors; from this latter is taken a third class of counselors and rulers of the [[state]]. but [[socrates]] has not determined whether the husbandmen and artisans are to have a share in the [[government]], and whether they, too, are to carry arms and share in [[military]] service, or not. he certainly thinks [[think]] that the [[women]] ought to share in the [[education]] of the guardians, and to [[fight]] by their side. the remainder of the [[work]] is filled up with digressions [[foreign]] to the main [[subject]], and with discussions about the [[education]] of the guardians. in the laws [[law]] there is hardly anything but laws [[law]]; not much is said about the [[constitution]]. this, which he had intended to make more of the ordinary type, he gradually brings round to the other or ideal form. for with the exception of the [[community]] of [[women]] and [[property]], he supposes everything to be the same in both states; there is to be the same [[education]]; the [[citizens]] of both are to [[live]] [[free]] from servile occupations, and there are to be [[common]] meals in both. the only difference is that in the laws [[law]], the [[common]] meals are extended to [[women]], and the warriors number 5000, but in the [[republic]] only 1000. 

the discourses of [[socrates]] are never commonplace; they always exhibit grace and originality and [[thought]]; but [[perfection]] in everything can hardly be expected. we must not overlook the [[fact]] that the number of 5000 [[citizens]], just now mentioned, will require a territory as large as [[babylon]], or some other huge site, if so many persons [[person]] are to be supported in idleness, together with their [[women]] and attendants, who will be a multitude many times [[time]] as [[great]]. in framing an ideal we may assume what we [[wish]], but should avoid impossibilities. 

it is said that the legislator ought to have his eye directed to two points- the [[people]] and the [[country]]. but neighboring countries [[country]] also must not be forgotten by him, firstly because the [[state]] for which he legislates is to have a [[political]] and not an isolated [[life]]. for a [[state]] must have such a [[military]] [[force]] as will be serviceable against her neighbors, and not merely useful at [[home]]. even if the [[life]] of action is not admitted to be the [[best]], either for individuals [[individual]] or states, still a [[city]] should be formidable to enemies [[enemy]], whether invading or retreating. 

there is another point: should not the amount of [[property]] be defined in some way which differs from this by being clearer? for [[socrates]] says that a [[man]] should have so much [[property]] as will enable him to [[live]] temperately, which is only a way of saying 'to [[live]] well'; this is too general a conception. further, a [[man]] may [[live]] temperately and yet miserably. a [[better]] definition would be that a [[man]] must have so much [[property]] as will enable him to [[live]] not only temperately but liberally; if the two are parted, liberally will combine with luxury; temperance will be associated with toil. for liberality and temperance are the only eligible qualities which have to do with the use of [[property]]. a [[man]] cannot use [[property]] with mildness or [[courage]], but temperately and liberally he may; and therefore the practice of these virtues [[virtue]] is inseparable from [[property]]. there is an inconsistency, too, in too, in equalizing the [[property]] and not regulating the number of the [[citizens]]; the [[population]] is to remain unlimited, and he thinks [[think]] that it will be sufficiently equalized by a [[certain]] number of marriages [[marriage]] being unfruitful, however many are born to others, because he finds this to be the case in existing states. but greater [[care]] will be required than now; for among ourselves, whatever may be the number of [[citizens]], the [[property]] is always distributed among them, and therefore no one is in want; but, if the [[property]] were incapable of division as in the laws [[law]], the supernumeraries, whether few or many, would get nothing. one would have [[thought]] that it was even more necessary to limit [[population]] than [[property]]; and that the limit should be fixed by calculating the chances [[chance]] of [[mortality]] in the [[children]], and of sterility in [[married]] persons [[person]]. the neglect of this [[subject]], which in existing states is so [[common]], is a never-failing cause of [[poverty]] among the [[citizens]]; and [[poverty]] is the parent of [[revolution]] and crime. pheidon the corinthian, who was one of the most ardent legislators, [[thought]] that the families [[family]] and the number of [[citizens]] ought to remain the same, although originally all the lots may have been of different sizes: but in the laws [[law]] the opposite [[principle]] is maintained. what in our [[opinion]] is the [[right]] arrangement will have to be explained hereafter. 

there is another omission in the laws [[law]]: [[socrates]] does not tell us how the rulers differ from their subjects [[subject]]; he only says that they should be related as the warp and the woof, which are made out of different wools. he allows that a man's [[man]] whole [[property]] may be increased fivefold, but why should not his [[land]] also increase to a [[certain]] extent? again, will the [[good]] management of a household be promoted by his arrangement of homesteads? for he assigns to each [[individual]] two homesteads in separate places, and it is difficult to [[live]] in two houses. 

the whole [[system]] of [[government]] tends to be neither [[democracy]] nor [[oligarchy]], but something in a mean between them, which is usually called a polity, and is composed of the heavy-armed soldiers. now, if he intended to frame a [[constitution]] which would suit the [[greatest]] number of states, he was very likely [[right]], but not if he meant to say that this constitutional form came nearest to his first or ideal [[state]]; for many would prefer the lacedaemonian, or, possibly, some other more aristocratic [[government]]. some, indeed, say that the [[best]] [[constitution]] is a combination of all existing forms, and they [[praise]] the lacedaemonian because it is made up of [[oligarchy]], [[monarchy]], and [[democracy]], the [[king]] forming the [[monarchy]], and the council of elders the [[oligarchy]] while the democratic element is represented by the ephors; for the ephors are selected from the [[people]]. others, however, declare the ephoralty to be a [[tyranny]], and find the element of [[democracy]] in the [[common]] meals and in the habits of daily [[life]]. in the laws [[law]] it is maintained that the [[best]] [[constitution]] is made up of [[democracy]] and [[tyranny]], which are either not constitutions [[constitution]] at all, or are the worst of all. but they are nearer the [[truth]] who combine many forms; for the [[constitution]] is [[better]] which is made up of more numerous elements. the [[constitution]] proposed in the laws [[law]] has no element of [[monarchy]] at all; it is nothing but [[oligarchy]] and [[democracy]], leaning rather to [[oligarchy]]. this is seen in the mode of appointing magistrates; for although the appointment of them by lot from among those who have been already selected combines both elements, the way in which the [[rich]] are compelled by [[law]] to attend the assembly and vote for magistrates or discharge other [[political]] duties [[duty]], while the rest may do as they like, and the endeavor to have the greater number of the magistrates appointed out of the richer classes and the highest officers selected from those who have the [[greatest]] incomes, both these are oligarchical features. the oligarchical [[principle]] prevails also in the [[choice]] of the council, for all are compelled to choose, but the compulsion extends only to the [[choice]] out of the first class, and of an [[equal]] number out of the second class and out of the third class, but not in this latter case to all the voters but to those of the first three classes; and the selection of candidates out of the fourth class is only compulsory on the first and second. then, from the persons [[person]] so chosen, he says that there ought to be an [[equal]] number of each class selected. thus a preponderance will be given to the [[better]] sort of [[people]], who have the larger incomes, because many of the lower classes, not being compelled will not vote. these considerations, and others which will be adduced when the [[time]] comes for examining similar polities, tend to show that states like plato's should not be composed of [[democracy]] and [[monarchy]]. there is also a danger in electing the magistrates out of a [[body]] who are themselves elected; for, if but a small number choose to combine, the elections will always go as they [[desire]]. such is the [[constitution]] which is described in the laws [[law]]. 

part vii 

other constitutions [[constitution]] have been proposed; some by private persons [[person]], others by [[philosophers]] and statesmen, which all come nearer to established or existing ones than either of plato's. no one else has introduced such novelties as the [[community]] of [[women]] and [[children]], or [[public]] tables for [[women]]: other legislators begin with what is necessary. in the [[opinion]] of some, the regulation of [[property]] is the [[chief]] point of all, that being the [[question]] upon which all revolutions [[revolution]] turn. this danger was recognized by phaleas of chalcedon, who was the first to affirm that the [[citizens]] of a [[state]] ought to have [[equal]] possessions. he [[thought]] that in a new colony the equalization might be accomplished without difficulty, not so easily when a [[state]] was already established; and that then the shortest way of compassing the [[desired]] end would be for the [[rich]] to give and not to receive [[marriage]] portions, and for the [[poor]] not to give but to receive them. 

plato in the laws [[law]] was of [[opinion]] that, to a [[certain]] extent, accumulation should be allowed, forbidding, as i have already observed, any citizen to possess more than five times [[time]] the minimum qualification but those who make such laws [[law]] should [[remember]] what they are apt to forget- that the legislator who fixes the amount of [[property]] should also fix the number of [[children]]; for, if the [[children]] are too many for the [[property]], the [[law]] must be broken. and, besides the violation of the [[law]], it is a [[bad]] thing that many from being [[rich]] should become [[poor]]; for [[men]] of ruined fortunes [[fortune]] are sure to stir up revolutions [[revolution]]. that the equalization of [[property]] exercises an influence on [[political]] [[society]] was clearly understood even by some of the old legislators. laws [[law]] were made by solon and others prohibiting an [[individual]] from possessing as much [[land]] as he pleased; and there are other laws [[law]] in states which forbid the sale of [[property]]: among the locrians, for [[example]], there is a [[law]] that a [[man]] is not to sell his [[property]] unless he can prove unmistakably that some misfortune has befallen him. again, there have been laws [[law]] which enjoin the preservation of the original lots. such a [[law]] existed in the island of leucas, and the abrogation of it made the [[constitution]] too democratic, for the rulers no longer had the prescribed qualification. again, where there is equality of [[property]], the amount may be either too large or too small, and the possessor may be living either in luxury or penury. clearly, then, the legislator ought not only to aim at the equalization of properties [[property]], but at moderation in their amount. further, if he prescribe this moderate amount equally to all, he will be no nearer the mark; for it is not the possessions but the desires [[desire]] of [[mankind]] which require to be equalized, and this is impossible, unless a sufficient [[education]] is provided by the laws [[law]]. but phaleas will probably reply that this is precisely what he means; and that, in his [[opinion]], there ought to be in states, not only [[equal]] [[property]], but [[equal]] [[education]]. still he should tell precisely what he means; and that, in his [[opinion]], there ought to be in be in having one and the same for all, if it is of a sort that predisposes [[men]] to avarice, or [[ambition]], or both. moreover, civil troubles arise, not only out of the inequality of [[property]], but out of the inequality of [[honor]], though in opposite ways. for the [[common]] [[people]] quarrel about the inequality of [[property]], the higher class about the equality of [[honor]]; as the poet says, 

"the [[bad]] and [[good]] alike in [[honor]] share. "



there are crimes of which the motive is want; and for these phaleas expects to find a cure in the equalization of [[property]], which will take away from a [[man]] the temptation to be a highwayman, because he is hungry or cold. but want is not the sole incentive to crime; [[men]] also [[wish]] to enjoy themselves and not to be in a [[state]] of desire- they [[wish]] to cure some [[desire]], going beyond the necessities of [[life]], which preys upon them; nay, this is not the only reason- they may [[desire]] superfluities in order to enjoy pleasures [[pleasure]] unaccompanied with [[pain]], and therefore they commit crimes. 

now what is the cure of these three disorders? of the first, moderate possessions and occupation; of the second, habits of temperance; as to the third, if any [[desire]] pleasures [[pleasure]] which depend on themselves, they will find the satisfaction of their desires [[desire]] nowhere but in [[philosophy]]; for all other pleasures [[pleasure]] we are dependent on others. the [[fact]] is that the [[greatest]] crimes are caused by excess and not by necessity. [[men]] do not become tyrants [[tyrant]] in order that they may not suffer cold; and hence [[great]] is the [[honor]] bestowed, not on him who kills a thief, but on him who kills a [[tyrant]]. thus we see that the [[institutions]] of phaleas avail only against petty crimes. 

there is another objection to them. they are chiefly designed to promote the internal welfare of the [[state]]. but the legislator should consider also its relation to neighboring nations, and to all who are outside of it. the [[government]] must be organized with a view to [[military]] [[strength]]; and of this he has said not a word. and so with [[respect]] to [[property]]: there should not only be enough to supply the internal wants of the [[state]], but also to meet dangers coming from without. the [[property]] of the [[state]] should not be so large that more powerful neighbors may be tempted by it, while the owners are unable to repel the invaders; nor yet so small that the [[state]] is unable to maintain a [[war]] even against states of [[equal]] [[power]], and of the same [[character]]. phaleas has not laid down any [[rule]]; but we should bear in [[mind]] that abundance of [[wealth]] is an advantage. the [[best]] limit will probably be, that a more powerful neighbor must have no inducement to go to [[war]] with you by [[reason]] of the excess of your [[wealth]], but only such as he would have had if you had possessed less. there is a story that eubulus, when autophradates was going to besiege atarneus, told him to consider how long the operation would take, and then reckon up the cost which would be incurred in the [[time]]. 'for,' said he, 'i am willing for a smaller sum than that to leave atarneus at once.' these words of eubulus made an impression on autophradates, and he desisted from the siege. 

the equalization of [[property]] is one of the things that tend to prevent the [[citizens]] from quarrelling. not that the gain in this direction is very [[great]]. for the nobles [[noble]] will be dissatisfied because they [[think]] themselves worthy of more than an [[equal]] share of honors; and this is often found to be a cause of sedition and [[revolution]]. and the avarice of [[mankind]] is insatiable; at one [[time]] two obols was [[pay]] enough; but now, when this sum has become customary, [[men]] always want more and more without end; for it is of the [[nature]] of [[desire]] not to be satisfied, and most [[men]] [[live]] only for the gratification of it. the beginning of reform is not so much to equalize [[property]] as to train the nobler sort of natures [[nature]] not to [[desire]] more, and to prevent the lower from getting more; that is to say, they must be kept down, but not ill-treated. besides, the equalization proposed by phaleas is imperfect; for he only equalizes [[land]], whereas a [[man]] may be [[rich]] also in slaves [[slave]], and cattle, and [[money]], and in the abundance of what are called his movables. now either all these things must be equalized, or some limit must be imposed on them, or they must an be let alone. it would appear that phaleas is legislating for a small [[city]] only, if, as he supposes, all the artisans are to be [[public]] slaves [[slave]] and not to form a supplementary part of the [[body]] of [[citizens]]. but if there is a [[law]] that artisans are to be [[public]] slaves [[slave]], it should only apply to those engaged on [[public]] works [[work]], as at epidamnus, or at [[athens]] on the plan which diophantus once introduced. 

from these observations any one may [[judge]] how far phaleas was [[wrong]] or [[right]] in his ideas [[idea]]. 

part viii 

hippodamus, the [[son]] of euryphon, a native of miletus, the same who [[invented]] the art [[arts]] of planning cities [[city]], and who also laid out the piraeus- a [[strange]] [[man]], whose fondness for distinction [[led]] him into a general eccentricity of [[life]], which made some [[think]] him affected (for he would wear flowing hair and expensive ornaments; but these were worn on a cheap but warm garment both in winter and summer); he, besides aspiring to be an adept in the [[knowledge]] of [[nature]], was the first [[person]] not a statesman who made inquiries about the [[best]] form of [[government]]. 

the [[city]] of hippodamus was composed of 10,000 [[citizens]] divided into three parts- one of artisans, one of husbandmen, and a third of armed defenders of the [[state]]. he also divided the [[land]] into three parts, one [[sacred]], one [[public]], the third private: the first was set apart to maintain the customary [[worship]] of the gods, the second was to support the warriors, the third was the [[property]] of the husbandmen. he also divided laws [[law]] into three classes, and no more, for he maintained that there are three subjects [[subject]] of lawsuits- insult, injury, and homicide. he likewise instituted a [[single]] final court of appeal, to which all causes seeming to have been improperly decided might be referred; this court he formed of elders chosen for the [[purpose]]. he was further of [[opinion]] that the decisions of the courts ought not to be given by the use of a voting pebble, but that every one should have a tablet on which he might not only write a simple condemnation, or leave the tablet blank for a simple acquittal; but, if he partly acquitted and partly condemned, he was to distinguish accordingly. to the existing [[law]] he objected that it obliged the judges [[judge]] to be guilty of perjury, whichever way they voted. he also enacted that those who discovered anything for the [[good]] of the [[state]] should be honored; and he provided that the [[children]] of [[citizens]] who died in [[battle]] should be maintained at the [[public]] expense, as if such an enactment had never been heard of before, yet it actually exists at [[athens]] and in other places. as to the magistrates, he would have them all elected by the [[people]], that is, by the three classes already mentioned, and those who were elected were to watch over the interests of the [[public]], of strangers, and of orphans. these are the most striking points in the [[constitution]] of hippodamus. there is not much else. 

the first of these proposals to which objection may be taken is the threefold division of the [[citizens]]. the artisans, and the husbandmen, and the warriors, all have a share in the [[government]]. but the husbandmen have no arms, and the artisans neither arms nor [[land]], and therefore they become all but slaves [[slave]] of the warrior class. that they should share in all the offices is an impossibility; for generals and guardians of the [[citizens]], and nearly all the principal magistrates, must be taken from the class of those who carry arms. yet, if the two other classes have no share in the [[government]], how can they be [[loyal]] [[citizens]]? it may be said that those who have arms must necessarily be masters of both the other classes, but this is not so easily accomplished unless they are numerous; and if they are, why should the other classes share in the [[government]] at all, or have [[power]] to appoint magistrates? further, what use are farmers [[farmer]] to the [[city]]? artisans there must be, for these are wanted in every [[city]], and they can [[live]] by their craft, as elsewhere; and the husbandmen too, if they really provided the warriors with food, might fairly have a share in the [[government]]. but in the [[republic]] of hippodamus they are supposed to have [[land]] of their own, which they cultivate for their private benefit. again, as to this [[common]] [[land]] out of which the soldiers are maintained, if they are themselves to be the cultivators of it, the warrior class will be identical with the husbandmen, although the legislator intended to make a distinction between them. if, again, there are to be other cultivators distinct both from the husbandmen, who have [[land]] of their own, and from the warriors, they will make a fourth class, which has no place in the [[state]] and no share in anything. or, if the same persons [[person]] are to cultivate their own lands [[land]], and those of the [[public]] as well, they will have difficulty in supplying the quantity of [[produce]] which will maintain two households: and why, in this case, should there be any division, for they might find food themselves and give to the warriors from the same [[land]] and the same lots? there is surely a [[great]] confusion in all this. 

neither is the [[law]] to commended which says that the judges [[judge]], when a simple issue is laid before them, should distinguish in their judgement; for the [[judge]] is thus converted into an arbitrator. now, in an arbitration, although the arbitrators are many, they confer with one another about the decision, and therefore they can distinguish; but in courts of [[law]] this is impossible, and, indeed, most legislators take pains [[pain]] to prevent the judges [[judge]] from holding any communication with one another. again, will there not be confusion if the [[judge]] thinks [[think]] that damages should be given, but not so much as the suitor demands? he asks, say, for twenty minae, and the [[judge]] allows him ten minae (or in general the suitor asks for more and the [[judge]] allows less), while another [[judge]] allows five, another four minae. in this way they will go on splitting up the damages, and some will grant the whole and others nothing: how is the final reckoning to be taken? again, no one contends that he who votes for a simple acquittal or condemnation perjures himself, if the indictment has been laid in an unqualified form; and this is just, for the [[judge]] who acquits does not decide that the defendant owes nothing, but that he does not owe the twenty minae. he only is guilty of perjury who thinks [[think]] that the defendant ought not to [[pay]] twenty minae, and yet condemns him. 

to [[honor]] those who discover anything which is useful to the [[state]] is a proposal which has a specious sound, but cannot safely be enacted by [[law]], for it may encourage informers, and perhaps even lead to [[political]] commotions. this [[question]] involves another. it has been doubted whether it is or is not expedient to make any changes [[change]] in the laws [[law]] of a [[country]], even if another [[law]] be [[better]]. now, if an changes [[change]] are inexpedient, we can hardly assent to the proposal of hippodamus; for, under pretense of doing a [[public]] service, a [[man]] may introduce measures which are really destructive to the laws [[law]] or to the [[constitution]]. but, since we have touched upon this [[subject]], perhaps we had [[better]] go a little into detail, for, as i was saying, there is a difference of [[opinion]], and it may sometimes seem desirable to make changes [[change]]. such changes [[change]] in the other [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] have certainly been beneficial; medicine, for [[example]], and gymnastic, and every other art [[arts]] and craft have departed from traditional usage. and, if [[politics]] be an art [[arts]], [[change]] must be necessary in this as in any other art [[arts]]. that improvement has occurred is shown by the [[fact]] that old customs are exceedingly simple and barbarous. for the ancient hellenes went about armed and bought their brides of each other. the remains of ancient laws [[law]] which have come down to us are quite absurd; for [[example]], at cumae there is a [[law]] about murder, to the effect that if the accuser [[produce]] a [[certain]] number of witnesses from among his own kinsmen, the accused shall be held guilty. again, [[men]] in general [[desire]] the [[good]], and not merely what their fathers [[father]] had. but the primeval inhabitants, whether they were born of the [[earth]] or were the survivors of some destruction, may be supposed to have been no [[better]] than ordinary or even foolish [[people]] among ourselves (such is certainly the tradition concerning the earth-born men); and it would be ridiculous to rest contented with their notions. even when laws [[law]] have been written down, they ought not always to remain unaltered. as in other sciences [[science]], so in [[politics]], it is impossible that all things should be precisely set down in writing; for enactments must be universal, but actions are concerned with particulars. hence we infer that sometimes and in [[certain]] cases laws [[law]] may be changed; but when we look at the matter from another point of view, [[great]] caution would seem to be required. for the habit of lightly changing the laws [[law]] is an [[evil]], and, when the advantage is small, some errors both of lawgivers and rulers had [[better]] be left; the citizen will not gain so much by making the [[change]] as he will lose by the habit of disobedience. the analogy of the [[arts]] is false; a [[change]] in a [[law]] is a very different thing from a [[change]] in an art [[arts]]. for the [[law]] has no [[power]] to command [[obedience]] except that of habit, which can only be given by [[time]], so that a readiness to [[change]] from old to new laws [[law]] enfeebles the [[power]] of the [[law]]. even if we admit that the laws [[law]] are to be changed, are they all to be changed, and in every [[state]]? and are they to be changed by anybody who likes, or only by [[certain]] persons [[person]]? these are very important questions [[question]]; and therefore we had [[better]] reserve the discussion of them to a more suitable [[occasion]]. 

part ix 

in the governments [[government]] of lacedaemon and crete, and indeed in all governments [[government]], two points have to be considered: first, whether any particular [[law]] is [[good]] or [[bad]], when compared with the [[perfect]] [[state]]; secondly, whether it is or is not consistent with the [[idea]] and [[character]] which the lawgiver has set before his [[citizens]]. that in a well-ordered [[state]] the [[citizens]] should have leisure and not have to provide for their daily wants is generally acknowledged, but there is a difficulty in seeing how this leisure is to be attained. the thessalian penestae have often risen against their masters, and the helots in like manner against the lacedaemonians, for whose misfortunes they are always lying in wait. nothing, however, of this [[kind]] has as yet happened to the cretans; the [[reason]] probably is that the neighboring cities [[city]], even when at [[war]] with one another, never form an [[alliance]] with rebellious serfs, rebellions not being for their interest, since they themselves have a dependent [[population]]. whereas all the neighbors of the lacedaemonians, whether argives, messenians, or arcadians, were their enemies [[enemy]]. in thessaly, again, the original revolt of the slaves [[slave]] occurred because the thessalians were still at [[war]] with the neighboring achaeans, perrhaebians, and magnesians. besides, if there were no other difficulty, the treatment or management of slaves [[slave]] is a troublesome affair; for, if not kept in hand, they are insolent, and [[think]] that they are as [[good]] as their masters, and, if harshly treated, they hate and conspire against them. now it is clear that when these are the results the [[citizens]] of a [[state]] have not found out the secret of managing their [[subject]] [[population]]. 

again, the license of the lacedaemonian [[women]] defeats the intention of the spartan [[constitution]], and is adverse to the [[happiness]] of the [[state]]. for, a husband and [[wife]] being each a part of every [[family]], the [[state]] may be considered as about equally divided into [[men]] and [[women]]; and, therefore, in those states in which the condition of the [[women]] is [[bad]], half the [[city]] may be regarded as having no laws [[law]]. and this is what has actually happened at sparta; the legislator wanted to make the whole [[state]] hardy and temperate, and he has carried out his intention in the case of the [[men]], but he has neglected the [[women]], who [[live]] in every sort of intemperance and luxury. the consequence is that in such a [[state]] [[wealth]] is too highly valued, especially if the citizen fall under the dominion of their wives [[wife]], after the manner of most warlike races [[race]], except the celts and a few others who openly approve of male loves [[love]]. the old mythologer would seem to have been [[right]] in uniting ares and aphrodite, for all warlike races [[race]] are prone to the [[love]] either of [[men]] or of [[women]]. this was exemplified among the spartans in the days of their greatness; many things were managed by their [[women]]. but what difference does it make whether [[women]] [[rule]], or the rulers are ruled by [[women]]? the result is the same. even in regard to [[courage]], which is of no use in daily [[life]], and is needed only in [[war]], the influence of the lacedaemonian [[women]] has been most mischievous. the [[evil]] showed itself in the theban [[invasion]], when, unlike the [[women]] other cities [[city]], they were utterly useless and caused more confusion than the [[enemy]]. this license of the lacedaemonian [[women]] existed from the earliest times [[time]], and was only what might be expected. for, during the wars [[war]] of the lacedaemonians, first against the argives, and afterwards against the arcadians and messenians, the [[men]] were long away from [[home]], and, on the return of [[peace]], they gave themselves into the legislator's hand, already prepared by the discipline of a soldier's [[life]] (in which there are many elements of virtue), to receive his enactments. but, when lycurgus, as tradition says, wanted to bring the [[women]] under his laws [[law]], they resisted, and he gave up the attempt. these then are the causes of what then happened, and this defect in the [[constitution]] is clearly to be attributed to them. we are not, however, considering what is or is not to be excused, but what is [[right]] or [[wrong]], and the disorder of the [[women]], as i have already said, not only gives an air of indecorum to the [[constitution]] considered in itself, but tends in a measure to foster avarice. 

the mention of avarice naturally suggests a criticism on the inequality of [[property]]. while some of the spartan citizen have quite small properties [[property]], others have very large ones; hence the [[land]] has passed into the hands of a few. and this is due also to faulty laws [[law]]; for, although the legislator rightly holds up to shame the sale or purchase of an [[inheritance]], he allows anybody who likes to give or bequeath it. yet both practices lead to the same result. and nearly two-fifths of the whole [[country]] are held by [[women]]; this is owing to the number of heiresses and to the large dowries which are customary. it would surely have been [[better]] to have given no dowries at all, or, if any, but small or moderate ones. as the [[law]] now stands, a [[man]] may bestow his heiress on any one whom he pleases, and, if he [[die]] intestate, the [[privilege]] of giving her away descends to his heir. hence, although the [[country]] is able to maintain 1500 cavalry and 30,000 hoplites, the whole number of spartan [[citizens]] fell below 1000. the result proves the faulty [[nature]] of their laws [[law]] respecting [[property]]; for the [[city]] sank under a [[single]] defeat; the want of [[men]] was their ruin. there is a tradition that, in the days of their ancient kings [[king]], they were in the habit of giving the rights [[right]] of citizenship to strangers, and therefore, in spite of their long wars [[war]], no lack of [[population]] was experienced by them; indeed, at one [[time]] sparta is said to have numbered not less than 10,000 [[citizens]] whether this statement is true or not, it would certainly have been [[better]] to have maintained their numbers by the equalization of [[property]]. again, the [[law]] which relates to the procreation of [[children]] is adverse to the correction of this inequality. for the legislator, wanting to have as many spartans as he could, encouraged the [[citizens]] to have large families [[family]]; and there is a [[law]] at sparta that the [[father]] of three sons [[son]] shall be exempt from [[military]] service, and he who has four from all the burdens of the [[state]]. yet it is obvious that, if there were many [[children]], the [[land]] being distributed as it is, many of them must necessarily fall into [[poverty]]. 

the lacedaemonian [[constitution]] is defective in another point; i mean the ephoralty. this magistracy has [[authority]] in the highest matters, but the ephors are chosen from the whole [[people]], and so the office is apt to fall into the hands of very [[poor]] [[men]], who, being badly off, are open to bribes. there have been many examples [[example]] at sparta of this [[evil]] in former times [[time]]; and quite recently, in the matter of the andrians, [[certain]] of the ephors who were bribed did their [[best]] to ruin the [[state]]. and so [[great]] and [[tyrannical]] is their [[power]], that even the kings [[king]] have been compelled to court them, so that, in this way as well together with the [[royal]] office, the whole [[constitution]] has deteriorated, and from being an [[aristocracy]] has turned into a [[democracy]]. the ephoralty certainly does keep the [[state]] together; for the [[people]] are contented when they have a share in the highest office, and the result, whether due to the legislator or to [[chance]], has been advantageous. for if a [[constitution]] is to be permanent, all the parts of the [[state]] must [[wish]] that it should [[exist]] and the same arrangements be maintained. this is the case at sparta, where the kings [[king]] [[desire]] its permanence because they have due [[honor]] in their own persons [[person]]; the nobles [[noble]] because they are represented in the council of elders (for the office of elder is a [[reward]] of virtue); and the [[people]], because all are eligible to the ephoralty. the election of ephors out of the whole [[people]] is perfectly [[right]], but ought not to be carried on in the [[present]] [[fashion]], which is too childish. again, they have the decision of [[great]] causes, although they are quite ordinary [[men]], and therefore they should not determine them merely on their own [[judgment]], but according to written rules [[rule]], and to the laws [[law]]. their way of [[life]], too, is not in accordance with the spirit of the constitution- they have a deal too much license; whereas, in the case of the other [[citizens]], the excess of strictness is so intolerable that they run away from the [[law]] into the secret indulgence of sensual pleasures [[pleasure]]. 

again, the council of elders is not [[free]] from defects. it may be said that the elders are [[good]] [[men]] and well trained in manly [[virtue]]; and that, therefore, there is an advantage to the [[state]] in having them. but that judges [[judge]] of important causes should hold office for [[life]] is a disputable thing, for the [[mind]] grows old as well as the [[body]]. and when [[men]] have been educated in such a manner that even the legislator himself cannot trust them, there is real danger. many of the elders are well known to have taken bribes and to have been guilty of partiality in [[public]] affairs. and therefore they ought not to be irresponsible; yet at sparta they are so. but (it may be replied), 'all magistracies are accountable to the ephors.' yes, but this prerogative is too [[great]] for them, and we maintain that the control should be exercised in some other manner. further, the mode in which the spartans elect their elders is childish; and it is improper that the [[person]] to be elected should canvass for the office; the worthiest should be appointed, whether he chooses or not. and here the legislator clearly indicates the same intention which appears in other parts of his [[constitution]]; he would have his [[citizens]] ambitious, and he has reckoned upon this quality in the election of the elders; for no one would ask to be elected if he were not. yet [[ambition]] and avarice, almost more than any other [[passions]], are the motives of crime. 

whether kings [[king]] are or are not an advantage to states, i will consider at another [[time]]; they should at any rate be chosen, not as they are now, but with regard to their personal [[life]] and conduct. the legislator himself obviously did not suppose that he could make them really [[good]] [[men]]; at least he shows a [[great]] distrust of their [[virtue]]. for this [[reason]] the spartans used to join enemies [[enemy]] with them in the same embassy, and the quarrels between the kings [[king]] were held to be conservative of the [[state]]. 

neither did the first introducer of the [[common]] meals, called 'phiditia,' regulate them well. the entertainment ought to have been provided at the [[public]] cost, as in crete; but among the lacedaemonians every one is expected to contribute, and some of them are too [[poor]] to afford the expense; thus the intention of the legislator is frustrated. the [[common]] meals were meant to be a popular institution, but the existing manner of regulating them is the reverse of popular. for the very [[poor]] can scarcely take part in them; and, according to ancient custom, those who cannot contribute are not allowed to retain their rights [[right]] of citizenship. 

the [[law]] about the spartan admirals has often been censured, and with [[justice]]; it is a source of dissension, for the kings [[king]] are perpetual generals, and this office of admiral is but the setting up of another [[king]]. 

the charge which [[plato]] brings, in the laws [[law]], against the intention of the legislator, is likewise justified; the whole [[constitution]] has regard to one part of [[virtue]] only- the [[virtue]] of the soldier, which gives [[victory]] in [[war]]. so long as they were at [[war]], therefore, their [[power]] was preserved, but when they had attained [[empire]] they fell for of the [[arts]] of [[peace]] they knew nothing, and had never engaged in any employment higher than [[war]]. there is another error, equally [[great]], into which they have fallen. although they truly [[think]] that the goods [[good]] for which [[men]] contend are to be acquired by [[virtue]] rather than by [[vice]], they err in supposing that these goods [[good]] are to be preferred to the [[virtue]] which gains them. 

once more: the revenues [[revenue]] of the [[state]] are ill-managed; there is no [[money]] in the treasury, although they are obliged to carry on [[great]] wars [[war]], and they are unwilling to [[pay]] taxes. the greater part of the [[land]] being in the hands of the spartans, they do not look closely into one another's contributions. the result which the legislator has produced is the reverse of beneficial; for he has made his [[city]] [[poor]], and his [[citizens]] greedy. 

enough respecting the spartan [[constitution]], of which these are the principal defects. 

part x 

the cretan [[constitution]] nearly resembles the spartan, and in some few points is quite as [[good]]; but for the most part less [[perfect]] in form. the older constitutions [[constitution]] are generally less elaborate than the later, and the lacedaemonian is said to be, and probably is, in a very [[great]] measure, a copy of the cretan. according to tradition, lycurgus, when he ceased to be the guardian of [[king]] charillus, went abroad and spent most of his [[time]] in crete. for the two countries [[country]] are nearly connected; the lyctians are a colony of the lacedaemonians, and the colonists, when they came to crete, adopted the [[constitution]] which they found existing among the inhabitants. even to this day the perioeci, or [[subject]] [[population]] of crete, are governed by the original laws [[law]] which minos is supposed to have enacted. the island seems to be intended by [[nature]] for dominion in hellas, and to be well situated; it extends [[right]] across the sea, around which nearly all the hellenes are settled; and while one end is not far from the peloponnese, the other almost reaches to the region of [[asia]] about triopium and rhodes. hence minos acquired the [[empire]] of the sea, subduing some of the islands and colonizing others; at [[last]] he invaded sicily, where he died near camicus. 

the cretan [[institutions]] resemble the lacedaemonian. the helots are the husbandmen of the one, the perioeci of the other, and both cretans and lacedaemonians have [[common]] meals, which were anciently called by the lacedaemonians not 'phiditia' but 'andria'; and the cretans have the same word, the use of which proves that the [[common]] meals originally came from crete. further, the two constitutions [[constitution]] are similar; for the office of the ephors is the same as that of the cretan cosmi, the only difference being that whereas the ephors are five, the cosmi are ten in number. the elders, too, [[answer]] to the elders in crete, who are termed by the cretans the council. and the kingly office once existed in crete, but was abolished, and the cosmi have now the [[duty]] of leading them in [[war]]. all classes share in the ecclesia, but it can only ratify the decrees of the elders and the cosmi. 

the [[common]] meals of crete are certainly [[better]] managed than the lacedaemonian; for in lacedaemon every one pays [[pay]] so much per head, or, if he fails, the [[law]], as i have already explained, forbids him to exercise the rights [[right]] of citizenship. but in crete they are of a more popular [[character]]. there, of all the fruits of the [[earth]] and cattle raised on the [[public]] lands [[land]], and of the tribute which is paid by the perioeci, one portion is assigned to the gods and to the service of the [[state]], and another to the [[common]] meals, so that [[men]], [[women]], and [[children]] are all supported out of a [[common]] stock. the legislator has many ingenious ways of securing moderation in eating, which he conceives to be a gain; he likewise encourages the separation of [[men]] from [[women]], lest they should have too many [[children]], and the companionship of [[men]] with one another- whether this is a [[good]] or [[bad]] thing i shall have an opportunity of considering at another [[time]]. but that the cretan [[common]] meals are [[better]] ordered than the lacedaemonian there can be no [[doubt]]. 

on the other hand, the cosmi are even a worse institution than the ephors, of which they have all the evils [[evil]] without the [[good]]. like the ephors, they are any [[chance]] persons [[person]], but in crete this is not counterbalanced by a corresponding [[political]] advantage. at sparta every one is eligible, and the [[body]] of the [[people]], having a share in the highest office, want the [[constitution]] to be permanent. but in crete the cosmi are elected out of [[certain]] families [[family]], and not out of the whole [[people]], and the elders out of those who have been cosmi. 

the same criticism may be made about the cretan, which has been already made about the lacedaemonian elders. their irresponsibility and [[life]] tenure is too [[great]] a [[privilege]], and their arbitrary [[power]] of acting upon their own [[judgment]], and dispensing with written [[law]], is dangerous. it is no proof of the goodness of the institution that the [[people]] are not discontented at being excluded from it. for there is no [[profit]] to be made out of the office as out of the ephoralty, since, unlike the ephors, the cosmi, being in an island, are removed from temptation. 

the remedy by which they [[correct]] the [[evil]] of this institution is an extraordinary one, suited rather to a close [[oligarchy]] than to a constitutional [[state]]. for the cosmi are often expelled by a conspiracy of their own colleagues, or of private individuals [[individual]]; and they are allowed also to resign before their term of office has expired. surely all matters of this [[kind]] are [[better]] regulated by [[law]] than by the will of [[man]], which is a very unsafe [[rule]]. worst of all is the suspension of the office of cosmi, a device to which the nobles [[noble]] often have recourse when they will not submit to [[justice]]. this shows that the cretan [[government]], although possessing some of the characteristics of a constitutional [[state]], is really a close [[oligarchy]]. 

the nobles [[noble]] have a habit, too, of setting up a [[chief]]; they get together a party among the [[common]] [[people]] and their own [[friends]] and then quarrel and [[fight]] with one another. what is this but the temporary destruction of the [[state]] and dissolution of [[society]]? a [[city]] is in a dangerous condition when those who are willing are also able to attack her. but, as i have already said, the island of crete is saved by her situation; distance has the same effect as the lacedaemonian prohibition of strangers; and the cretans have no [[foreign]] dominions. this is the [[reason]] why the perioeci are contented in crete, whereas the helots are perpetually revolting. but when lately [[foreign]] invaders found their way into the island, the weakness of the cretan [[constitution]] was revealed. enough of the [[government]] of crete. 

part xi 

the carthaginians are also considered to have an excellent form of [[government]], which differs from that of any other [[state]] in several respects [[respect]], though it is in some very like the lacedaemonian. indeed, all three states- the lacedaemonian, the cretan, and the carthaginian- nearly resemble one another, and are very different from any others. many of the carthaginian [[institutions]] are excellent the superiority of their [[constitution]] is proved by the [[fact]] that the [[common]] [[people]] remain [[loyal]] to the [[constitution]] the carthaginians have never had any rebellion worth speaking of, and have never been under the [[rule]] of a [[tyrant]]. 

among the points in which the carthaginian [[constitution]] resembles the lacedaemonian are the following: the [[common]] tables of the clubs [[answer]] to the spartan phiditia, and their magistracy of the 104 to the ephors; but, whereas the ephors are any [[chance]] persons [[person]], the magistrates of the carthaginians are elected according to merit- this is an improvement. they have also their kings [[king]] and their gerusia, or council of elders, who correspond to the kings [[king]] and elders of sparta. their kings [[king]], unlike the spartan, are not always of the same [[family]], nor that an ordinary one, but if there is some distinguished [[family]] they are selected out of it and not appointed by senority- this is far [[better]]. such officers have [[great]] [[power]], and therefore, if they are persons [[person]] of little worth, do a [[great]] deal of harm, and they have already done harm at lacedaemon. 

most of the defects or deviations from the [[perfect]] [[state]], for which the carthaginian [[constitution]] would be censured, apply equally to all the forms of [[government]] which we have mentioned. but of the deflections from [[aristocracy]] and constitutional [[government]], some incline more to [[democracy]] and some to [[oligarchy]]. the kings [[king]] and elders, if unanimous, may determine whether they will or will not bring a matter before the [[people]], but when they are not unanimous, the [[people]] decide on such matters as well. and whatever the kings [[king]] and elders bring before the [[people]] is not only heard but also determined by them, and any one who likes may oppose it; now this is not permitted in sparta and crete. that the magistrates of five who have under them many important matters should be co-opted, that they should choose the supreme council of 100, and should hold office longer than other magistrates (for they are virtually rulers both before and after they hold office)- these are oligarchical features; their being without salary and not elected by lot, and any similar points, such as the practice of having all suits tried by the magistrates, and not some by one class of judges [[judge]] or jurors and some by another, as at lacedaemon, are characteristic of [[aristocracy]]. the carthaginian [[constitution]] deviates from [[aristocracy]] and inclines to [[oligarchy]], chiefly on a point where popular [[opinion]] is on their side. for [[men]] in general [[think]] that magistrates should be chosen not only for their [[merit]], but for their [[wealth]]: a [[man]], they say, who is [[poor]] cannot [[rule]] well- he has not the leisure. if, then, election of magistrates for their [[wealth]] be characteristic of [[oligarchy]], and election for [[merit]] of [[aristocracy]], there will be a third form under which the [[constitution]] of [[carthage]] is comprehended; for the carthaginians choose their magistrates, and particularly the highest of them- their kings [[king]] and generals- with an eye both to [[merit]] and to [[wealth]]. 

but we must acknowledge that, in thus deviating from [[aristocracy]], the legislator has committed an error. nothing is more absolutely necessary than to provide that the highest class, not only when in office, but when out of office, should have leisure and not disgrace themselves in any way; and to this his attention should be first directed. even if you must have regard to [[wealth]], in order to secure leisure, yet it is surely a [[bad]] thing that the [[greatest]] offices, such as those of kings [[king]] and generals, should be bought. the [[law]] which allows this [[abuse]] makes [[wealth]] of more account than [[virtue]], and the whole [[state]] becomes avaricious. for, whenever the chiefs [[chief]] of the [[state]] deem anything honorable, the other [[citizens]] are sure to [[follow]] their [[example]]; and, where [[virtue]] has not the first place, their [[aristocracy]] cannot be firmly established. those who have been at the expense of purchasing their places will be in the habit of repaying themselves; and it is absurd to suppose that a [[poor]] and honest [[man]] will be wanting to make gains, and that a lower stamp of [[man]] who has incurred a [[great]] expense will not. wherefore they should [[rule]] who are able to [[rule]] [[best]]. and even if the legislator does not [[care]] to [[protect]] the [[good]] from [[poverty]], he should at any rate secure leisure for them when in office. 

it would seem also to be a [[bad]] [[principle]] that the same [[person]] should hold many offices, which is a favorite practice among the carthaginians, for one [[business]] is [[better]] done by one [[man]]. the legislator should see to this and should not appoint the same [[person]] to be a flute-player and a shoemaker. hence, where the [[state]] is large, it is more in accordance both with constitutional and with democratic principles [[principle]] that the offices of [[state]] should be distributed among many persons [[person]]. for, as i said, this arrangement is fairer to all, and any action familiarized by repetition is [[better]] and sooner performed. we have a proof in [[military]] and naval matters; the duties [[duty]] of command and of [[obedience]] in both these services extend to all. 

the [[government]] of the carthaginians is oligarchical, but they successfully escape the evils [[evil]] of [[oligarchy]] by enriching one portion of the [[people]] after another by sending them to their colonies. this is their panacea and the means by which they give stability to the [[state]]. accident favors them, but the legislator should be able to provide against [[revolution]] without trusting to accidents. as things are, if any misfortune occurred, and the bulk of the subjects [[subject]] revolted, there would be no way of restoring [[peace]] by legal methods. 

such is the [[character]] of the lacedaemonian, cretan, and carthaginian constitutions [[constitution]], which are justly celebrated.

of those who have treated of governments [[government]], some have never taken any part at all in [[public]] affairs, but have passed their lives [[life]] in a private station; about most of them, what was worth telling has been already told. others have been lawgivers, either in their own or in [[foreign]] cities [[city]], whose affairs they have administered; and of these some have only made laws [[law]], others have framed constitutions [[constitution]]; for [[example]], lycurgus and solon did both. of the lacedaemonian [[constitution]] i have already spoken. as to solon, he is [[thought]] by some to have been a [[good]] legislator, who put an end to the exclusiveness of the [[oligarchy]], emancipated the [[people]], established the ancient athenian [[democracy]], and harmonized the different elements of the [[state]]. according to their view, the council of areopagus was an oligarchical element, the elected magistracy, aristocratical, and the courts of [[law]], democratical. the [[truth]] seems to be that the council and the elected magistracy existed before the [[time]] of solon, and were retained by him, but that he formed the courts of [[law]] out of an the [[citizens]], thus creating the [[democracy]], which is the very [[reason]] why he is sometimes blamed. for in giving the supreme [[power]] to the [[law]] courts, which are elected by lot, he is [[thought]] to have destroyed the non-democratic element. when the [[law]] courts grew powerful, to please the [[people]] who were now playing the [[tyrant]] the old [[constitution]] was changed into the existing [[democracy]]. ephialtes and pericles curtailed the [[power]] of the areopagus; pericles also instituted the payment of the juries, and thus every demagogue in turn increased the [[power]] of the [[democracy]] until it became what we now see. all this is true; it seems, however, to be the result of circumstances, and not to have been intended by solon. for the [[people]], having been instrumental in gaining the [[empire]] of the sea in the persian [[war]], began to get a notion of itself, and followed worthless demagogues, whom the [[better]] class opposed. solon, himself, appears to have given the athenians only that [[power]] of electing to offices and calling to account the magistrates which was absolutely necessary; for without it they would have been in a [[state]] of [[slavery]] and enmity to the [[government]]. all the magistrates he appointed from the notables and the [[men]] of [[wealth]], that is to say, from the pentacosio-medimni, or from the class called zeugitae, or from a third class of so-called knights or cavalry. the fourth class were laborers who had no share in any magistracy. 

mere legislators were zaleucus, who gave laws [[law]] to the epizephyrian locrians, and charondas, who legislated for his own [[city]] of catana, and for the other chalcidian cities [[city]] in [[italy]] and sicily. some [[people]] attempt to make out that onomacritus was the first [[person]] who had any special [[skill]] in legislation, and that he, although a locrian by birth, was trained in crete, where he lived in the exercise of his prophetic art [[arts]]; that thales was his companion, and that lycurgus and zaleucus were disciples of thales, as charondas was of zaleucus. but their account is quite inconsistent with chronology. 

there was also philolaus, the corinthian, who gave laws [[law]] to the thebans. this philolaus was one of the [[family]] of the bacchiadae, and a lover of diocles, the olympic victor, who left corinth in [[horror]] of the incestuous passion which his [[mother]] halcyone had conceived for him, and retired to thebes, where the two [[friends]] together ended their days. the inhabitants still point out their tombs, whic

he who would inquire into the essence and attributes of various kinds [[kind]] of governments [[government]] must first of all determine 'what is a [[state]]?' at [[present]] this is a disputed [[question]]. some say that the [[state]] has done a [[certain]] act; others, no, not the [[state]], but the [[oligarchy]] or the [[tyrant]]. and the legislator or statesman is concerned entirely with the [[state]]; a [[constitution]] or [[government]] being an arrangement of the inhabitants of a [[state]]. but a [[state]] is composite, like any other whole made up of many parts; these are the [[citizens]], who compose it. it is evident, therefore, that we must begin by asking, who is the citizen, and what is the meaning of the term? for here again there may be a difference of [[opinion]]. he who is a citizen in a [[democracy]] will often not be a citizen in an [[oligarchy]]. leaving out of consideration those who have been made [[citizens]], or who have obtained the name of citizen any other accidental manner, we may say, first, that a citizen is not a citizen because he lives [[life]] in a [[certain]] place, for resident aliens and slaves [[slave]] share in the place; nor is he a citizen who has no legal [[right]] except that of suing and being sued; for this [[right]] may be enjoyed under the provisions of a treaty. nay, resident aliens in many places do not possess even such rights [[right]] completely, for they are obliged to have a patron, so that they do but imperfectly participate in citizenship, and we call them [[citizens]] only in a qualified sense, as we might apply the term to [[children]] who are too [[young]] to be on the register, or to old [[men]] who have been relieved from [[state]] duties [[duty]]. of these we do not say quite simply that they are [[citizens]], but add in the one case that they are not of [[age]], and in the other, that they are [[past]] the [[age]], or something of that sort; the precise expression is immaterial, for our meaning is clear. similar difficulties to those which i have mentioned may be raised and answered about deprived [[citizens]] and about exiles. but the citizen whom we are seeking to define is a citizen in the strictest sense, against whom no such exception can be taken, and his special characteristic is that he shares in the administration of [[justice]], and in offices. now of offices some are discontinuous, and the same persons [[person]] are not allowed to hold them twice, or can only hold them after a fixed interval; others have no limit of time- for [[example]], the office of a dicast or ecclesiast. it may, indeed, be argued that these are not magistrates at all, and that their functions give them no share in the [[government]]. but surely it is ridiculous to say that those who have the [[power]] do not govern. let us not dwell further upon this, which is a purely verbal [[question]]; what we want is a [[common]] term including both dicast and ecclesiast. let us, for the sake of distinction, call it 'indefinite office,' and we will assume that those who share in such office are [[citizens]]. this is the most comprehensive definition of a citizen, and [[best]] suits all those who are generally so called. 

but we must not forget that things of which the underlying principles [[principle]] differ in [[kind]], one of them being first, another second, another third, have, when regarded in this relation, nothing, or hardly anything, worth mentioning in [[common]]. now we see that governments [[government]] differ in [[kind]], and that some of them are prior and that others are posterior; those which are faulty or perverted are necessarily posterior to those which are [[perfect]]. (what we mean by perversion will be hereafter explained.) the citizen then of necessity differs under each form of [[government]]; and our definition is [[best]] adapted to the citizen of a [[democracy]]; but not necessarily to other states. for in some states the [[people]] are not acknowledged, nor have they any regular assembly, but only extraordinary ones; and suits are distributed by sections among the magistrates. at lacedaemon, for instance, the ephors determine suits about contracts, which they distribute among themselves, while the elders are judges [[judge]] of homicide, and other causes are decided by other magistrates. a similar [[principle]] prevails at [[carthage]]; there [[certain]] magistrates decide all causes. we may, indeed, modify our definition of the citizen so as to include these states. in them it is the holder of a definite, not of an indefinite office, who legislates and judges [[judge]], and to some or all such holders of definite offices is reserved the [[right]] of deliberating or judging about some things or about all things. the conception of the citizen now begins to clear up. 

he who has the [[power]] to take part in the deliberative or judicial administration of any [[state]] is said by us to be a [[citizens]] of that [[state]]; and, speaking generally, a [[state]] is a [[body]] of [[citizens]] sufficing for the purposes [[purpose]] of [[life]]. 

part ii 

but in practice a citizen is defined to be one of whom both the parents are [[citizens]]; others insist on going further back; say to two or three or more [[ancestors]]. this is a short and practical definition but there are some who raise the further [[question]]: how this third or fourth ancestor came to be a citizen? gorgias of leontini, partly because he was in a difficulty, partly in irony, said- 'mortars are what is made by the mortar-makers, and the [[citizens]] of larissa are those who are made by the magistrates; for it is their [[trade]] to make larissaeans.' yet the [[question]] is really simple, for, if according to the definition just given they shared in the [[government]], they were [[citizens]]. this is a [[better]] definition than the other. for the words, 'born of a [[father]] or [[mother]] who is a citizen,' cannot possibly apply to the first inhabitants or founders of a [[state]]. 

there is a greater difficulty in the case of those who have been made [[citizens]] after a [[revolution]], as by cleisthenes at [[athens]] after the expulsion of the tyrants [[tyrant]], for he enrolled in tribes many metics, both strangers and slaves [[slave]]. the [[doubt]] in these cases is, not who is, but whether he who is ought to be a citizen; and there will still be a furthering the [[state]], whether a [[certain]] act is or is not an act of the [[state]]; for what ought not to be is what is false. now, there are some who hold office, and yet ought not to hold office, whom we describe as ruling, but ruling unjustly. and the citizen was defined by the [[fact]] of his holding some [[kind]] of [[rule]] or office- he who holds a judicial or legislative office fulfills our definition of a citizen. it is evident, therefore, that the [[citizens]] about whom the [[doubt]] has arisen must be called [[citizens]]. 

part iii 

whether they ought to be so or not is a [[question]] which is bound up with the previous inquiry. for a parallel [[question]] is raised respecting the [[state]], whether a [[certain]] act is or is not an act of the [[state]]; for [[example]], in the transition from an [[oligarchy]] or a [[tyranny]] to a [[democracy]]. in such cases persons [[person]] refuse to fulfill their contracts or any other obligations, on the ground that the [[tyrant]], and not the [[state]], contracted them; they argue that some constitutions [[constitution]] are established by [[force]], and not for the sake of the [[common]] [[good]]. but this would apply equally to democracies [[democracy]], for they too may be founded on [[violence]], and then the acts of the [[democracy]] will be neither more nor less acts of the [[state]] in [[question]] than those of an [[oligarchy]] or of a [[tyranny]]. this [[question]] runs up into another: on what [[principle]] shall we ever say that the [[state]] is the same, or different? it would be a very superficial view which considered only the place and the inhabitants (for the soil and the [[population]] may be separated, and some of the inhabitants may [[live]] in one place and some in another). this, however, is not a very serious difficulty; we need only remark that the word 'state' is ambiguous. 

it is further [[asked]]: when are [[men]], living in the same place, to be regarded as a [[single]] city- what is the limit? certainly not the wall of the [[city]], for you might surround all peloponnesus with a wall. like this, we may say, is [[babylon]], and every [[city]] that has the compass of a nation rather than a [[city]]; [[babylon]], they say, had been taken for three days before some part of the inhabitants became aware of the [[fact]]. this difficulty may, however, with advantage be deferred to another [[occasion]]; the statesman has to consider the size of the [[state]], and whether it should consist of more than one nation or not. 

again, shall we say that while the [[race]] of inhabitants, as well as their place of abode, remain the same, the [[city]] is also the same, although the [[citizens]] are always dying and being born, as we call rivers and fountains the same, although the water is always flowing away and coming again or shall we say that the generations [[generation]] of [[men]], like the rivers, are the same, but that the [[state]] changes [[change]]? for, since the [[state]] is a partnership, and is a partnership of [[citizens]] in a [[constitution]], when the form of [[government]] changes [[change]], and becomes different, then it may be supposed that the [[state]] is no longer the same, just as a tragic differs from a comic chorus, although the members of both may be identical. and in this manner we speak of every union or composition of elements as different when the form of their composition alters; for [[example]], a scale containing the same sounds is said to be different, accordingly as the dorian or the phrygian mode is employed. and if this is true it is evident that the sameness of the [[state]] consists chiefly in the sameness of the [[constitution]], and it may be called or not called by the same name, whether the inhabitants are the same or entirely different. it is quite another [[question]], whether a [[state]] ought or ought not to fulfill engagements when the form of [[government]] changes [[change]]. 

part iv 

there is a point nearly allied to the preceding: whether the [[virtue]] of a [[good]] [[man]] and a [[good]] citizen is the same or not. but, before entering on this discussion, we must certainly first obtain some general notion of the [[virtue]] of the citizen. like the sailor, the citizen is a member of a [[community]]. now, sailors have different functions, for one of them is a rower, another a pilot, and a third a look-out [[man]], a fourth is described by some similar term; and while the precise definition of each individual's [[virtue]] applies exclusively to him, there is, at the same [[time]], a [[common]] definition applicable to them all. for they have all of them a [[common]] object, which is safety in navigation. similarly, one citizen differs from another, but the salvation of the [[community]] is the [[common]] [[business]] of them all. this [[community]] is the [[constitution]]; the [[virtue]] of the citizen must therefore be relative to the [[constitution]] of which he is a member. if, then, there are many forms of [[government]], it is evident that there is not one [[single]] [[virtue]] of the [[good]] citizen which is [[perfect]] [[virtue]]. but we say that the [[good]] [[man]] is he who has one [[single]] [[virtue]] which is [[perfect]] [[virtue]]. hence it is evident that the [[good]] citizen need not of necessity possess the [[virtue]] which makes a [[good]] [[man]]. 

the same [[question]] may also be approached by another road, from a consideration of the [[best]] [[constitution]]. if the [[state]] cannot be entirely composed of [[good]] [[men]], and yet each citizen is expected to do his own [[business]] well, and must therefore have [[virtue]], still inasmuch as all the [[citizens]] cannot be alike, the [[virtue]] of the citizen and of the [[good]] [[man]] cannot coincide. all must have the [[virtue]] of the [[good]] citizen- thus, and thus only, can the [[state]] be [[perfect]]; but they will not have the [[virtue]] of a [[good]] [[man]], unless we assume that in the [[good]] [[state]] all the [[citizens]] must be [[good]]. 

again, the [[state]], as composed of unlikes, may be compared to the living being: as the first elements into which a living being is resolved are [[soul]] and [[body]], as [[soul]] is made up of [[rational]] [[principle]] and appetite, the [[family]] of husband and [[wife]], [[property]] of master and [[slave]], so of all these, as well as other dissimilar elements, the [[state]] is composed; and, therefore, the [[virtue]] of all the [[citizens]] cannot possibly be the same, any more than the excellence of the leader of a chorus is the same as that of the performer who stands by his side. i have said enough to show why the two kinds [[kind]] of [[virtue]] cannot be absolutely and always the same. 

but will there then be no case in which the [[virtue]] of the [[good]] citizen and the [[virtue]] of the [[good]] [[man]] coincide? to this we [[answer]] that the [[good]] ruler is a [[good]] and [[wise]] [[man]], and that he who would be a statesman must be a [[wise]] [[man]]. and some persons [[person]] say that even the [[education]] of the ruler should be of a special [[kind]]; for are not the [[children]] of kings [[king]] instructed in riding and [[military]] exercises? as euripides says: 

"no subtle [[arts]] for me, but what the [[state]] requires. "

as though there were a special [[education]] needed by a ruler. if then the [[virtue]] of a [[good]] ruler is the same as that of a [[good]] [[man]], and we assume further that the [[subject]] is a citizen as well as the ruler, the [[virtue]] of the [[good]] citizen and the [[virtue]] of the [[good]] [[man]] cannot be absolutely the same, although in some cases they may; for the [[virtue]] of a ruler differs from that of a citizen. it was the sense of this difference which made jason say that 'he [[felt]] hungry when he was not a [[tyrant]],' meaning that he could not endure to [[live]] in a private station. but, on the other hand, it may be argued that [[men]] are praised for knowing both how to [[rule]] and how to obey, and he is said to be a citizen of approved [[virtue]] who is able to do both. now if we suppose the [[virtue]] of a [[good]] [[man]] to be that which rules [[rule]], and the [[virtue]] of the citizen to include ruling and obeying, it cannot be said that they are equally worthy of [[praise]]. since, then, it is sometimes [[thought]] that the ruler and the ruled must learn different things and not the same, but that the citizen must [[know]] and share in them both, the inference is obvious. there is, indeed, the [[rule]] of a master, which is concerned with menial offices- the master need not [[know]] how to perform these, but may employ others in the execution of them: the other would be degrading; and by the other i mean the [[power]] actually to do menial duties [[duty]], which vary much in [[character]] and are executed by various classes of slaves [[slave]], such, for [[example]], as handicraftsmen, who, as their name signifies, [[live]] by the labor of their hands: under these the mechanic is included. hence in ancient times [[time]], and among some nations, the working classes had no share in the government- a [[privilege]] which they only acquired under the extreme [[democracy]]. certainly the [[good]] [[man]] and the statesman and the [[good]] citizen ought not to learn the crafts of inferiors except for their own occasional use; if they habitually practice them, there will cease to be a distinction between master and [[slave]]. 

this is not the [[rule]] of which we are speaking; but there is a [[rule]] of another [[kind]], which is exercised over freemen and equals [[equal]] by birth -a constitutional [[rule]], which the ruler must learn by obeying, as he would learn the duties [[duty]] of a general of cavalry by being under the orders of a general of cavalry, or the duties [[duty]] of a general of infantry by being under the orders of a general of infantry, and by having had the command of a regiment and of a company. it has been well said that 'he who has never learned to obey cannot be a [[good]] commander.' the two are not the same, but the [[good]] citizen ought to be capable of both; he should [[know]] how to govern like a freeman, and how to obey like a freeman- these are the virtues [[virtue]] of a citizen. and, although the temperance and [[justice]] of a ruler are distinct from those of a [[subject]], the [[virtue]] of a [[good]] [[man]] will include both; for the [[virtue]] of the [[good]] [[man]] who is [[free]] and also a [[subject]], e.g., his [[justice]], will not be one but will comprise distinct kinds [[kind]], the one qualifying him to [[rule]], the other to obey, and differing as the temperance and [[courage]] of [[men]] and [[women]] differ. for a [[man]] would be [[thought]] a [[coward]] if he had no more [[courage]] than a courageous woman, and a woman would be [[thought]] loquacious if she imposed no more restraint on her conversation than the [[good]] [[man]]; and indeed their part in the management of the household is different, for the [[duty]] of the one is to acquire, and of the other to preserve. practical [[wisdom]] only is characteristic of the ruler: it would seem that all other virtues [[virtue]] must equally belong to ruler and [[subject]]. the [[virtue]] of the [[subject]] is certainly not [[wisdom]], but only true [[opinion]]; he may be compared to the maker of the flute, while his master is like the flute-player or user of the flute. 

from these considerations may be gathered the [[answer]] to the [[question]], whether the [[virtue]] of the [[good]] [[man]] is the same as that of the [[good]] citizen, or different, and how far the same, and how far different. 

part v 

there still remains one more [[question]] about the citizen: is he only a true citizen who has a share of office, or is the mechanic to be included? if they who hold no office are to be deemed [[citizens]], not every citizen can have this [[virtue]] of ruling and obeying; for this [[man]] is a citizen and if none of the lower class are [[citizens]], in which part of the [[state]] are they to be placed? for they are not resident aliens, and they are not foreigners. may we not reply, that as far as this objection goes there is no more absurdity in excluding them than in excluding slaves [[slave]] and freedmen from any of the above-mentioned classes? it must be admitted that we cannot consider all those to be [[citizens]] who are necessary to the existence of the [[state]]; for [[example]], [[children]] are not citizen equally with grown-up [[men]], who are [[citizens]] absolutely, but [[children]], not being grown up, are only [[citizens]] on a [[certain]] assumption. nay, in ancient times [[time]], and among some nations the artisan class were slaves [[slave]] or foreigners, and therefore the majority of them are so now. the [[best]] form of [[state]] will not admit them to citizenship; but if they are admitted, then our definition of the [[virtue]] of a citizen will not apply to every citizen nor to every [[free]] [[man]] as such, but only to those who are freed from necessary services. the necessary [[people]] are either slaves [[slave]] who minister to the wants of individuals [[individual]], or mechanics and laborers who are the servants of the [[community]]. these reflections carried a little further will explain their position; and indeed what has been said already is of itself, when understood, explanation enough. 

since there are many forms of [[government]] there must be many varieties of citizen and especially of [[citizens]] who are subjects [[subject]]; so that under some governments [[government]] the mechanic and the laborer will be [[citizens]], but not in others, as, for [[example]], in [[aristocracy]] or the so-called [[government]] of the [[best]] (if there be such an one), in which honors are given according to [[virtue]] and [[merit]]; for no [[man]] can practice [[virtue]] who is living the [[life]] of a mechanic or laborer. in oligarchies the qualification for office is high, and therefore no laborer can ever be a citizen; but a mechanic may, for an actual majority of them are [[rich]]. at thebes there was a [[law]] that no [[man]] could hold office who had not retired from [[business]] for ten years. but in many states the [[law]] goes to the length of admitting aliens; for in some democracies [[democracy]] a [[man]] is a citizen though his [[mother]] only be a citizen; and a similar [[principle]] is applied to illegitimate [[children]]; the [[law]] is relaxed when there is a dearth of [[population]]. but when the number of [[citizens]] increases, first the [[children]] of a male or a female [[slave]] are excluded; then those whose mothers [[mother]] only are [[citizens]]; and at [[last]] the [[right]] of citizenship is confined to those whose fathers [[father]] and mothers [[mother]] are both [[citizens]]. 

hence, as is evident, there are different kinds [[kind]] of [[citizens]]; and he is a citizen in the highest sense who shares in the honors of the [[state]]. compare homer's words, 'like some dishonored stranger'; he who is excluded from the honors of the [[state]] is no [[better]] than an alien. but when his exclusion is concealed, then the object is that the privileged class may [[deceive]] their fellow inhabitants. 

as to the [[question]] whether the [[virtue]] of the [[good]] [[man]] is the same as that of the [[good]] citizen, the considerations already adduced prove that in some states the [[good]] [[man]] and the [[good]] citizen are the same, and in others different. when they are the same it is not every citizen who is a [[good]] [[man]], but only the statesman and those who have or may have, alone or in conjunction with others, the conduct of [[public]] affairs. 

part vi 

having determined these questions [[question]], we have next to consider whether there is only one form of [[government]] or many, and if many, what they are, and how many, and what are the differences between them. 

a [[constitution]] is the arrangement of magistracies in a [[state]], especially of the highest of all. the [[government]] is everywhere [[sovereign]] in the [[state]], and the [[constitution]] is in [[fact]] the [[government]]. for [[example]], in democracies [[democracy]] the [[people]] are supreme, but in oligarchies, the few; and, therefore, we say that these two forms of [[government]] also are different: and so in other cases. 

first, let us consider what is the [[purpose]] of a [[state]], and how many forms of [[government]] there are by which [[human]] [[society]] is regulated. we have already said, in the first part of this treatise, when discussing household management and the [[rule]] of a master, that [[man]] is by [[nature]] a [[political]] animal. and therefore, [[men]], even when they do not require one another's [[help]], [[desire]] to [[live]] together; not but that they are also brought together by their [[common]] interests in proportion as they severally attain to any measure of well-being. this is certainly the [[chief]] end, both of individuals [[individual]] and of states. and also for the sake of mere [[life]] (in which there is possibly some [[noble]] element so long as the evils [[evil]] of existence do not greatly overbalance the good) [[mankind]] meet together and maintain the [[political]] [[community]]. and we all see that [[men]] cling to [[life]] even at the cost of enduring [[great]] misfortune, seeming to find in [[life]] a [[natural]] sweetness and [[happiness]]. 

there is no difficulty in distinguishing the various kinds [[kind]] of [[authority]]; they have been often defined already in discussions outside the school. the [[rule]] of a master, although the [[slave]] by [[nature]] and the master by [[nature]] have in reality the same interests, is nevertheless exercised primarily with a view to the interest of the master, but accidentally considers the [[slave]], since, if the [[slave]] perish, the [[rule]] of the master perishes with him. on the other hand, the [[government]] of a [[wife]] and [[children]] and of a household, which we have called household management, is exercised in the first instance for the [[good]] of the governed or for the [[common]] [[good]] of both parties, but essentially for the [[good]] of the governed, as we see to be the case in medicine, gymnastic, and the [[arts]] in general, which are only accidentally concerned with the [[good]] of the artists themselves. for there is no [[reason]] why the trainer may not sometimes practice gymnastics, and the helmsman is always one of the crew. the trainer or the helmsman considers the [[good]] of those committed to his [[care]]. but, when he is one of the persons [[person]] taken [[care]] of, he accidentally participates in the advantage, for the helmsman is also a sailor, and the trainer becomes one of those in training. and so in [[politics]]: when the [[state]] is framed upon the [[principle]] of equality and likeness, the [[citizens]] [[think]] that they ought to hold office by turns. formerly, as is [[natural]], every one would take his turn of service; and then again, somebody else would look after his interest, just as he, while in office, had looked after theirs. but nowadays, for the sake of the advantage which is to be gained from the [[public]] revenues [[revenue]] and from office, [[men]] want to be always in office. one might imagine that the rulers, being sickly, were only kept in health while they continued in office; in that case we may be sure that they would be hunting after places. the conclusion is evident: that governments [[government]] which have a regard to the [[common]] interest are constituted in accordance with strict principles [[principle]] of [[justice]], and are therefore true forms; but those which regard only the interest of the rulers are all defective and perverted forms, for they are despotic, whereas a [[state]] is a [[community]] of freemen. 

part vii 

having determined these points, we have next to consider how many forms of [[government]] there are, and what they are; and in the first place what are the true forms, for when they are determined the perversions of them will at once be apparent. the words [[constitution]] and [[government]] have the same meaning, and the [[government]], which is the supreme [[authority]] in states, must be in the hands of one, or of a few, or of the many. the true forms of [[government]], therefore, are those in which the one, or the few, or the many, govern with a view to the [[common]] interest; but governments [[government]] which [[rule]] with a view to the private interest, whether of the one or of the few, or of the many, are perversions. for the members of a [[state]], if they are truly [[citizens]], ought to participate in its advantages. of forms of [[government]] in which one rules [[rule]], we call that which regards the [[common]] interests, kingship or royalty; that in which more than one, but not many, [[rule]], [[aristocracy]]; and it is so called, either because the rulers are the [[best]] [[men]], or because they have at [[heart]] the [[best]] interests of the [[state]] and of the [[citizens]]. but when the [[citizens]] at large administer the [[state]] for the [[common]] interest, the [[government]] is called by the generic name- a [[constitution]]. and there is a [[reason]] for this use of [[language]]. one [[man]] or a few may excel in [[virtue]]; but as the number increases it becomes more difficult for them to attain [[perfection]] in every [[kind]] of [[virtue]], though they may in [[military]] [[virtue]], for this is found in the masses. hence in a constitutional [[government]] the fighting-men have the supreme [[power]], and those who possess arms are the [[citizens]]. 

of the above-mentioned forms, the perversions are as follows: of royalty, [[tyranny]]; of [[aristocracy]], [[oligarchy]]; of constitutional [[government]], [[democracy]]. for [[tyranny]] is a [[kind]] of [[monarchy]] which has in view the interest of the monarch only; [[oligarchy]] has in view the interest of the wealthy; [[democracy]], of the needy: none of them the [[common]] [[good]] of all.

but there are difficulties about these forms of [[government]], and it will therefore be necessary to [[state]] a little more at length the [[nature]] of each of them. for he who would make a philosophical study of the various sciences [[science]], and does not regard practice only, ought not to overlook or omit anything, but to set forth the [[truth]] in every particular. [[tyranny]], as i was saying, is [[monarchy]] exercising the [[rule]] of a master over the [[political]] [[society]]; [[oligarchy]] is when [[men]] of [[property]] have the [[government]] in their hands; [[democracy]], the opposite, when the indigent, and not the [[men]] of [[property]], are the rulers. and here arises the first of our difficulties, and it relates to the distinction drawn. for [[democracy]] is said to be the [[government]] of the many. but what if the many are [[men]] of [[property]] and have the [[power]] in their hands? in like manner [[oligarchy]] is said to be the [[government]] of the few; but what if the [[poor]] are fewer than the [[rich]], and have the [[power]] in their hands because they are stronger? in these cases the distinction which we have drawn between these different forms of [[government]] would no longer hold [[good]]. 

suppose, once more, that we add [[wealth]] to the few and [[poverty]] to the many, and name the governments [[government]] accordingly- an [[oligarchy]] is said to be that in which the few and the wealthy, and a [[democracy]] that in which the many and the [[poor]] are the rulers- there will still be a difficulty. for, if the only forms of [[government]] are the ones already mentioned, how shall we describe those other governments [[government]] also just mentioned by us, in which the [[rich]] are the more numerous and the [[poor]] are the fewer, and both govern in their respective states? 

the argument seems to show that, whether in oligarchies or in democracies [[democracy]], the number of the governing [[body]], whether the greater number, as in a [[democracy]], or the smaller number, as in an [[oligarchy]], is an accident due to the [[fact]] that the [[rich]] everywhere are few, and the [[poor]] numerous. but if so, there is a misapprehension of the causes of the difference between them. for the real difference between [[democracy]] and [[oligarchy]] is [[poverty]] and [[wealth]]. wherever [[men]] [[rule]] by [[reason]] of their [[wealth]], whether they be few or many, that is an [[oligarchy]], and where the [[poor]] [[rule]], that is a [[democracy]]. but as a [[fact]] the [[rich]] are few and the [[poor]] many; for few are well-to-do, whereas [[freedom]] is enjoyed by an, and [[wealth]] and [[freedom]] are the grounds on which the oligarchical and democratical parties respectively claim [[power]] in the [[state]]. 

part ix 

let us begin by considering the [[common]] definitions of [[oligarchy]] and [[democracy]], and what is [[justice]] oligarchical and democratical. for all [[men]] cling to [[justice]] of some [[kind]], but their conceptions are imperfect and they do not express the whole [[idea]]. for [[example]], [[justice]] is [[thought]] by them to be, and is, equality, not. however, for however, for but only for equals [[equal]]. and inequality is [[thought]] to be, and is, [[justice]]; neither is this for all, but only for unequals. when the persons [[person]] are omitted, then [[men]] [[judge]] erroneously. the [[reason]] is that they are passing [[judgment]] on themselves, and most [[people]] are [[bad]] judges [[judge]] in their own case. and whereas [[justice]] implies a relation to persons [[person]] as well as to things, and a just distribution, as i have already said in the ethics, implies the same ratio between the persons [[person]] and between the things, they agree about the equality of the things, but dispute about the equality of the persons [[person]], chiefly for the [[reason]] which i have just given- because they are [[bad]] judges [[judge]] in their own affairs; and secondly, because both the parties to the argument are speaking of a limited and partial [[justice]], but imagine themselves to be speaking of absolute [[justice]]. for the one party, if they are unequal in one [[respect]], for [[example]] [[wealth]], consider themselves to be unequal in all; and the other party, if they are [[equal]] in one [[respect]], for [[example]] [[free]] birth, consider themselves to be [[equal]] in all. but they leave out the [[capital]] point. for if [[men]] met and associated out of regard to [[wealth]] only, their share in the [[state]] would be proportioned to their [[property]], and the oligarchical doctrine would then seem to carry the day. it would not be just that he who paid one mina should have the same share of a hundred minae, whether of the principal or of the profits [[profit]], as he who paid the remaining ninety-nine. but a [[state]] exists for the sake of a [[good]] [[life]], and not for the sake of [[life]] only: if [[life]] only were the object, slaves [[slave]] and brute animals might form a [[state]], but they cannot, for they have no share in [[happiness]] or in a [[life]] of [[free]] [[choice]]. nor does a [[state]] [[exist]] for the sake of [[alliance]] and security from [[injustice]], nor yet for the sake of exchange and mutual intercourse; for then the tyrrhenians and the carthaginians, and all who have commercial treaties with one another, would be the [[citizens]] of one [[state]]. true, they have agreements about imports, and engagements that they will do no [[wrong]] to one another, and written articles of [[alliance]]. but there are no magistrates [[common]] to the contracting parties who will enforce their engagements; different states have each their own magistracies. nor does one [[state]] take [[care]] that the [[citizens]] of the other are such as they ought to be, nor see that those who come under the terms of the treaty do no [[wrong]] or wickedness at an, but only that they do no [[injustice]] to one another. whereas, those who [[care]] for [[good]] [[government]] take into consideration [[virtue]] and [[vice]] in states. whence it may be further inferred that [[virtue]] must be the [[care]] of a [[state]] which is truly so called, and not merely enjoys the name: for without this end the [[community]] becomes a mere [[alliance]] which differs only in place from alliances of which the members [[live]] apart; and [[law]] is only a convention, 'a surety to one another of [[justice]],' as the sophist lycophron says, and has no real [[power]] to make the [[citizens]] 

this is obvious; for suppose distinct places, such as corinth and megara, to be brought together so that their walls touched, still they would not be one [[city]], not even if the [[citizens]] had the [[right]] to intermarry, which is one of the rights [[right]] peculiarly characteristic of states. again, if [[men]] dwelt at a distance from one another, but not so far off as to have no intercourse, and there were laws [[law]] among them that they should not [[wrong]] each other in their exchanges, neither would this be a [[state]]. let us suppose that one [[man]] is a carpenter, another a husbandman, another a shoemaker, and so on, and that their number is ten thousand: nevertheless, if they have nothing in [[common]] but exchange, [[alliance]], and the like, that would not constitute a [[state]]. why is this? surely not because they are at a distance from one another: for even supposing that such a [[community]] were to meet in one place, but that each [[man]] had a house of his own, which was in a manner his [[state]], and that they made [[alliance]] with one another, but only against evil-doers; still an accurate thinker would not deem this to be a [[state]], if their intercourse with one another was of the same [[character]] after as before their union. it is clear then that a [[state]] is not a mere [[society]], having a [[common]] place, established for the prevention of mutual crime and for the sake of exchange. these are conditions without which a [[state]] cannot [[exist]]; but all of them together do not constitute a [[state]], which is a [[community]] of families [[family]] and aggregations of families [[family]] in well-being, for the sake of a [[perfect]] and self-sufficing [[life]]. such a [[community]] can only be established among those who [[live]] in the same place and intermarry. hence arise in cities [[city]] [[family]] connections, brotherhoods, [[common]] sacrifices [[sacrifice]], amusements which draw [[men]] together. but these are created by [[friendship]], for the will to [[live]] together is [[friendship]]. the end of the [[state]] is the [[good]] [[life]], and these are the means towards it. and the [[state]] is the union of families [[family]] and villages in a [[perfect]] and self-sufficing [[life]], by which we mean a [[happy]] and honorable [[life]]. 

our conclusion, then, is that [[political]] [[society]] exists for the sake of [[noble]] actions, and not of mere companionship. hence they who contribute most to such a [[society]] have a greater share in it than those who have the same or a greater [[freedom]] or nobility of birth but are inferior to them in [[political]] [[virtue]]; or than those who exceed them in [[wealth]] but are surpassed by them in [[virtue]]. 

from what has been said it will be clearly seen that all the partisans of different forms of [[government]] speak of a part of [[justice]] only. 

part x 

there is also a [[doubt]] as to what is to be the supreme [[power]] in the [[state]]: is it the multitude? or the wealthy? or the [[good]]? or the one [[best]] [[man]]? or a [[tyrant]]? any of these alternatives seems to involve disagreeable consequences. if the [[poor]], for [[example]], because they are more in number, divide among themselves the [[property]] of the rich- is not this [[unjust]]? no, by [[heaven]] (will be the reply), for the supreme [[authority]] justly willed it. but if this is not [[injustice]], [[pray]] what is? again, when in the first division all has been taken, and the majority divide anew the [[property]] of the minority, is it not evident, if this goes on, that they will ruin the [[state]]? yet surely, [[virtue]] is not the ruin of those who possess her, nor is [[justice]] destructive of a [[state]]; and therefore this [[law]] of confiscation clearly cannot be just. if it were, all the acts of a [[tyrant]] must of necessity be just; for he only coerces other [[men]] by superior [[power]], just as the multitude coerce the [[rich]]. but is it just then that the few and the wealthy should be the rulers? and what if they, in like manner, rob and plunder the people- is this just? if so, the other case will likewise be just. but there can be no [[doubt]] that all these things are [[wrong]] and [[unjust]]. 

then ought the [[good]] to [[rule]] and have supreme [[power]]? but in that case everybody else, being excluded from [[power]], will be dishonored. for the offices of a [[state]] are posts of [[honor]]; and if one set of [[men]] always holds them, the rest must be deprived of them. then will it be well that the one [[best]] [[man]] should [[rule]]? nay, that is still more oligarchical, for the number of those who are dishonored is thereby increased. some one may say that it is [[bad]] in any case for a [[man]], [[subject]] as he is to all the accidents of [[human]] passion, to have the supreme [[power]], rather than the [[law]]. but what if the [[law]] itself be democratical or oligarchical, how will that [[help]] us out of our difficulties? not at all; the same consequences will [[follow]]. 

part xi 

most of these questions [[question]] may be reserved for another [[occasion]]. the [[principle]] that the multitude ought to be supreme rather than the few [[best]] is one that is maintained, and, though not [[free]] from difficulty, yet seems to contain an element of [[truth]]. for the many, of whom each [[individual]] is but an ordinary [[person]], when they meet together may very likely be [[better]] than the few [[good]], if regarded not individually but collectively, just as a feast to which many contribute is [[better]] than a dinner provided out of a [[single]] purse. for each [[individual]] among the many has a share of [[virtue]] and prudence, and when they meet together, they become in a manner one [[man]], who has many feet, and hands, and senses; that is a figure of their [[mind]] and disposition. hence the many are [[better]] judges [[judge]] than a [[single]] [[man]] of [[music]] and poetry; for some [[understand]] one part, and some another, and among them they [[understand]] the whole. there is a similar combination of qualities in [[good]] [[men]], who differ from any [[individual]] of the many, as the beautiful are said to differ from those who are not beautiful, and works [[work]] of art [[arts]] from realities, because in them the scattered elements are combined, although, if taken separately, the eye of one [[person]] or some other feature in another [[person]] would be fairer than in the picture. whether this [[principle]] can apply to every [[democracy]], and to all bodies [[body]] of [[men]], is not clear. or rather, by [[heaven]], in some cases it is impossible of application; for the argument would equally hold about brutes; and wherein, it will be [[asked]], do some [[men]] differ from brutes? but there may be bodies [[body]] of [[men]] about whom our statement is nevertheless true. and if so, the difficulty which has been already raised, and also another which is akin to it -viz., what [[power]] should be assigned to the mass of freemen and [[citizens]], who are not [[rich]] and have no personal merit- are both solved. there is still a danger in aflowing them to share the [[great]] offices of [[state]], for their folly will lead them into error, and their dishonesty into crime. but there is a danger also in not letting them share, for a [[state]] in which many [[poor]] [[men]] are excluded from office will necessarily be full of enemies [[enemy]]. the only way of escape is to assign to them some deliberative and judicial functions. for this [[reason]] solon and [[certain]] other legislators give them the [[power]] of electing to offices, and of calling the magistrates to account, but they do not allow them to hold office singly. when they meet together their perceptions are quite [[good]] enough, and combined with the [[better]] class they are useful to the [[state]] (just as impure food when mixed with what is pure sometimes makes the entire mass more wholesome than a small quantity of the pure would be), but each [[individual]], left to himself, forms an imperfect [[judgment]]. on the other hand, the popular form of [[government]] involves [[certain]] difficulties. in the first place, it might be objected that he who can [[judge]] of the healing of a sick [[man]] would be one who could himself heal his disease, and make him whole- that is, in other words, the physician; and so in all professions and [[arts]]. as, then, the physician ought to be called to account by physicians, so ought [[men]] in general to be called to account by their peers. but physicians are of three kinds [[kind]]: there is the ordinary practitioner, and there is the physician of the higher class, and thirdly the [[intelligent]] [[man]] who has [[studied]] the art [[arts]]: in all [[arts]] there is such a class; and we attribute the [[power]] of judging to them quite as much as to professors of the art [[arts]]. secondly, does not the same [[principle]] apply to elections? for a [[right]] election can only be made by those who have [[knowledge]]; those who [[know]] geometry, for [[example]], will choose a geometrician rightly, and those who [[know]] how to steer, a pilot; and, even if there be some occupations and [[arts]] in which private persons [[person]] share in the ability to choose, they certainly cannot choose [[better]] than those who [[know]]. so that, according to this argument, neither the election of magistrates, nor the calling of them to account, should be entrusted to the many. yet possibly these objections are to a [[great]] extent met by our old [[answer]], that if the [[people]] are not utterly degraded, although individually they may be worse judges [[judge]] than those who have special knowledge- as a [[body]] they are as [[good]] or [[better]]. moreover, there are some [[arts]] whose products are not judged of solely, or [[best]], by the artists themselves, namely those [[arts]] whose products are recognized even by those who do not possess the art [[arts]]; for [[example]], the [[knowledge]] of the house is not limited to the builder only; the user, or, in other words, the master, of the house will be even a [[better]] [[judge]] than the builder, just as the pilot will [[judge]] [[better]] of a rudder than the carpenter, and the guest will [[judge]] [[better]] of a feast than the cook. 

this difficulty seems now to be sufficiently answered, but there is another akin to it. that inferior persons [[person]] should have [[authority]] in greater matters than the [[good]] would appear to be a [[strange]] thing, yet the election and calling to account of the magistrates is the [[greatest]] of all. and these, as i was saying, are functions which in some states are assigned to the [[people]], for the assembly is supreme in all such matters. yet persons [[person]] of any [[age]], and having but a small [[property]] qualification, sit in the assembly and deliberate and [[judge]], although for the [[great]] officers of [[state]], such as treasurers and generals, a high qualification is required. this difficulty may be solved in the same manner as the preceding, and the [[present]] practice of democracies [[democracy]] may be really defensible. for the [[power]] does not reside in the dicast, or senator, or ecclesiast, but in the court, and the senate, and the assembly, of which [[individual]] senators, or ecclesiasts, or dicasts, are only parts or members. and for this [[reason]] the many may claim to have a higher [[authority]] than the few; for the [[people]], and the senate, and the courts consist of many persons [[person]], and their [[property]] collectively is greater than the [[property]] of one or of a few individuals [[individual]] holding [[great]] offices. but enough of this. 

the discussion of the first [[question]] shows nothing so clearly as that laws [[law]], when [[good]], should be supreme; and that the magistrate or magistrates should regulate those matters only on which the laws [[law]] are unable to speak with precision owing to the difficulty of any general [[principle]] embracing all particulars. but what are [[good]] laws [[law]] has not yet been clearly explained; the old difficulty remains. the goodness or badness, [[justice]] or [[injustice]], of laws [[law]] varies of necessity with the constitutions [[constitution]] of states. this, however, is clear, that the laws [[law]] must be adapted to the constitutions [[constitution]]. but if so, true forms of [[government]] will of necessity have just laws [[law]], and perverted forms of [[government]] will have [[unjust]] laws [[law]]. 

part xii 

in all sciences [[science]] and [[arts]] the end is a [[good]], and the [[greatest]] [[good]] and in the highest [[degree]] a [[good]] in the most authoritative of all- this is the [[political]] [[science]] of which the [[good]] is [[justice]], in other words, the [[common]] interest. all [[men]] [[think]] [[justice]] to be a sort of equality; and to a [[certain]] extent they agree in the philosophical distinctions which have been laid down by us about ethics. for they admit that [[justice]] is a thing and has a relation to persons [[person]], and that equals [[equal]] ought to have equality. but there still remains a [[question]]: equality or inequality of what? here is a difficulty which calls for [[political]] speculation. for very likely some persons [[person]] will say that offices of [[state]] ought to be unequally distributed according to superior excellence, in whatever [[respect]], of the citizen, although there is no other difference between him and the rest of the [[community]]; for that those who differ in any one [[respect]] have different rights [[right]] and claims. but, surely, if this is true, the [[complexion]] or height of a [[man]], or any other advantage, will be a [[reason]] for his obtaining a greater share of [[political]] rights [[right]]. the error here lies [[lie]] upon the surface, and may be illustrated from the other [[arts]] and sciences [[science]]. when a number of flute players are [[equal]] in their art [[arts]], there is no [[reason]] why those of them who are [[better]] born should have [[better]] flutes given to them; for they will not play any [[better]] on the flute, and the superior instrument should be reserved for him who is the superior artist. if what i am saying is still obscure, it will be made clearer as we proceed. for if there were a superior flute-player who was far inferior in birth and [[beauty]], although either of these may be a greater [[good]] than the art [[arts]] of flute-playing, and may excel flute-playing in a greater ratio than he excels the others in his art [[arts]], still he ought to have the [[best]] flutes given to him, unless the advantages of [[wealth]] and birth contribute to excellence in flute-playing, which they do not. moreover, upon this [[principle]] any [[good]] may be compared with any other. for if a given height may be measured [[wealth]] and against [[freedom]], height in general may be so measured. thus if a excels in height more than b in [[virtue]], even if [[virtue]] in general excels height still more, all goods [[good]] will be commensurable; for if a [[certain]] amount is [[better]] than some other, it is clear that some other will be [[equal]]. but since no such comparison can be made, it is evident that there is [[good]] [[reason]] why in [[politics]] [[men]] do not ground their claim to office on every sort of inequality any more than in the [[arts]]. for if some be slow, and others swift, that is no [[reason]] why the one should have little and the others much; it is in gymnastics contests that such excellence is rewarded. whereas the rival claims of candidates for office can only be based on the possession of elements which enter into the composition of a [[state]]. and therefore the [[noble]], or free-born, or [[rich]], may with [[good]] [[reason]] claim office; for holders of offices must be freemen and taxpayers: a [[state]] can be no more composed entirely of [[poor]] [[men]] than entirely of slaves [[slave]]. but if [[wealth]] and [[freedom]] are necessary elements, [[justice]] and valor are equally so; for without the former qualities a [[state]] cannot [[exist]] at all, without the latter not well. 

part xiii 

if the existence of the [[state]] is alone to be considered, then it would seem that all, or some at least, of these claims are just; but, if we take into account a [[good]] [[life]], then, as i have already said, [[education]] and [[virtue]] have superior claims. as, however, those who are [[equal]] in one thing ought not to have an [[equal]] share in all, nor those who are unequal in one thing to have an unequal share in all, it is [[certain]] that all forms of [[government]] which rest on either of these principles [[principle]] are perversions. all [[men]] have a claim in a [[certain]] sense, as i have already admitted, but all have not an absolute claim. the [[rich]] claim because they have a greater share in the [[land]], and [[land]] is the [[common]] element of the [[state]]; also they are generally more trustworthy in contracts. the [[free]] claim under the same tide as the [[noble]]; for they are nearly akin. for the [[noble]] are [[citizens]] in a truer sense than the ignoble, and [[good]] birth is always valued in a man's [[man]] own [[home]] and [[country]]. another [[reason]] is, that those who are sprung from [[better]] [[ancestors]] are likely to be [[better]] [[men]], for nobility is excellence of [[race]]. [[virtue]], too, may be truly said to have a claim, for [[justice]] has been acknowledged by us to be a social [[virtue]], and it implies all others. again, the many may urge their claim against the few; for, when taken collectively, and compared with the few, they are stronger and richer and [[better]]. but, what if the [[good]], the [[rich]], the [[noble]], and the other classes who make up a [[state]], are all living together in the same [[city]], will there, or will there not, be any [[doubt]] who shall [[rule]]? no [[doubt]] at all in determining who ought to [[rule]] in each of the above-mentioned forms of [[government]]. for states are characterized by differences in their governing bodies-one of them has a [[government]] of the [[rich]], another of the [[virtuous]], and so on. but a difficulty arises when all these elements co-exist. how are we to decide? suppose the [[virtuous]] to be very few in number: may we consider their numbers in relation to their duties [[duty]], and ask whether they are enough to administer the [[state]], or so many as will make up a [[state]]? objections may be urged against all the aspirants to [[political]] [[power]]. for those who found their claims on [[wealth]] or [[family]] might be [[thought]] to have no basis of [[justice]]; on this [[principle]], if any one [[person]] were richer than all the rest, it is clear that he ought to be ruler of them. in like manner he who is very distinguished by his birth ought to have the superiority over all those who claim on the ground that they are freeborn. in an [[aristocracy]], or [[government]] of the [[best]], a like difficulty occurs about [[virtue]]; for if one citizen be [[better]] than the other members of the [[government]], however [[good]] they may be, he too, upon the same [[principle]] of [[justice]], should [[rule]] over them. and if the [[people]] are to be supreme because they are stronger than the few, then if one [[man]], or more than one, but not a majority, is stronger than the many, they ought to [[rule]], and not the many. 

all these considerations appear to show that none of the principles [[principle]] on which [[men]] claim to [[rule]] and to hold all other [[men]] in subjection to them are strictly [[right]]. to those who claim to be masters of the [[government]] on the ground of their [[virtue]] or their [[wealth]], the many might fairly [[answer]] that they themselves are often [[better]] and richer than the few- i do not say individually, but collectively. and another ingenious objection which is sometimes put forward may be met in a similar manner. some persons [[person]] [[doubt]] whether the legislator who desires [[desire]] to make the justest laws [[law]] ought to legislate with a view to the [[good]] of the higher classes or of the many, when the case which we have mentioned occurs. now what is just or [[right]] is to be interpreted in the sense of 'what is equal'; and that which is [[right]] in the sense of being [[equal]] is to be considered with reference to the advantage of the [[state]], and the [[common]] [[good]] of the [[citizens]]. and a citizen is one who shares in governing and being governed. he differs under different forms of [[government]], but in the [[best]] [[state]] he is one who is able and willing to be governed and to govern with a view to the [[life]] of [[virtue]]. 

if, however, there be some one [[person]], or more than one, although not enough to make up the full complement of a [[state]], whose [[virtue]] is so pre-eminent that the virtues [[virtue]] or the [[political]] capacity of all the rest admit of no comparison with his or theirs, he or they can be no longer regarded as part of a [[state]]; for [[justice]] will not be done to the superior, if he is reckoned only as the [[equal]] of those who are so far inferior to him in [[virtue]] and in [[political]] capacity. such an one may truly be deemed a [[god]] among [[men]]. hence we see that legislation is necessarily concerned only with those who are [[equal]] in birth and in capacity; and that for [[men]] of pre-eminent [[virtue]] there is no law- they are themselves a [[law]]. any would be ridiculous who attempted to make laws [[law]] for them: they would probably retort what, in the fable of antisthenes, the lions said to the hares, when in the council of the beasts the latter began haranguing and claiming equality for all. and for this [[reason]] democratic states have instituted ostracism; equality is above all things their aim, and therefore they ostracized and [[banished]] from the [[city]] for a [[time]] those who seemed to predominate too much through their [[wealth]], or the number of their [[friends]], or through any other [[political]] influence. mythology tells us that the argonauts left heracles behind for a similar [[reason]]; the ship argo would not take him because she feared that he would have been too much for the rest of the crew. wherefore those who denounce [[tyranny]] and blame the counsel which periander gave to thrasybulus cannot be held altogether just in their censure. the story is that periander, when the herald was sent to ask counsel of him, said nothing, but only cut off the tallest ears of corn till he had brought the field to a level. the herald did not [[know]] the meaning of the action, but came and reported what he had seen to thrasybulus, who understood that he was to cut off the principal [[men]] in the [[state]]; and this is a policy not only expedient for tyrants [[tyrant]] or in practice confined to them, but equally necessary in oligarchies and democracies [[democracy]]. ostracism is a measure of the same [[kind]], which acts by disabling and banishing the most prominent [[citizens]]. [[great]] powers [[power]] do the same to whole cities [[city]] and nations, as the athenians did to the samians, chians, and lesbians; no sooner had they obtained a firm grasp of the [[empire]], than they humbled their allies contrary to treaty; and the persian [[king]] has repeatedly crushed the medes, babylonians, and other nations, when their spirit has been stirred by the recollection of their former greatness. 

the problem is a universal one, and equally concerns all forms of [[government]], true as well as false; for, although perverted forms with a view to their own interests may adopt this policy, those which seek the [[common]] interest do so likewise. the same thing may be observed in the [[arts]] and sciences [[science]]; for the painter will not allow the figure to have a foot which, however beautiful, is not in proportion, nor will the shipbuilder allow the stem or any other part of the vessel to be unduly large, any more than the chorus-master will allow any one who sings louder or [[better]] than all the rest to sing in the choir. monarchs, too, may practice compulsion and still [[live]] in harmony with their cities [[city]], if their own [[government]] is for the interest of the [[state]]. hence where there is an acknowledged superiority the argument in favor of ostracism is based upon a [[kind]] of [[political]] [[justice]]. it would certainly be [[better]] that the legislator should from the first so order his [[state]] as to have no need of such a remedy. but if the need arises, the next [[best]] thing is that he should endeavor to [[correct]] the [[evil]] by this or some similar measure. the [[principle]], however, has not been fairly applied in states; for, instead of looking to the [[good]] of their own [[constitution]], they have used ostracism for factious purposes [[purpose]]. it is true that under perverted forms of [[government]], and from their special point of view, such a measure is just and expedient, but it is also clear that it is not absolutely just. in the [[perfect]] [[state]] there would be [[great]] doubts [[doubt]] about the use of it, not when applied to excess in [[strength]], [[wealth]], popularity, or the like, but when used against some one who is pre-eminent in virtue- what is to be done with him? [[mankind]] will not say that such an one is to be expelled and exiled; on the other hand, he ought not to be a subject- that would be as if [[mankind]] should claim to [[rule]] over [[zeus]], dividing his offices among them. the only alternative is that all should joyfully obey such a ruler, according to what seems to be the order of [[nature]], and that [[men]] like him should be kings [[king]] in their [[state]] for [[life]]. 

part xiv 

the preceding discussion, by a [[natural]] transition, leads to the consideration of royalty, which we admit to be one of the true forms of [[government]]. let us see whether in order to be well governed a [[state]] or [[country]] should be under the [[rule]] of a [[king]] or under some other form of [[government]]; and whether [[monarchy]], although [[good]] for some, may not be [[bad]] for others. but first we must determine whether there is one [[species]] of royalty or many. it is easy to see that there are many, and that the manner of [[government]] is not the same in all of them. 

of royalties according to [[law]], (1) the lacedaemonian is [[thought]] to [[answer]] [[best]] to the true pattern; but there the [[royal]] [[power]] is not absolute, except when the kings [[king]] go on an expedition, and then they take the command. matters of [[religion]] are likewise committed to them. the kingly office is in [[truth]] a [[kind]] of generalship, irresponsible and perpetual. the [[king]] has not the [[power]] of [[life]] and [[death]], except in a specified case, as for instance, in ancient times [[time]], he had it when upon a campaign, by [[right]] of [[force]]. this custom is described in [[homer]]. for [[agamemnon]] is patient when he is attacked in the assembly, but when the [[army]] goes out to [[battle]] he has the [[power]] even of [[life]] and [[death]]. does he not say- 'when i find a [[man]] skulking apart from the [[battle]], nothing shall save him from the dogs and vultures, for in my hands is death'? 

this, then, is one form of royalty-a generalship for [[life]]: and of such royalties some are hereditary and others elective. 

(2) there is another sort of [[monarchy]] not uncommon among the barbarians, which nearly resembles [[tyranny]]. but this is both legal and hereditary. for barbarians, being more servile in [[character]] than hellenes, and asiadics than europeans [[european]], do not rebel against a despotic [[government]]. such royalties have the [[nature]] of tyrannies because the [[people]] are by [[nature]] slaves [[slave]]; but there is no danger of their being overthrown, for they are hereditary and legal. wherefore also their guards are such as a [[king]] and not such as a [[tyrant]] would employ, that is to say, they are composed of [[citizens]], whereas the guards of tyrants [[tyrant]] are mercenaries. for kings [[king]] [[rule]] according to [[law]] over voluntary subjects [[subject]], but tyrants [[tyrant]] over involuntary; and the one are guarded by their fellow-citizens the others are guarded against them. 

these are two forms of [[monarchy]], and there was a third (3) which existed in ancient hellas, called an aesymnetia or dictatorship. this may be defined generally as an elective [[tyranny]], which, like the barbarian [[monarchy]], is legal, but differs from it in not being hereditary. sometimes the office was held for [[life]], sometimes for a term of years, or until [[certain]] duties [[duty]] had been performed. for [[example]], the mytilenaeans elected pittacus leader against the exiles, who were headed by antimenides and alcaeus the poet. and alcaeus himself shows in one of his banquet odes that they chose pittacus [[tyrant]], for he reproaches his fellow-citizens for 'having made the low-born pittacus [[tyrant]] of the spiritless and ill-fated [[city]], with one voice shouting his praises [[praise]].' 

these forms of [[government]] have always had the [[character]] of tyrannies, because they possess despotic [[power]]; but inasmuch as they are elective and acquiesced in by their subjects [[subject]], they are kingly. 

(4) there is a fourth [[species]] of kingly rule- that of the heroic times- which was hereditary and legal, and was exercised over willing subjects [[subject]]. for the first chiefs [[chief]] were benefactors of the [[people]] in [[arts]] or arms; they either gathered them into a [[community]], or procured [[land]] for them; and thus they became kings [[king]] of voluntary subjects [[subject]], and their [[power]] was inherited by their descendants. they took the command in [[war]] and presided over the sacrifices [[sacrifice]], except those which required a [[priest]]. they also decided causes either with or without an oath; and when they swore, the form of the oath was the stretching out of their sceptre. in ancient times [[time]] their [[power]] extended continuously to all things whatsoever, in [[city]] and [[country]], as well as in [[foreign]] parts; but at a later date they relinquished several of these privileges [[privilege]], and others the [[people]] took from them, until in some states nothing was left to them but the sacrifices [[sacrifice]]; and where they retained more of the reality they had only the [[right]] of leadership in [[war]] beyond the border. 

these, then, are the four kinds [[kind]] of royalty. first the [[monarchy]] of the heroic ages [[age]]; this was exercised over voluntary subjects [[subject]], but limited to [[certain]] functions; the [[king]] was a general and a [[judge]], and had the control of [[religion]] the second is that of the barbarians, which is a hereditary despotic [[government]] in accordance with [[law]]. a third is the [[power]] of the so-called aesynmete or dictator; this is an elective [[tyranny]]. the fourth is the lacedaemonian, which is in [[fact]] a generalship, hereditary and perpetual. these four forms differ from one another in the manner which i have described. 

(5) there is a fifth form of kingly [[rule]] in which one has the disposal of all, just as each nation or each [[state]] has the disposal of [[public]] matters; this form corresponds to the control of a household. for as household management is the kingly [[rule]] of a house, so kingly [[rule]] is the household management of a [[city]], or of a nation, or of many nations. 

part xv 

of these forms we need only consider two, the lacedaemonian and the absolute royalty; for most of the others he in a region between them, having less [[power]] than the [[last]], and more than the first. thus the inquiry is reduced to two points: first, is it advantageous to the [[state]] that there should be a perpetual general, and if so, should the office be confined to one [[family]], or open to the [[citizens]] in turn? secondly, is it well that a [[single]] [[man]] should have the supreme [[power]] in all things? the first [[question]] falls under the head of laws [[law]] rather than of constitutions [[constitution]]; for perpetual generalship might equally [[exist]] under any form of [[government]], so that this matter may be dismissed for the [[present]]. the other [[kind]] of royalty is a sort of [[constitution]]; this we have now to consider, and briefly to run over the difficulties involved in it. we will begin by inquiring whether it is more advantageous to be ruled by the [[best]] [[man]] or by the [[best]] laws [[law]]. 

the advocates of royalty maintain that the laws [[law]] speak only in general terms, and cannot provide for circumstances; and that for any [[science]] to abide by written rules [[rule]] is absurd. in [[egypt]] the physician is allowed to alter his treatment after the fourth day, but if sooner, he takes the risk. hence it is clear that a [[government]] acting according to written laws [[law]] is plainly not the [[best]]. yet surely the ruler cannot dispense with the general [[principle]] which exists in [[law]]; and this is a [[better]] ruler which is [[free]] from passion than that in which it is innate. whereas the [[law]] is passionless, passion must ever sway the [[heart]] of [[man]]. yes, it may be replied, but then on the other hand an [[individual]] will be [[better]] able to deliberate in particular cases. 

the [[best]] [[man]], then, must legislate, and laws [[law]] must be passed, but these laws [[law]] will have no [[authority]] when they miss the mark, though in all other cases retaining their [[authority]]. but when the [[law]] cannot determine a point at all, or not well, should the one [[best]] [[man]] or should all decide? according to our [[present]] practice assemblies meet, sit in [[judgment]], deliberate, and decide, and their judgments [[judgment]] an relate to [[individual]] cases. now any member of the assembly, taken separately, is certainly inferior to the [[wise]] [[man]]. but the [[state]] is made up of many individuals [[individual]]. and as a feast to which all the guests contribute is [[better]] than a banquet furnished by a [[single]] [[man]], so a multitude is a [[better]] [[judge]] of many things than any [[individual]]. 

again, the many are more incorruptible than the few; they are like the greater quantity of water which is less easily corrupted than a little. the [[individual]] is liable to be overcome by anger or by some other passion, and then his [[judgment]] is necessarily perverted; but it is hardly to be supposed that a [[great]] number of persons [[person]] would all get into a passion and go [[wrong]] at the same moment. let us assume that they are the freemen, and that they never act in violation of the [[law]], but fill up the gaps which the [[law]] is obliged to leave. or, if such [[virtue]] is scarcely attainable by the multitude, we need only suppose that the majority are [[good]] [[men]] and [[good]] [[citizens]], and ask which will be the more incorruptible, the one [[good]] ruler, or the many who are all [[good]]? will not the many? but, you will say, there may be parties among them, whereas the one [[man]] is not divided against himself. to which we may [[answer]] that their [[character]] is as [[good]] as his. if we call the [[rule]] of many [[men]], who are all of them [[good]], [[aristocracy]], and the [[rule]] of one [[man]] royalty, then [[aristocracy]] will be [[better]] for states than royalty, whether the [[government]] is supported by [[force]] or not, provided only that a number of [[men]] [[equal]] in [[virtue]] can be found. 

the first governments [[government]] were kingships, probably for this [[reason]], because of old, when cities [[city]] were small, [[men]] of eminent [[virtue]] were few. further, they were made kings [[king]] because they were benefactors, and benefits can only be bestowed by [[good]] [[men]]. but when many persons [[person]] [[equal]] in [[merit]] arose, no longer enduring the pre-eminence of one, they [[desired]] to have a commonwealth, and set up a [[constitution]]. the ruling class soon deteriorated and enriched themselves out of the [[public]] treasury; riches [[rich]] became the path to [[honor]], and so oligarchies naturally grew up. these passed into tyrannies and tyrannies into democracies [[democracy]]; for [[love]] of gain in the ruling classes was always tending to diminish their number, and so to strengthen the masses, who in the end set upon their masters and established democracies [[democracy]]. since cities [[city]] have increased in size, no other form of [[government]] appears to be any longer even easy to establish. 

even supposing the [[principle]] to be maintained that kingly [[power]] is the [[best]] thing for states, how about the [[family]] of the [[king]]? are his [[children]] to succeed him? if they are no [[better]] than anybody else, that will be mischievous. but, says the lover of royalty, the [[king]], though he might, will not hand on his [[power]] to his [[children]]. that, however, is hardly to be expected, and is too much to ask of [[human]] [[nature]]. there is also a difficulty about the [[force]] which he is to employ; should a [[king]] have guards about him by whose aid he may be able to coerce the refractory? if not, how will he administer his [[kingdom]]? even if he be the lawful [[sovereign]] who does nothing arbitrarily or contrary to [[law]], still he must have some [[force]] wherewith to maintain the [[law]]. in the case of a limited [[monarchy]] there is not much difficulty in answering this [[question]]; the [[king]] must have such [[force]] as will be more than a match for one or more individuals [[individual]], but not so [[great]] as that of the [[people]]. the ancients observe this [[principle]] when they have guards to any one whom they appointed dictator or [[tyrant]]. thus, when dionysius [[asked]] the syracusans to allow him guards, somebody advised that they should give him only such a number. 

part xvi 

at this place in the discussion there impends the inquiry respecting the [[king]] who acts solely according to his own will he has now to be considered. the so-called limited [[monarchy]], or kingship according to [[law]], as i have already remarked, is not a distinct form of [[government]], for under all governments [[government]], as, for [[example]], in a [[democracy]] or [[aristocracy]], there may be a general holding office for [[life]], and one [[person]] is often made supreme over the administration of a [[state]]. a magistracy of this [[kind]] exists at epidamnus, and also at opus, but in the latter [[city]] has a more limited [[power]]. now, absolute [[monarchy]], or the arbitrary [[rule]] of a [[sovereign]] over an the [[citizens]], in a [[city]] which consists of equals [[equal]], is [[thought]] by some to be quite contrary to [[nature]]; it is argued that those who are by [[nature]] equals [[equal]] must have the same [[natural]] [[right]] and worth, and that for unequals to have an [[equal]] share, or for equals [[equal]] to have an uneven share, in the offices of [[state]], is as [[bad]] as for different bodily constitutions [[constitution]] to have the same food and clothing. wherefore it is [[thought]] to be just that among equals [[equal]] every one be ruled as well as [[rule]], and therefore that an should have their turn. we thus arrive at [[law]]; for an order of succession implies [[law]]. and the [[rule]] of the [[law]], it is argued, is preferable to that of any [[individual]]. on the same [[principle]], even if it be [[better]] for [[certain]] individuals [[individual]] to govern, they should be made only guardians and ministers of the [[law]]. for magistrates there must be- this is admitted; but then [[men]] say that to give [[authority]] to any one [[man]] when all are [[equal]] is [[unjust]]. nay, there may indeed be cases which the [[law]] seems unable to determine, but in such cases can a [[man]]? nay, it will be replied, the [[law]] trains officers for this express [[purpose]], and appoints them to determine matters which are left undecided by it, to the [[best]] of their [[judgment]]. further, it permits them to make any amendment of the existing laws [[law]] which [[experience]] suggests. therefore he who bids the [[law]] [[rule]] may be deemed to bid [[god]] and [[reason]] alone [[rule]], but he who bids [[man]] [[rule]] adds an element of the beast; for [[desire]] is a wild beast, and passion perverts the minds [[mind]] of rulers, even when they are the [[best]] of [[men]]. the [[law]] is [[reason]] unaffected by [[desire]]. we are told that a patient should call in a physician; he will not get [[better]] if he is doctored out of a [[book]]. but the parallel of the [[arts]] is clearly not in point; for the physician does nothing contrary to [[rule]] from motives of [[friendship]]; he only cures a patient and takes a fee; whereas magistrates do many things from spite and partiality. and, indeed, if a [[man]] suspected the physician of being in league with his enemies [[enemy]] to [[destroy]] him for a bribe, he would rather have recourse to the [[book]]. but certainly physicians, when they are sick, call in other physicians, and training-masters, when they are in training, other training-masters, as if they could not [[judge]] judge truly about their own case and might be influenced by their feelings. hence it is evident that in seeking for [[justice]] [[men]] seek for the mean or neutral, for the [[law]] is the mean. again, customary laws [[law]] have more weight, and relate to more important matters, than written laws [[law]], and a [[man]] may be a safer ruler than the written [[law]], but not safer than the customary [[law]]. 

again, it is by no means easy for one [[man]] to superintend many things; he will have to appoint a number of subordinates, and what difference does it make whether these subordinates always existed or were appointed by him because he needed theme if, as i said before, the [[good]] [[man]] has a [[right]] to [[rule]] because he is [[better]], still two [[good]] [[men]] are [[better]] than one: this is the old saying, two going together, and the prayer of [[agamemnon]], 

"would that i had ten such councillors! "

and at this day there are magistrates, for [[example]] judges [[judge]], who have [[authority]] to decide some matters which the [[law]] is unable to determine, since no one doubts [[doubt]] that the [[law]] would command and decide in the [[best]] manner whatever it could. but some things can, and other things cannot, be comprehended under the [[law]], and this is the origin of the nexted [[question]] whether the [[best]] [[law]] or the [[best]] [[man]] should [[rule]]. for matters of detail about which [[men]] deliberate cannot be included in legislation. nor does any one deny that the decision of such matters must be left to [[man]], but it is argued that there should be many judges [[judge]], and not one only. for every ruler who has been trained by the [[law]] judges [[judge]] well; and it would surely seem [[strange]] that a [[person]] should see [[better]] with two [[eyes]], or hear [[better]] with two ears, or act [[better]] with two hands or feet, than many with many; indeed, it is already the practice of kings [[king]] to make to themselves many [[eyes]] and ears and hands and feet. for they make colleagues of those who are the [[friends]] of themselves and their governments [[government]]. they must be [[friends]] of the monarch and of his [[government]]; if not his [[friends]], they will not do what he wants; but [[friendship]] implies likeness and equality; and, therefore, if he thinks [[think]] that his [[friends]] ought to [[rule]], he must [[think]] that those who are [[equal]] to himself and like himself ought to [[rule]] equally with himself. these are the principal controversies relating to [[monarchy]]. 

part xvii 

but may not all this be true in some cases and not in others? for there is by [[nature]] both a [[justice]] and an advantage appropriate to the [[rule]] of a master, another to kingly [[rule]], another to constitutional [[rule]]; but there is none naturally appropriate to [[tyranny]], or to any other perverted form of [[government]]; for these come into being contrary to [[nature]]. now, to [[judge]] at least from what has been said, it is manifest that, where [[men]] are alike and [[equal]], it is neither expedient nor just that one [[man]] should be [[lord]] of all, whether there are laws [[law]], or whether there are no laws [[law]], but he himself is in the place of [[law]]. neither should a [[good]] [[man]] be [[lord]] over [[good]] [[men]], nor a [[bad]] [[man]] over [[bad]]; nor, even if he excels in [[virtue]], should he have a [[right]] to [[rule]], unless in a particular case, at which i have already hinted, and to which i will once more recur. but first of all, i must determine what natures [[nature]] are suited for [[government]] by a [[king]], and what for an [[aristocracy]], and what for a constitutional [[government]]. 

a [[people]] who are by [[nature]] capable of producing a [[race]] superior in the [[virtue]] needed for [[political]] [[rule]] are fitted for kingly [[government]]; and a [[people]] submitting to be ruled as freemen by [[men]] whose [[virtue]] renders them capable of [[political]] command are adapted for an [[aristocracy]]; while the [[people]] who are suited for constitutional [[freedom]] are those among whom there naturally exists a warlike multitude able to [[rule]] and to obey in turn by a [[law]] which gives office to the well-to-do according to their desert. but when a whole [[family]] or some [[individual]], happens to be so pre-eminent in [[virtue]] as to surpass all others, then it is just that they should be the [[royal]] [[family]] and supreme over all, or that this one citizen should be [[king]] of the whole nation. for, as i said before, to give them [[authority]] is not only agreeable to that ground of [[right]] which the founders of all states, whether aristocratical, or oligarchical, or again democratical, are accustomed to put forward (for these all recognize the claim of excellence, although not the same excellence), but accords with the [[principle]] already laid down. for surely it would not be [[right]] to kill, or ostracize, or [[exile]] such a [[person]], or require that he should take his turn in being governed. the whole is naturally superior to the part, and he who has this pre-eminence is in the relation of a whole to a part. but if so, the only alternative is that he should have the supreme [[power]], and that [[mankind]] should obey him, not in turn, but always. these are the conclusions at which we arrive respecting royalty and its various forms, and this is the [[answer]] to the [[question]], whether it is or is not advantageous to states, and to which, and how. 

part xviii 

we maintain that the true forms of [[government]] are three, and that the [[best]] must be that which is administered by the [[best]], and in which there is one [[man]], or a whole [[family]], or many persons [[person]], excelling all the others together in [[virtue]], and both rulers and subjects [[subject]] are fitted, the one to [[rule]], the others to be ruled, in such a manner as to attain the most eligible [[life]]. we showed at the commencement of our inquiry that the [[virtue]] of the [[good]] [[man]] is necessarily the same as the [[virtue]] of the citizen of the [[perfect]] [[state]]. clearly then in the same manner, and by the same means through which a [[man]] becomes truly [[good]], he will frame a [[state]] that is to be ruled by an [[aristocracy]] or by a [[king]], and the same [[education]] and the same habits will be found to make a [[good]] [[man]] and a [[man]] fit to be a statesman or a [[king]]. 

having arrived at these conclusions, we must proceed to speak of the [[perfect]] [[state]], and describe how it comes into being and is established.


book four	   go to next

part i 

in all [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] which embrace the whole of any [[subject]], and do not come into being in a fragmentary way, it is the province of a [[single]] art [[arts]] or [[science]] to consider all that appertains to a [[single]] [[subject]]. for [[example]], the art [[arts]] of gymnastic considers not only the suitableness of different modes of training to different bodies [[body]] (2), but what sort is absolutely the [[best]] (1); (for the absolutely [[best]] must suit that which is by [[nature]] [[best]] and [[best]] furnished with the means of life), and also what [[common]] form of training is adapted to the [[great]] majority of [[men]] (4). and if a [[man]] does not [[desire]] the [[best]] habit of [[body]], or the [[greatest]] [[skill]] in gymnastics, which might be attained by him, still the trainer or the teacher of gymnastic should be able to impart any lower [[degree]] of either (3). the same [[principle]] equally holds in medicine and shipbuilding, and the making of clothes, and in the [[arts]] generally. 

hence it is obvious that [[government]] too is the [[subject]] of a [[single]] [[science]], which has to consider what [[government]] is [[best]] and of what sort it must be, to be most in accordance with our aspirations, if there were no external impediment, and also what [[kind]] of [[government]] is adapted to particular states. for the [[best]] is often unattainable, and therefore the true legislator and statesman ought to be acquainted, not only with (1) that which is [[best]] in the abstract, but also with (2) that which is [[best]] relatively to circumstances. we should be able further to say how a [[state]] may be constituted under any given conditions (3); both how it is originally formed and, when formed, how it may be longest preserved; the supposed [[state]] being so far from having the [[best]] [[constitution]] that it is unprovided even with the conditions necessary for the [[best]]; neither is it the [[best]] under the circumstances, but of an inferior type. 

he ought, moreover, to [[know]] (4) the form of [[government]] which is [[best]] suited to states in general; for [[political]] writers, although they have excellent ideas [[idea]], are often unpractical. we should consider, not only what form of [[government]] is [[best]], but also what is possible and what is easily attainable by all. there are some who would have none but the most [[perfect]]; for this many [[natural]] advantages are required. others, again, speak of a more attainable form, and, although they reject the [[constitution]] under which they are living, they extol some one in particular, for [[example]] the lacedaemonian. any [[change]] of [[government]] which has to be introduced should be one which [[men]], starting from their existing constitutions [[constitution]], will be both willing and able to adopt, since there is quite as much trouble in the reformation of an old [[constitution]] as in the establishment of a new one, just as to unlearn is as hard as to learn. and therefore, in addition to the qualifications of the statesman already mentioned, he should be able to find remedies for the defects of existing constitutions [[constitution]], as has been said before. this he cannot do unless he knows [[know]] how many forms of [[government]] there are. it is often supposed that there is only one [[kind]] of [[democracy]] and one of [[oligarchy]]. but this is a mistake; and, in order to avoid such mistakes, we must ascertain what differences there are in the constitutions [[constitution]] of states, and in how many ways they are combined. the same [[political]] insight will enable a [[man]] to [[know]] which laws [[law]] are the [[best]], and which are suited to different constitutions [[constitution]]; for the laws [[law]] are, and ought to be, relative to the [[constitution]], and not the [[constitution]] to the laws [[law]]. a [[constitution]] is the organization of offices in a [[state]], and determines what is to be the governing [[body]], and what is the end of each [[community]]. but laws [[law]] are not to be confounded with the principles [[principle]] of the [[constitution]]; they are the rules [[rule]] according to which the magistrates should administer the [[state]], and proceed against offenders. so that we must [[know]] the varieties, and the number of varieties, of each form of [[government]], if only with a view to making laws [[law]]. for the same laws [[law]] cannot be equally suited to all oligarchies or to all democracies [[democracy]], since there is certainly more than one form both of [[democracy]] and of [[oligarchy]]. 

part ii 

in our original discussion about governments [[government]] we divided them into three true forms: kingly [[rule]], [[aristocracy]], and constitutional [[government]], and three corresponding perversions- [[tyranny]], [[oligarchy]], and [[democracy]]. of kingly [[rule]] and of [[aristocracy]], we have already spoken, for the inquiry into the [[perfect]] [[state]] is the same thing with the discussion of the two forms thus named, since both imply a [[principle]] of [[virtue]] provided with external means. we have already determined in what [[aristocracy]] and kingly [[rule]] differ from one another, and when the latter should be established. in what follows we have to describe the so-called constitutional [[government]], which bears the [[common]] name of all constitutions [[constitution]], and the other forms, [[tyranny]], [[oligarchy]], and [[democracy]]. 

it is obvious which of the three perversions is the worst, and which is the next in badness. that which is the perversion of the first and most [[divine]] is necessarily the worst. and just as a [[royal]] [[rule]], if not a mere name, must [[exist]] by [[virtue]] of some [[great]] personal superiority in the [[king]], so [[tyranny]], which is the worst of governments [[government]], is necessarily the farthest removed from a well-constituted form; [[oligarchy]] is little [[better]], for it is a long way from [[aristocracy]], and [[democracy]] is the most tolerable of the three. 

a writer who preceded me has already made these distinctions, but his point of view is not the same as mine. for he lays down the [[principle]] that when all the constitutions [[constitution]] are [[good]] (the [[oligarchy]] and the rest being virtuous), [[democracy]] is the worst, but the [[best]] when all are [[bad]]. whereas we maintain that they are in any case defective, and that one [[oligarchy]] is not to be accounted [[better]] than another, but only less [[bad]]. 

not to pursue this [[question]] further at [[present]], let us begin by determining (1) how many varieties of [[constitution]] there are (since of [[democracy]] and [[oligarchy]] there are several): (2) what [[constitution]] is the most generally acceptable, and what is eligible in the next [[degree]] after the [[perfect]] [[state]]; and besides this what other there is which is aristocratical and well-constituted, and at the same [[time]] adapted to states in general; (3) of the other forms of [[government]] to whom each is suited. for [[democracy]] may meet the needs of some [[better]] than [[oligarchy]], and conversely. in the next place (4) we have to consider in what manner a [[man]] ought to proceed who desires [[desire]] to establish some one among these various forms, whether of [[democracy]] or of [[oligarchy]]; and lastly, (5) having briefly discussed these subjects [[subject]] to the [[best]] of our [[power]], we will endeavor to ascertain the modes of ruin and preservation both of constitutions [[constitution]] generally and of each separately, and to what causes they are to be attributed. 

part iii 

the [[reason]] why there are many forms of [[government]] is that every [[state]] contains many elements. in the first place we see that all states are made up of families [[family]], and in the multitude of citizen there must be some [[rich]] and some [[poor]], and some in a middle condition; the [[rich]] are heavy-armed, and the [[poor]] not. of the [[common]] [[people]], some are husbandmen, and some traders, and some artisans. there are also among the notables differences of [[wealth]] and property- for [[example]], in the number of horses which they keep, for they cannot afford to keep them unless they are [[rich]]. and therefore in old times [[time]] the cities [[city]] whose [[strength]] lay in their cavalry were oligarchies, and they used cavalry in wars [[war]] against their neighbors; as was the practice of the eretrians and chalcidians, and also of the magnesians on the river maeander, and of other peoples [[people]] in [[asia]]. besides differences of [[wealth]] there are differences of rank and [[merit]], and there are some other elements which were mentioned by us when in treating of [[aristocracy]] we enumerated the essentials of a [[state]]. of these elements, sometimes all, sometimes the lesser and sometimes the greater number, have a share in the [[government]]. it is evident then that there must be many forms of [[government]], differing in [[kind]], since the parts of which they are composed differ from each other in [[kind]]. for a [[constitution]] is an organization of offices, which all the [[citizens]] distribute among themselves, according to the [[power]] which different classes possess, for [[example]] the [[rich]] or the [[poor]], or according to some [[principle]] of equality which includes both. there must therefore be as many forms of [[government]] as there are modes of arranging the offices, according to the superiorities and differences of the parts of the [[state]]. 

there are generally [[thought]] to be two principal forms: as [[men]] say of the winds that there are but two- north and south, and that the rest of them are only variations of these, so of governments [[government]] there are said to be only two forms- [[democracy]] and [[oligarchy]]. for [[aristocracy]] is considered to be a [[kind]] of [[oligarchy]], as being the [[rule]] of a few, and the so-called constitutional [[government]] to be really a [[democracy]], just as among the winds we make the west a variation of the north, and the east of the south wind. similarly of musical modes there are said to be two kinds [[kind]], the dorian and the phrygian; the other arrangements of the scale are comprehended under one or other of these two. about forms of [[government]] this is a very favorite notion. but in either case the [[better]] and more exact way is to distinguish, as i have done, the one or two which are true forms, and to regard the others as perversions, whether of the most perfectly attempered mode or of the [[best]] form of [[government]]: we may compare the severer and more overpowering modes to the oligarchical forms, and the more relaxed and gentler ones to the democratic. 

part iv 

it must not be assumed, as some are fond of saying, that [[democracy]] is simply that form of [[government]] in which the greater number are [[sovereign]], for in oligarchies, and indeed in every [[government]], the majority rules [[rule]]; nor again is [[oligarchy]] that form of [[government]] in which a few are [[sovereign]]. suppose the whole [[population]] of a [[city]] to be 1300, and that of these 1000 are [[rich]], and do not allow the remaining 300 who are [[poor]], but [[free]], and in an other respects [[respect]] their equals [[equal]], a share of the government- no one will say that this is a [[democracy]]. in like manner, if the [[poor]] were few and the masters of the [[rich]] who outnumber them, no one would ever call such a [[government]], in which the [[rich]] majority have no share of office, an [[oligarchy]]. therefore we should rather say that [[democracy]] is the form of [[government]] in which the [[free]] are rulers, and [[oligarchy]] in which the [[rich]]; it is only an accident that the [[free]] are the many and the [[rich]] are the few. otherwise a [[government]] in which the offices were given according to stature, as is said to be the case in ethiopia, or according to [[beauty]], would be an [[oligarchy]]; for the number of tall or good-looking [[men]] is small. and yet [[oligarchy]] and [[democracy]] are not sufficiently distinguished merely by these two characteristics of [[wealth]] and [[freedom]]. both of them contain many other elements, and therefore we must carry our analysis further, and say that the [[government]] is not a [[democracy]] in which the freemen, being few in number, [[rule]] over the many who are not [[free]], as at apollonia, on the ionian gulf, and at thera; (for in each of these states the nobles [[noble]], who were also the earliest settlers, were held in [[chief]] [[honor]], although they were but a few out of many). neither is it a [[democracy]] when the [[rich]] have the [[government]] because they exceed in number; as was the case formerly at colophon, where the bulk of the inhabitants were possessed of large [[property]] before the lydian [[war]]. but the form of [[government]] is a [[democracy]] when the [[free]], who are also [[poor]] and the majority, govern, and an [[oligarchy]] when the [[rich]] and the [[noble]] govern, they being at the same [[time]] few in number. 

i have said that there are many forms of [[government]], and have explained to what causes the variety is due. why there are more than those already mentioned, and what they are, and whence they arise, i will now proceed to consider, starting from the [[principle]] already admitted, which is that every [[state]] consists, not of one, but of many parts. if we were going to speak of the different [[species]] of animals, we should first of all determine the organs which are indispensable to every animal, as for [[example]] some organs of sense and the instruments of receiving and digesting food, such as the mouth and the stomach, besides organs of locomotion. assuming now that there are only so many kinds [[kind]] of organs, but that there may be differences in them- i mean different kinds [[kind]] of mouths, and stomachs, and perceptive and locomotive organs- the possible combinations of these differences will necessarily furnish many variedes of animals. (for animals cannot be the same which have different kinds [[kind]] of mouths or of ears.) and when all the combinations are exhausted, there will be as many sorts of animals as there are combinations of the necessary organs. the same, then, is true of the forms of [[government]] which have been described; states, as i have repeatedly said, are composed, not of one, but of many elements. one element is the food-producing class, who are called husbandmen; a second, the class of mechanics who practice the [[arts]] without which a [[city]] cannot [[exist]]; of these [[arts]] some are absolutely necessary, others contribute to luxury or to the grace of [[life]]. the third class is that of traders, and by traders i mean those who are engaged in buying and selling, whether in commerce or in retail [[trade]]. a fourth class is that of the serfs or laborers. the warriors make up the fifth class, and they are as necessary as any of the others, if the [[country]] is not to be the [[slave]] of every invader. for how can a [[state]] which has any title to the name be of a slavish [[nature]]? the [[state]] is independent and self-sufficing, but a [[slave]] is the reverse of independent. hence we see that this [[subject]], though ingeniously, has not been satisfactorily treated in the [[republic]]. [[socrates]] says that a [[state]] is made up of four sorts of [[people]] who are absolutely necessary; these are a weaver, a husbandman, a shoemaker, and a builder; afterwards, finding that they are not enough, he adds a smith, and again a herdsman, to look after the necessary animals; then a merchant, and then a retail trader. all these together form the complement of the first [[state]], as if a [[state]] were established merely to supply the necessaries of [[life]], rather than for the sake of the [[good]], or stood equally in need of shoemakers and of husbandmen. but he does not admit into the [[state]] a [[military]] class until the [[country]] has increased in size, and is beginning to encroach on its neighbor's [[land]], whereupon they go to [[war]]. yet even amongst his four original [[citizens]], or whatever be the number of those whom he associates in the [[state]], there must be some one who will dispense [[justice]] and determine what is just. and as the [[soul]] may be said to be more truly part of an animal than the [[body]], so the higher parts of states, that is to say, the warrior class, the class engaged in the administration of [[justice]], and that engaged in deliberation, which is the special [[business]] of [[political]] [[common]] sense-these are more essential to the [[state]] than the parts which minister to the necessaries of [[life]]. whether their several functions are the functions of different [[citizens]], or of the same- for it may often happen that the same persons [[person]] are both warriors and husbandmen- is immaterial to the argument. the higher as well as the lower elements are to be equally considered parts of the [[state]], and if so, the [[military]] element at any rate must be included. there are also the wealthy who minister to the [[state]] with their [[property]]; these form the seventh class. the eighth class is that of magistrates and of officers; for the [[state]] cannot [[exist]] without rulers. and therefore some must be able to take office and to serve the [[state]], either always or in turn. there only remains the class of those who deliberate and who [[judge]] between disputants; we were just now distinguishing them. if presence of all these elements, and their [[fair]] and equitable organization, is necessary to states, then there must also be persons [[person]] who have the ability of statesmen. different functions appear to be often combined in the same [[individual]]; for [[example]], the warrior may also be a husbandman, or an artisan; or, again, the councillor a [[judge]]. and all claim to possess [[political]] ability, and [[think]] that they are quite competent to fill most offices. but the same persons [[person]] cannot be [[rich]] and [[poor]] at the same [[time]]. for this [[reason]] the [[rich]] and the [[poor]] are regarded in an especial sense as parts of a [[state]]. again, because the [[rich]] are generally few in number, while the [[poor]] are many, they appear to be antagonistic, and as the one or the other prevails they form the [[government]]. hence arises the [[common]] [[opinion]] that there are two kinds [[kind]] of government- [[democracy]] and [[oligarchy]]. 

i have already explained that there are many forms of [[constitution]], and to what causes the variety is due. let me now show that there are different forms both of [[democracy]] and [[oligarchy]], as will indeed be evident from what has preceded. for both in the [[common]] [[people]] and in the notables various classes are included; of the [[common]] [[people]], one class are husbandmen, another artisans; another traders, who are employed in buying and selling; another are the seafaring class, whether engaged in [[war]] or in [[trade]], as ferrymen or as fishermen. (in many places any one of these classes forms quite a large [[population]]; for [[example]], fishermen at tarentum and byzantium, crews of triremes at [[athens]], merchant seamen at aegina and chios, ferrymen at tenedos.) to the classes already mentioned may be added day-laborers, and those who, owing to their needy circumstances, have no leisure, or those who are not of [[free]] birth on both sides; and there may be other classes as well. the notables again may be divided according to their [[wealth]], birth, [[virtue]], [[education]], and similar differences. 

of forms of [[democracy]] first comes that which is said to be based strictly on equality. in such a [[democracy]] the [[law]] says that it is just for the [[poor]] to have no more advantage than the [[rich]]; and that neither should be masters, but both [[equal]]. for if [[liberty]] and equality, as is [[thought]] by some, are chiefly to be found in [[democracy]], they will be [[best]] attained when all persons [[person]] alike share in the [[government]] to the utmost. and since the [[people]] are the majority, and the [[opinion]] of the majority is decisive, such a [[government]] must necessarily be a [[democracy]]. here then is one sort of [[democracy]]. there is another, in which the magistrates are elected according to a [[certain]] [[property]] qualification, but a low one; he who has the required amount of [[property]] has a share in the [[government]], but he who loses his [[property]] loses his rights [[right]]. another [[kind]] is that in which all the [[citizens]] who are under no disqualification share in the [[government]], but still the [[law]] is supreme. in another, everybody, if he be only a citizen, is admitted to the [[government]], but the [[law]] is supreme as before. a fifth form of [[democracy]], in other respects [[respect]] the same, is that in which, not the [[law]], but the multitude, have the supreme [[power]], and supersede the [[law]] by their decrees. this is a [[state]] of affairs brought about by the demagogues. for in democracies [[democracy]] which are [[subject]] to the [[law]] the [[best]] [[citizens]] hold the first place, and there are no demagogues; but where the laws [[law]] are not supreme, there demagogues spring up. for the [[people]] becomes a monarch, and is many in one; and the many have the [[power]] in their hands, not as individuals [[individual]], but collectively. [[homer]] says that 'it is not [[good]] to have a [[rule]] of many,' but whether he means this corporate [[rule]], or the [[rule]] of many individuals [[individual]], is uncertain. at all events this sort of [[democracy]], which is now a monarch, and no longer under the control of [[law]], seeks to exercise monarchical sway, and grows into a despot; the flatterer is held in [[honor]]; this sort of [[democracy]] being relatively to other democracies [[democracy]] what [[tyranny]] is to other forms of [[monarchy]]. the spirit of both is the same, and they alike exercise a despotic [[rule]] over the [[better]] [[citizens]]. the decrees of the demos correspond to the edicts of the [[tyrant]]; and the demagogue is to the one what the flatterer is to the other. both have [[great]] [[power]]; the flatterer with the [[tyrant]], the demagogue with democracies [[democracy]] of the [[kind]] which we are describing. the demagogues make the decrees of the [[people]] override the laws [[law]], by referring all things to the popular assembly. and therefore they grow [[great]], because the [[people]] have an things in their hands, and they hold in their hands the votes of the [[people]], who are too ready to listen to them. further, those who have any complaint to bring against the magistrates say, 'let the [[people]] be judges'; the [[people]] are too [[happy]] to accept the invitation; and so the [[authority]] of every office is undermined. such a [[democracy]] is fairly open to the objection that it is not a [[constitution]] at all; for where the laws [[law]] have no [[authority]], there is no [[constitution]]. the [[law]] ought to be supreme over all, and the magistracies should [[judge]] of particulars, and only this should be considered a [[constitution]]. so that if [[democracy]] be a real form of [[government]], the sort of [[system]] in which all things are regulated by decrees is clearly not even a [[democracy]] in the true sense of the word, for decrees relate only to particulars. 

these then are the different kinds [[kind]] of [[democracy]]. 

part v 

of oligarchies, too, there are different kinds [[kind]]: one where the [[property]] qualification for office is such that the [[poor]], although they form the majority, have no share in the [[government]], yet he who acquires a qualification may obtain a share. another sort is when there is a qualification for office, but a high one, and the vacancies in the governing [[body]] are fired by co-optation. if the election is made out of all the qualified persons [[person]], a [[constitution]] of this [[kind]] inclines to an [[aristocracy]], if out of a privileged class, to an [[oligarchy]]. another sort of [[oligarchy]] is when the [[son]] succeeds the [[father]]. there is a fourth form, likewise hereditary, in which the magistrates are supreme and not the [[law]]. among oligarchies this is what [[tyranny]] is among monarchies [[monarchy]], and the last-mentioned form of [[democracy]] among democracies [[democracy]]; and in [[fact]] this sort of [[oligarchy]] receives the name of a dynasty (or [[rule]] of powerful families). 

these are the different sorts of oligarchies and democracies [[democracy]]. it should, however, be remembered that in many states the [[constitution]] which is established by [[law]], although not democratic, owing to the [[education]] and habits of the [[people]] may be administered democratically, and conversely in other states the established [[constitution]] may incline to [[democracy]], but may be administered in an oligarchical spirit. this most often happens after a [[revolution]]: for governments [[government]] do not [[change]] at once; at first the dominant party are content with encroaching a little upon their opponents. the laws [[law]] which existed previously continue in [[force]], but the authors of the [[revolution]] have the [[power]] in their hands. 

part vi 

from what has been already said we may safely infer that there are so many different kinds [[kind]] of democracies [[democracy]] and of oligarchies. for it is evident that either all the classes whom we mentioned must share in the [[government]], or some only and not others. when the class of husbandmen and of those who possess moderate fortunes [[fortune]] have the supreme [[power]], the [[government]] is administered according to [[law]]. for the [[citizens]] being compelled to [[live]] by their labor have no leisure; and so they set up the [[authority]] of the [[law]], and attend assemblies only when necessary. they all obtain a share in the [[government]] when they have acquired the qualification which is fixed by the law- the absolute exclusion of any class would be a step towards [[oligarchy]]; hence all who have acquired the [[property]] qualification are admitted to a share in the [[constitution]]. but leisure cannot be provided for them unless there are revenues [[revenue]] to support them. this is one sort of [[democracy]], and these are the causes which give birth to it. another [[kind]] is based on the distinction which naturally comes next in order; in this, every one to whose birth there is no objection is eligible, but actually shares in the [[government]] only if he can find leisure. hence in such a [[democracy]] the supreme [[power]] is vested in the laws [[law]], because the [[state]] has no means of paying the [[citizens]]. a third [[kind]] is when all freemen have a [[right]] to share in the [[government]], but do not actually share, for the [[reason]] which has been already given; so that in this form again the [[law]] must [[rule]]. a fourth [[kind]] of [[democracy]] is that which comes latest in the [[history]] of states. in our own day, when cities [[city]] have far outgrown their original size, and their revenues [[revenue]] have increased, all the [[citizens]] have a place in the [[government]], through the [[great]] preponderance of the multitude; and they all, including the [[poor]] who receive [[pay]], and therefore have leisure to exercise their rights [[right]], share in the administration. indeed, when they are paid, the [[common]] [[people]] have the most leisure, for they are not hindered by the [[care]] of their [[property]], which often fetters the [[rich]], who are thereby prevented from taking part in the assembly or in the courts, and so the [[state]] is governed by the [[poor]], who are a majority, and not by the laws [[law]]. 

so many kinds [[kind]] of democracies [[democracy]] there are, and they grow out of these necessary causes. 

of oligarchies, one form is that in which the majority of the [[citizens]] have some [[property]], but not very much; and this is the first form, which allows to any one who obtains the required amount the [[right]] of sharing in the [[government]]. the sharers in the [[government]] being a numerous [[body]], it follows that the [[law]] must govern, and not individuals [[individual]]. for in proportion as they are further removed from a monarchical form of [[government]], and in [[respect]] of [[property]] have neither so much as to be able to [[live]] without attending to [[business]], nor so little as to need [[state]] support, they must admit the [[rule]] of [[law]] and not claim to [[rule]] themselves. but if the [[men]] of [[property]] in the [[state]] are fewer than in the former case, and own more [[property]], there arises a second form of [[oligarchy]]. for the stronger they are, the more [[power]] they claim, and having this object in view, they themselves select those of the other classes who are to be admitted to the [[government]]; but, not being as yet [[strong]] enough to [[rule]] without the [[law]], they make the [[law]] represent their wishes [[wish]]. when this [[power]] is intensified by a further diminution of their numbers and increase of their [[property]], there arises a third and further stage of [[oligarchy]], in which the governing class keep the offices in their own hands, and the [[law]] ordains that the [[son]] shall succeed the [[father]]. when, again, the rulers have [[great]] [[wealth]] and numerous [[friends]], this sort of [[family]] despotism approaches a [[monarchy]]; individuals [[individual]] [[rule]] and not the [[law]]. this is the fourth sort of [[oligarchy]], and is analogous to the [[last]] sort of [[democracy]]. 

part vii 

there are still two forms besides [[democracy]] and [[oligarchy]]; one of them is universally recognized and included among the four principal forms of [[government]], which are said to be (1) [[monarchy]], (2) [[oligarchy]], (3) [[democracy]], and (4) the so-called [[aristocracy]] or [[government]] of the [[best]]. but there is also a fifth, which retains the generic name of polity or constitutional [[government]]; this is not [[common]], and therefore has not been noticed by writers who attempt to enumerate the different kinds [[kind]] of [[government]]; like [[plato]], in their books [[book]] about the [[state]], they recognize four only. the term 'aristocracy' is rightly applied to the form of [[government]] which is described in the first part of our treatise; for that only can be rightly called [[aristocracy]] which is a [[government]] formed of the [[best]] [[men]] absolutely, and not merely of [[men]] who are [[good]] when tried by any given standard. in the [[perfect]] [[state]] the [[good]] [[man]] is absolutely the same as the [[good]] citizen; whereas in other states the [[good]] citizen is only [[good]] relatively to his own form of [[government]]. but there are some states differing from oligarchies and also differing from the so-called polity or constitutional [[government]]; these are termed aristocracies, and in them the magistrates are certainly chosen, both according to their [[wealth]] and according to their [[merit]]. such a form of [[government]] differs from each of the two just now mentioned, and is termed an [[aristocracy]]. for indeed in states which do not make [[virtue]] the aim of the [[community]], [[men]] of [[merit]] and [[reputation]] for [[virtue]] may be found. and so where a [[government]] has regard to [[wealth]], [[virtue]], and numbers, as at [[carthage]], that is [[aristocracy]]; and also where it has regard only to two out of the three, as at lacedaemon, to [[virtue]] and numbers, and the two principles [[principle]] of [[democracy]] and [[virtue]] temper each other. there are these two forms of [[aristocracy]] in addition to the first and [[perfect]] [[state]], and there is a third form, viz., the constitutions [[constitution]] which incline more than the so-called polity towards [[oligarchy]]. 

part viii 

i have yet to speak of the so-called polity and of [[tyranny]]. i put them in this order, not because a polity or constitutional [[government]] is to be regarded as a perversion any more than the above mentioned aristocracies. the [[truth]] is, that they an fall short of the most [[perfect]] form of [[government]], and so they are reckoned among perversions, and the really perverted forms are perversions of these, as i said in the original discussion. [[last]] of all i will speak of [[tyranny]], which i place [[last]] in the series because i am inquiring into the constitutions [[constitution]] of states, and this is the very reverse of a [[constitution]] 

having explained why i have adopted this order, i will proceed to consider constitutional [[government]]; of which the [[nature]] will be clearer now that [[oligarchy]] and [[democracy]] have been defined. for polity or constitutional [[government]] may be described generally as a fusion of [[oligarchy]] and [[democracy]]; but the term is usually applied to those forms of [[government]] which incline towards [[democracy]], and the term [[aristocracy]] to those which incline towards [[oligarchy]], because birth and [[education]] are commonly the accompaniments of [[wealth]]. moreover, the [[rich]] already possess the external advantages the want of which is a temptation to crime, and hence they are called noblemen and gentlemen. and inasmuch as [[aristocracy]] seeks to give predominance to the [[best]] of the [[citizens]], [[people]] say also of oligarchies that they are composed of noblemen and gentlemen. now it appears to be an impossible thing that the [[state]] which is governed not by the [[best]] [[citizens]] but by the worst should be well-governed, and equally impossible that the [[state]] which is ill-governed should be governed by the [[best]]. but we must [[remember]] that [[good]] laws [[law]], if they are not obeyed, do not constitute [[good]] [[government]]. hence there are two parts of [[good]] [[government]]; one is the actual [[obedience]] of [[citizens]] to the laws [[law]], the other part is the goodness of the laws [[law]] which they obey; they may obey [[bad]] laws [[law]] as well as [[good]]. and there may be a further subdivision; they may obey either the [[best]] laws [[law]] which are attainable to them, or the [[best]] absolutely. 

the distribution of offices according to [[merit]] is a special characteristic of [[aristocracy]], for the [[principle]] of an [[aristocracy]] is [[virtue]], as [[wealth]] is of an [[oligarchy]], and [[freedom]] of a [[democracy]]. in all of them there of course exists the [[right]] of the majority, and whatever seems [[good]] to the majority of those who share in the [[government]] has [[authority]]. now in most states the form called polity exists, for the fusion goes no further than the attempt to unite the [[freedom]] of the [[poor]] and the [[wealth]] of the [[rich]], who commonly take the place of the [[noble]]. but as there are three grounds on which [[men]] claim an [[equal]] share in the [[government]], [[freedom]], [[wealth]], and [[virtue]] (for the fourth or [[good]] birth is the result of the two [[last]], being only ancient [[wealth]] and virtue), it is clear that the admixture of the two elements, that is to say, of the [[rich]] and [[poor]], is to be called a polity or constitutional [[government]]; and the union of the three is to be called [[aristocracy]] or the [[government]] of the [[best]], and more than any other form of [[government]], except the true and ideal, has a [[right]] to this name. 

thus far i have shown the existence of forms of states other than [[monarchy]], [[democracy]], and [[oligarchy]], and what they are, and in what aristocracies differ from one another, and polities from aristocracies- that the two latter are not very unlike is obvious. 

part ix 

next we have to consider how by the side of [[oligarchy]] and [[democracy]] the so-called polity or constitutional [[government]] springs up, and how it should be organized. the [[nature]] of it will be at once understood from a comparison of [[oligarchy]] and [[democracy]]; we must ascertain their different characteristics, and taking a portion from each, put the two together, like the parts of an indenture. now there are three modes in which fusions of [[government]] may be affected. in the first mode we must combine the laws [[law]] made by both governments [[government]], say concerning the administration of [[justice]]. in oligarchies they impose a fine on the [[rich]] if they do not serve as judges [[judge]], and to the [[poor]] they give no [[pay]]; but in democracies [[democracy]] they give [[pay]] to the [[poor]] and do not fine the [[rich]]. now (1) the union of these two modes is a [[common]] or middle term between them, and is therefore characteristic of a constitutional [[government]], for it is a combination of both. this is one mode of uniting the two elements. or (2) a mean may be taken between the enactments of the two: thus democracies [[democracy]] require no [[property]] qualification, or only a small one, from members of the assembly, oligarchies a high one; here neither of these is the [[common]] term, but a mean between them. (3) there is a third mode, in which something is borrowed from the oligarchical and something from the democratical [[principle]]. for [[example]], the appointment of magistrates by lot is [[thought]] to be democratical, and the election of them oligarchical; democratical again when there is no [[property]] qualification, oligarchical when there is. in the aristocratical or constitutional [[state]], one element will be taken from each- from [[oligarchy]] the [[principle]] of electing to offices, from [[democracy]] the disregard of qualification. such are the various modes of combination. 

there is a true union of [[oligarchy]] and [[democracy]] when the same [[state]] may be termed either a [[democracy]] or an [[oligarchy]]; those who use both names evidently [[feel]] that the fusion is complete. such a fusion there is also in the mean; for both extremes appear in it. the lacedaemonian [[constitution]], for [[example]], is often described as a [[democracy]], because it has many democratical features. in the first place the [[youth]] receive a democratical [[education]]. for the sons [[son]] of the [[poor]] are brought up with with the sons [[son]] of the [[rich]], who are educated in such a manner as to make it possible for the sons [[son]] of the [[poor]] to be educated by them. a similar equality prevails in the following period of [[life]], and when the [[citizens]] are grown up to manhood the same [[rule]] is observed; there is no distinction between the [[rich]] and [[poor]]. in like manner they all have the same food at their [[public]] tables, and the [[rich]] wear only such clothing as any [[poor]] [[man]] can afford. again, the [[people]] elect to one of the two [[greatest]] offices of [[state]], and in the other they share; for they elect the senators and share in the ephoralty. by others the spartan [[constitution]] is said to be an [[oligarchy]], because it has many oligarchical elements. that all offices are filled by election and none by lot, is one of these oligarchical characteristics; that the [[power]] of inflicting [[death]] or [[banishment]] rests with a few persons [[person]] is another; and there are others. in a well attempted polity there should appear to be both elements and yet neither; also the [[government]] should rely on itself, and not on [[foreign]] aid, and on itself not through the [[good]] will of a majority- they might be equally well-disposed when there is a vicious form of government- but through the general willingness of all classes in the [[state]] to maintain the [[constitution]]. 

enough of the manner in which a constitutional [[government]], and in which the so-called aristocracies ought to be framed. 

part x 

of the [[nature]] of [[tyranny]] i have still to speak, in order that it may have its place in our inquiry (since even [[tyranny]] is reckoned by us to be a form of government), although there is not much to be said about it. i have already in the former part of this treatise discussed royalty or kingship according to the most usual meaning of the term, and considered whether it is or is not advantageous to states, and what [[kind]] of royalty should be established, and from what source, and how. 

when speaking of royalty we also spoke of two forms of [[tyranny]], which are both according to [[law]], and therefore easily pass into royalty. among barbarians there are elected monarchs who exercise a despotic [[power]]; despotic rulers were also elected in ancient hellas, called aesymnetes or dictators. these monarchies [[monarchy]], when compared with one another, exhibit [[certain]] differences. and they are, as i said before, [[royal]], in so far as the monarch rules [[rule]] according to [[law]] over willing subjects [[subject]]; but they are [[tyrannical]] in so far as he is despotic and rules [[rule]] according to his own fancy. there is also a third [[kind]] of [[tyranny]], which is the most typical form, and is the counterpart of the [[perfect]] [[monarchy]]. this [[tyranny]] is just that arbitrary [[power]] of an [[individual]] which is responsible to no one, and governs all alike, whether equals [[equal]] or [[better]], with a view to its own advantage, not to that of its subjects [[subject]], and therefore against their will. no freeman, if he can escape from it, will endure such a [[government]]. 

the kinds [[kind]] of [[tyranny]] are such and so many, and for the reasons [[reason]] which i have given. 

part xi 

we have now to inquire what is the [[best]] [[constitution]] for most states, and the [[best]] [[life]] for most [[men]], neither assuming a standard of [[virtue]] which is above ordinary persons [[person]], nor an [[education]] which is exceptionally favored by [[nature]] and circumstances, nor yet an ideal [[state]] which is an aspiration only, but having regard to the [[life]] in which the majority are able to share, and to the form of [[government]] which states in general can attain. as to those aristocracies, as they are called, of which we were just now speaking, they either [[lie]] beyond the possibilities of the greater number of states, or they approximate to the so-called constitutional [[government]], and therefore need no separate discussion. and in [[fact]] the conclusion at which we arrive respecting all these forms rests upon the same grounds. for if what was said in the ethics is true, that the [[happy]] [[life]] is the [[life]] according to [[virtue]] lived without impediment, and that [[virtue]] is a mean, then the [[life]] which is in a mean, and in a mean attainable by every one, must be the [[best]]. and the same the same principles [[principle]] of [[virtue]] and [[vice]] are characteristic of cities [[city]] and of constitutions [[constitution]]; for the [[constitution]] is in a figure the [[life]] of the [[city]]. 

now in all states there are three elements: one class is very [[rich]], another very [[poor]], and a third in a mean. it is admitted that moderation and the mean are [[best]], and therefore it will clearly be [[best]] to possess the gifts of [[fortune]] in moderation; for in that condition of [[life]] [[men]] are most ready to [[follow]] [[rational]] [[principle]]. but he who greatly excels in [[beauty]], [[strength]], birth, or [[wealth]], or on the other hand who is very [[poor]], or very [[weak]], or very much disgraced, finds it difficult to [[follow]] [[rational]] [[principle]]. of these two the one sort grow into [[violent]] and [[great]] criminals [[criminal]], the others into rogues and petty rascals. and two sorts of offenses correspond to them, the one committed from [[violence]], the other from roguery. again, the middle class is least likely to shrink from [[rule]], or to be over-ambitious for it; both of which are injuries to the [[state]]. again, those who have too much of the goods [[good]] of [[fortune]], [[strength]], [[wealth]], [[friends]], and the like, are neither willing nor able to submit to [[authority]]. the [[evil]] begins at [[home]]; for when they are boys, by [[reason]] of the luxury in which they are brought up, they never learn, even at school, the habit of [[obedience]]. on the other hand, the very [[poor]], who are in the opposite extreme, are too degraded. so that the one class cannot obey, and can only [[rule]] despotically; the other knows [[know]] not how to command and must be ruled like slaves [[slave]]. thus arises a [[city]], not of freemen, but of masters and slaves [[slave]], the one despising, the other envying; and nothing can be more fatal to [[friendship]] and [[good]] fellowship in states than this: for [[good]] fellowship springs from [[friendship]]; when [[men]] are at enmity with one another, they would rather not even share the same path. but a [[city]] ought to be composed, as far as possible, of equals [[equal]] and similars; and these are generally the middle classes. wherefore the [[city]] which is composed of middle-class [[citizens]] is necessarily [[best]] constituted in [[respect]] of the elements of which we say the fabric of the [[state]] naturally consists. and this is the class of [[citizens]] which is most secure in a [[state]], for they do not, like the [[poor]], covet their neighbors' goods [[good]]; nor do others covet theirs, as the [[poor]] covet the goods [[good]] of the [[rich]]; and as they neither plot against others, nor are themselves plotted against, they pass through [[life]] safely. wisely then did phocylides pray- 'many things are [[best]] in the mean; i [[desire]] to be of a middle condition in my [[city]].' 

thus it is manifest that the [[best]] [[political]] [[community]] is formed by [[citizens]] of the middle class, and that those states are likely to be well-administered in which the middle class is large, and stronger if possible than both the other classes, or at any rate than either singly; for the addition of the middle class turns the scale, and prevents either of the extremes from being dominant. [[great]] then is the [[good]] [[fortune]] of a [[state]] in which the [[citizens]] have a moderate and sufficient [[property]]; for where some possess much, and the others nothing, there may arise an extreme [[democracy]], or a pure [[oligarchy]]; or a [[tyranny]] may grow out of either extreme- either out of the most rampant [[democracy]], or out of an [[oligarchy]]; but it is not so likely to arise out of the middle constitutions [[constitution]] and those akin to them. i will explain the [[reason]] of this hereafter, when i speak of the revolutions [[revolution]] of states. the mean condition of states is clearly [[best]], for no other is [[free]] from faction; and where the middle class is large, there are least likely to be factions and dissensions. for a similar [[reason]] large states are less liable to faction than small ones, because in them the middle class is large; whereas in small states it is easy to divide all the [[citizens]] into two classes who are either [[rich]] or [[poor]], and to leave nothing in the middle. and democracies [[democracy]] are safer and more permanent than oligarchies, because they have a middle class which is more numerous and has a greater share in the [[government]]; for when there is no middle class, and the [[poor]] greatly exceed in number, troubles arise, and the [[state]] soon comes to an end. a proof of the superiority of the middle dass is that the [[best]] legislators have been of a middle condition; for [[example]], solon, as his own verses testify; and lycurgus, for he was not a [[king]]; and charondas, and almost all legislators. 

these considerations will [[help]] us to [[understand]] why most governments [[government]] are either democratical or oligarchical. the [[reason]] is that the middle class is seldom numerous in them, and whichever party, whether the [[rich]] or the [[common]] [[people]], transgresses the mean and predominates, draws the [[constitution]] its own way, and thus arises either [[oligarchy]] or [[democracy]]. there is another reason- the [[poor]] and the [[rich]] quarrel with one another, and whichever side gets the [[better]], instead of establishing a just or popular [[government]], regards [[political]] [[supremacy]] as the prize of [[victory]], and the one party sets up a [[democracy]] and the other an [[oligarchy]]. further, both the parties which had the [[supremacy]] in hellas looked only to the interest of their own form of [[government]], and established in states, the one, democracies [[democracy]], and the other, oligarchies; they [[thought]] of their own advantage, of the [[public]] not at all. for these reasons [[reason]] the middle form of [[government]] has rarely, if ever, existed, and among a very few only. one [[man]] alone of all who ever ruled in hellas was induced to give this middle [[constitution]] to states. but it has now become a habit among the [[citizens]] of states, not even to [[care]] about equality; all [[men]] are seeking for dominion, or, if conquered, are willing to submit. 

what then is the [[best]] form of [[government]], and what makes it the [[best]], is evident; and of other constitutions [[constitution]], since we say that there are many kinds [[kind]] of [[democracy]] and many of [[oligarchy]], it is not difficult to see which has the first and which the second or any other place in the order of excellence, now that we have determined which is the [[best]]. for that which is nearest to the [[best]] must of necessity be [[better]], and that which is furthest from it worse, if we are judging absolutely and not relatively to given conditions: i say 'relatively to given conditions,' since a particular [[government]] may be preferable, but another form may be [[better]] for some [[people]]. 

part xii 

we have now to consider what and what [[kind]] of [[government]] is suitable to what and what [[kind]] of [[men]]. i may begin by assuming, as a general [[principle]] [[common]] to all governments [[government]], that the portion of the [[state]] which desires [[desire]] the permanence of the [[constitution]] ought to be stronger than that which desires [[desire]] the reverse. now every [[city]] is composed of quality and quantity. by quality i mean [[freedom]], [[wealth]], [[education]], [[good]] birth, and by quantity, superiority of numbers. quality may [[exist]] in one of the classes which make up the [[state]], and quantity in the other. for [[example]], the meanly-born may be more in number than the well-born, or the [[poor]] than the [[rich]], yet they may not so much exceed in quantity as they fall short in quality; and therefore there must be a comparison of quantity and quality. where the number of the [[poor]] is more than proportioned to the [[wealth]] of the [[rich]], there will naturally be a [[democracy]], varying in form with the sort of [[people]] who compose it in each case. if, for [[example]], the husbandmen exceed in number, the first form of [[democracy]] will then arise; if the artisans and laboring class, the [[last]]; and so with the intermediate forms. but where the [[rich]] and the notables exceed in quality more than they fall short in quantity, there [[oligarchy]] arises, similarly assuming various forms according to the [[kind]] of superiority possessed by the oligarchs. 

the legislator should always include the middle class in his [[government]]; if he makes his laws [[law]] oligarchical, to the middle class let him look; if he makes them democratical, he should equally by his laws [[law]] try to attach this class to the [[state]]. there only can the [[government]] ever be stable where the middle class exceeds one or both of the others, and in that case there will be no [[fear]] that the [[rich]] will unite with the [[poor]] against the rulers. for neither of them will ever be willing to serve the other, and if they look for some form of [[government]] more suitable to both, they will find none [[better]] than this, for the [[rich]] and the [[poor]] will never [[consent]] to [[rule]] in turn, because they mistrust one another. the arbiter is always the one trusted, and he who is in the middle is an arbiter. the more [[perfect]] the admixture of the [[political]] elements, the more lasting will be the [[constitution]]. many even of those who [[desire]] to form aristocratical governments [[government]] make a mistake, not only in giving too much [[power]] to the [[rich]], but in attempting to overreach the [[people]]. there comes a [[time]] when out of a false [[good]] there arises a true [[evil]], since the encroachments of the [[rich]] are more destructive to the [[constitution]] than those of the [[people]]. 

part xiii 

the devices by which oligarchies [[deceive]] the [[people]] are five in number; they relate to (1) the assembly; (2) the magistracies; (3) the courts of [[law]]; (4) the use of arms; (5) gymnastic exercises. (1) the assemblies are thrown open to all, but either the [[rich]] only are fined for non-attendance, or a much larger fine is inflicted upon them. (2) to the magistracies, those who are qualified by [[property]] cannot decline office upon oath, but the [[poor]] may. (3) in the [[law]] courts the [[rich]], and the [[rich]] only, are fined if they do not serve, the [[poor]] are let off with impunity, or, as in the laws [[law]] of charondas, a larger fine is inflicted on the [[rich]], and a smaller one on the [[poor]]. in some states all citizen who have registered themselves are allowed to attend the assembly and to try causes; but if after registration they do not attend either in the assembly or at the courts, heavy fines are imposed upon them. the intention is that through [[fear]] of the fines they may avoid registering themselves, and then they cannot sit in the law-courts or in the assembly. concerning (4) the possession of arms, and (5) gymnastic exercises, they legislate in a similar spirit. for the [[poor]] are not obliged to have arms, but the [[rich]] are fined for not having them; and in like manner no penalty is inflicted on the [[poor]] for non-attendance at the gymnasium, and consequently, having nothing to [[fear]], they do not attend, whereas the [[rich]] are liable to a fine, and therefore they take [[care]] to attend. 

these are the devices of oligarchical legislators, and in democracies [[democracy]] they have counter devices. they [[pay]] the [[poor]] for attending the assemblies and the law-courts, and they inflict no penalty on the [[rich]] for non-attendance. it is obvious that he who would duly mix the two principles [[principle]] should combine the practice of both, and provide that the [[poor]] should be paid to attend, and the [[rich]] fined if they do not attend, for then all will take part; if there is no such combination, [[power]] will be in the hands of one party only. the [[government]] should be confined to those who carry arms. as to the [[property]] qualification, no absolute [[rule]] can be laid down, but we must see what is the highest qualification sufficiently comprehensive to secure that the number of those who have the rights [[right]] of [[citizens]] exceeds the number of those excluded. even if they have no share in office, the [[poor]], provided only that they are not outraged or deprived of their [[property]], will be quiet enough. 

but to secure gentle treatment for the [[poor]] is not an easy thing, since a ruling class is not always humane. and in [[time]] of [[war]] the [[poor]] are apt to hesitate unless they are fed; when fed, they are willing enough to [[fight]]. in some states the [[government]] is vested, not only in those who are actually serving, but also in those who have served; among the malians, for [[example]], the governing [[body]] consisted of the latter, while the magistrates were chosen from those actually on service. and the earliest [[government]] which existed among the hellenes, after the overthrow of the kingly [[power]], grew up out of the warrior class, and was originally taken from the knights (for [[strength]] and superiority in [[war]] at that [[time]] depended on cavalry; indeed, without discipline, infantry are useless, and in ancient times [[time]] there was no [[military]] [[knowledge]] or tactics, and therefore the [[strength]] of armies [[army]] lay in their cavalry). but when cities [[city]] increased and the heavy armed grew in [[strength]], more had a share in the [[government]]; and this is the [[reason]] why the states which we call constitutional governments [[government]] have been hitherto called democracies [[democracy]]. ancient constitutions [[constitution]], as might be expected, were oligarchical and [[royal]]; their [[population]] being small they had no considerable middle class; the [[people]] were [[weak]] in numbers and organization, and were therefore more contented to be governed. 

i have explained why there are various forms of [[government]], and why there are more than is generally supposed; for [[democracy]], as well as other constitutions [[constitution]], has more than one form: also what their differences are, and whence they arise, and what is the [[best]] form of [[government]], speaking generally and to whom the various forms of [[government]] are [[best]] suited; all this has now been explained. 

part xiv 

having thus gained an appropriate basis of discussion, we will proceed to speak of the points which [[follow]] next in order. we will consider the [[subject]] not only in general but with reference to particular constitutions [[constitution]]. all constitutions [[constitution]] have three elements, concerning which the [[good]] lawgiver has to regard what is expedient for each [[constitution]]. when they are well-ordered, the [[constitution]] is well-ordered, and as they differ from one another, constitutions [[constitution]] differ. there is (1) one element which deliberates about [[public]] affairs; secondly (2) that concerned with the magistrates- the [[question]] being, what they should be, over what they should exercise [[authority]], and what should be the mode of electing to them; and thirdly (3) that which has judicial [[power]]. 

the deliberative element has [[authority]] in matters of [[war]] and [[peace]], in making and unmaking alliances; it passes laws [[law]], inflicts [[death]], [[exile]], confiscation, elects magistrates and audits their accounts. these powers [[power]] must be assigned either all to all the [[citizens]] or an to some of them (for [[example]], to one or more magistracies, or different causes to different magistracies), or some of them to all, and others of them only to some. that all things should be decided by all is characteristic of [[democracy]]; this is the sort of equality which the [[people]] [[desire]]. but there are various ways in which all may share in the [[government]]; they may deliberate, not all in one [[body]], but by turns, as in the [[constitution]] of telecles the milesian. there are other constitutions [[constitution]] in which the boards of magistrates meet and deliberate, but come into office by turns, and are elected out of the tribes and the very smallest divisions of the [[state]], until every one has obtained office in his turn. the [[citizens]], on the other hand, are assembled only for the purposes [[purpose]] of legislation, and to consult about the [[constitution]], and to hear the edicts of the magistrates. in another variety of [[democracy]] the citizen form one assembly, but meet only to elect magistrates, to pass laws [[law]], to advise about [[war]] and [[peace]], and to make scrutinies. other matters are referred severally to special magistrates, who are elected by vote or by lot out of all the [[citizens]] or again, the [[citizens]] meet about election to offices and about scrutinies, and deliberate concerning [[war]] or alliances while other matters are administered by the magistrates, who, as far as is possible, are elected by vote. i am speaking of those magistracies in which special [[knowledge]] is required. a fourth form of [[democracy]] is when all the [[citizens]] meet to deliberate about everything, and the magistrates decide nothing, but only make the preliminary inquiries; and that is the way in which the [[last]] and worst form of [[democracy]], corresponding, as we maintain, to the close [[family]] [[oligarchy]] and to [[tyranny]], is at [[present]] administered. all these modes are democratical. 

on the other hand, that some should deliberate about all is oligarchical. this again is a mode which, like the democratical has many forms. when the deliberative class being elected out of those who have a moderate qualification are numerous and they [[respect]] and obey the prohibitions of the [[law]] without altering it, and any one who has the required qualification shares in the [[government]], then, just because of this moderation, the [[oligarchy]] inclines towards polity. but when only selected individuals [[individual]] and not the whole [[people]] share in the deliberations of the [[state]], then, although, as in the former case, they observe the [[law]], the [[government]] is a pure [[oligarchy]]. or, again, when those who have the [[power]] of deliberation are self-elected, and [[son]] succeeds [[father]], and they and not the laws [[law]] are supreme- the [[government]] is of necessity oligarchical. where, again, particular persons [[person]] have [[authority]] in particular matters- for [[example]], when the whole [[people]] decide about [[peace]] and [[war]] and hold scrutinies, but the magistrates regulate everything else, and they are elected by vote- there the [[government]] is an [[aristocracy]]. and if some questions [[question]] are decided by magistrates elected by vote, and others by magistrates elected by lot, either absolutely or out of select candidates, or elected partly by vote, partly by lot- these practices are partly characteristic of an aristocratical [[government]], and party of a pure constitutional [[government]]. 

these are the various forms of the deliberative [[body]]; they correspond to the various forms of [[government]]. and the [[government]] of each [[state]] is administered according to one or other of the principles [[principle]] which have been laid down. now it is for the interest of [[democracy]], according to the most prevalent notion of it (i am speaking of that extreme form of [[democracy]] in which the [[people]] are supreme even over the laws), with a view to [[better]] deliberation to adopt the custom of oligarchies respecting courts of [[law]]. for in oligarchies the [[rich]] who are wanted to be judges [[judge]] are compelled to attend under [[pain]] of a fine, whereas in deinocracies the [[poor]] are paid to attend. and this practice of oligarchies should be adopted by democracies [[democracy]] in their [[public]] assemblies, for they will advise [[better]] if they all deliberate together- the [[people]] with the notables and the notables with the [[people]]. it is also a [[good]] plan that those who deliberate should be elected by vote or by lot in [[equal]] numbers out of the different classes; and that if the [[people]] greatly exceed in number those who have [[political]] training, [[pay]] should not be given to all, but only to as many as would balance the number of the notables, or that the number in excess should be eliminated by lot. but in oligarchies either [[certain]] persons [[person]] should be co-opted from the mass, or a class of officers should be appointed such as [[exist]] in some states who are termed probuli and guardians of the [[law]]; and the [[citizens]] should occupy themselves exclusively with matters on which these have previously deliberated; for so the [[people]] will have a share in the deliberations of the [[state]], but will not be able to disturb the principles [[principle]] of the [[constitution]]. again, in oligarchies either the [[people]] ought to accept the measures of the [[government]], or not to pass anything contrary to them; or, if all are allowed to share in counsel, the decision should rest with the magistrates. the opposite of what is done in constitutional governments [[government]] should be the [[rule]] in oligarchies; the veto of the majority should be final, their assent not final, but the proposal should be referred back to the magistrates. whereas in constitutional governments [[government]] they take the contrary course; the few have the negative, not the affirmative [[power]]; the affirmation of everything rests with the multitude. 

these, then, are our conclusions respecting the deliberative, that is, the supreme element in states. 

part xv 

next we will proceed to consider the distribution of offices; this too, being a part of [[politics]] concerning which many questions [[question]] arise: what shall their number be? over what shall they preside, and what shall be their duration? sometimes they [[last]] for six months, sometimes for less; sometimes they are annual, while in other cases offices are held for still longer periods. shall they be for [[life]] or for a long term of years; or, if for a short term only, shall the same persons [[person]] hold them over and over again, or once only? also about the appointment to them- from whom are they to be chosen, by whom, and how? we should first be in a position to say what are the possible varieties of them, and then we may proceed to determine which are suited to different forms of [[government]]. but what are to be included under the term 'offices'? that is a [[question]] not quite so easily answered. for a [[political]] [[community]] requires many officers; and not every one who is chosen by vote or by lot is to be regarded as a ruler. in the first place there are the priests [[priest]], who must be distinguished from [[political]] officers; masters of choruses and heralds, even ambassadors, are elected by vote. some duties [[duty]] of superintendence again are [[political]], extending either to all the [[citizens]] in a [[single]] sphere of action, like the office of the general who superintends them when they are in the field, or to a section of them only, like the inspectorships of [[women]] or of [[youth]]. other offices are concerned with household management, like that of the corn measurers who [[exist]] in many states and are elected officers. there are also menial offices which the [[rich]] have executed by their slaves [[slave]]. speaking generally, those are to be called offices to which the duties [[duty]] are assigned of deliberating about [[certain]] measures and ofjudging and commanding, especially the [[last]]; for to command is the especial [[duty]] of a magistrate. but the [[question]] is not of any importance in practice; no one has ever brought into court the meaning of the word, although such problems have a speculative interest. 

what kinds [[kind]] of offices, and how many, are necessary to the existence of a [[state]], and which, if not necessary, yet conduce to its well being are much more important considerations, affecting all constitutions [[constitution]], but more especially small states. for in [[great]] states it is possible, and indeed necessary, that every office should have a special function; where the [[citizens]] are numerous, many may hold office. and so it happens that some offices a [[man]] holds a second [[time]] only after a long interval, and others he holds once only; and certainly every [[work]] is [[better]] done which receives the sole, and not the divided attention of the worker. but in small states it is necessary to combine many offices in a few hands, since the small number of [[citizens]] does not admit of many holding office: for who will there be to succeed them? and yet small states at times [[time]] require the same offices and laws [[law]] as large ones; the difference is that the one want them often, the others only after long intervals. hence there is no [[reason]] why the [[care]] of many offices should not be imposed on the same [[person]], for they will not interfere with each other. when the [[population]] is small, offices should be like the spits which also serve to hold a lamp. we must first ascertain how many magistrates are necessary in every [[state]], and also how many are not exactly necessary, but are nevertheless useful, and then there will be no difficulty in seeing what offices can be combined in one. we should also [[know]] over which matters several local tribunals are to have jurisdiction, and in which [[authority]] should be centralized: for [[example]], should one [[person]] keep order in the market and another in some other place, or should the same [[person]] be responsible everywhere? again, should offices be divided according to the subjects [[subject]] with which they deal, or according to the persons [[person]] with whom they deal: i mean to say, should one [[person]] see to [[good]] order in general, or one look after the boys, another after the [[women]], and so on? further, under different constitutions [[constitution]], should the magistrates be the same or different? for [[example]], in [[democracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[aristocracy]], [[monarchy]], should there be the same magistrates, although they are elected, not out of [[equal]] or similar classes of citizen but differently under different constitutions- in aristocracies, for [[example]], they are chosen from the educated, in oligarchies from the wealthy, and in democracies [[democracy]] from the free- or are there [[certain]] differences in the offices answering to them as well, and may the same be suitable to some, but different offices to others? for in some states it may be convenient that the same office should have a more extensive, in other states a narrower sphere. special offices are peculiar to [[certain]] forms of [[government]]: for [[example]] that of probuli, which is not a democratic office, although a bule or council is. there must be some [[body]] of [[men]] whose [[duty]] is to prepare measures for the [[people]] in order that they may not be diverted from their [[business]]; when these are few in number, the [[state]] inclines to an [[oligarchy]]: or rather the probuli must always be few, and are therefore an oligarchical element. but when both [[institutions]] [[exist]] in a [[state]], the probuli are a check on the council; for the counselors is a democratic element, but the probuli are oligarchical. even the [[power]] of the council disappears when [[democracy]] has taken that extreme form in which the [[people]] themselves are always meeting and deliberating about everything. this is the case when the members of the assembly receive abundant [[pay]]; for they have nothing to do and are always holding assemblies and deciding everything for themselves. a magistracy which controls the boys or the [[women]], or any similar office, is suited to an [[aristocracy]] rather than to a [[democracy]]; for how can the magistrates prevent the wives [[wife]] of the [[poor]] from going out of doors? neither is it an oligarchical office; for the wives [[wife]] of the oligarchs are too fine to be controlled. 

enough of these matters. i will now inquire into appointments to offices. the varieties depend on three terms, and the combinations of these give all possible modes: first, who appoints? secondly, from whom? and thirdly, how? each of these three admits of three varieties: (a) all the [[citizens]], or (b) only some, appoint. either (1) the magistrates are chosen out of all or (2) out of some who are distinguished either by a [[property]] qualification, or by birth, or [[merit]], or for some special [[reason]], as at megara only those were eligible who had returned from [[exile]] and fought together against the [[democracy]]. they may be appointed either (a) by vote or (b) by lot. again, these several varieties may be coupled, i mean that (c) some officers may be elected by some, others by all, and (3) some again out of some, and others out of all, and (c) some by vote and others by lot. each variety of these terms admits of four modes. 

for either (a 1 a) all may appoint from all by vote, or (a 1 b) all from all by lot, or (a 2 a) all from some by vote, or (a 2 b) all from some by lot (and from all, either by sections, as, for [[example]], by tribes, and wards, and phratries, until all the [[citizens]] have been gone through; or the [[citizens]] may be in all cases eligible indiscriminately); or again (a 1 c, a 2 c) to some offices in the one way, to some in the other. again, if it is only some that appoint, they may do so either (b 1 a) from all by vote, or (b 1 b) from all by lot, or (b 2 a) from some by vote, or (b 2 b) from some by lot, or to some offices in the one way, to others in the other, i.e., (b 1 c) from all, to some offices by vote, to some by lot, and (b 2 c) from some, to some offices by vote, to some by lot. thus the modes that arise, apart from two (c, 3) out of the three couplings, number twelve. of these systems [[system]] two are popular, that all should appoint from all (a 1 a) by vote or (a 1 b) by lot- or (a 1 c) by both. that all should not appoint at once, but should appoint from all or from some either by lot or by vote or by both, or appoint to some offices from all and to others from some ('by both' meaning to some offices by lot, to others by vote), is characteristic of a polity. and (b 1 c) that some should appoint from all, to some offices by vote, to others by lot, is also characteristic of a polity, but more oligarchical than the former method. and (a 3 a, b, c, b 3 a, b, c) to appoint from both, to some offices from all, to others from some, is characteristic of a polity with a leaning towards [[aristocracy]]. that (b 2) some should appoint from some is oligarchical- even (b 2 b) that some should appoint from some by lot (and if this does not actually occur, it is none the less oligarchical in character), or (b 2 c) that some should appoint from some by both. (b 1 a) that some should appoint from all, and (a 2 a) that all should appoint from some, by vote, is aristocratic. 

these are the different modes of constituting magistrates, and these correspond to different forms of [[government]]: which are proper to which, or how they ought to be established, will be evident when we determine the [[nature]] of their powers [[power]]. by powers [[power]] i mean such powers [[power]] as a magistrate exercises over the [[revenue]] or in defense of the [[country]]; for there are various kinds [[kind]] of [[power]]: the [[power]] of the general, for [[example]], is not the same with that which regulates contracts in the market. 

part xvi 

of the three parts of [[government]], the judicial remains to be considered, and this we shall divide on the same [[principle]]. there are three points on which the variedes of law-courts depend: the persons [[person]] from whom they are appointed, the matters with which they are concerned, and the manner of their appointment. i mean, (1) are the judges [[judge]] taken from all, or from some only? (2) how many kinds [[kind]] of law-courts are there? (3) are the judges [[judge]] chosen by vote or by lot? 

first, let me determine how many kinds [[kind]] of law-courts there are. there are eight in number: one is the court of audits or scrutinies; a second takes cognizance of ordinary offenses against the [[state]]; a third is concerned with [[treason]] against the [[constitution]]; the fourth determines disputes respecting penalties, whether raised by magistrates or by private persons [[person]]; the fifth decides the more important civil cases; the sixth tries cases of homicide, which are of various kinds [[kind]], (a) premeditated, (b) involuntary, (c) cases in which the guilt is confessed but the [[justice]] is disputed; and there may be a fourth court (d) in which murderers who have fled from [[justice]] are tried after their return; such as the court of phreatto is said to be at [[athens]]. but cases of this sort rarely happen at all even in large cities [[city]]. the different kinds [[kind]] of homicide may be tried either by the same or by different courts. (7) there are courts for strangers: of these there are two subdivisions, (a) for the settlement of their disputes with one another, (b) for the settlement of disputes between them and the [[citizens]]. and besides all these there must be (8) courts for small suits about sums of a drachma up to five drachmas, or a little more, which have to be determined, but they do not require many judges [[judge]]. 

nothing more need be said of these small suits, nor of the courts for homicide and for strangers: i would rather speak of [[political]] cases, which, when mismanaged, create division and disturbances in constitutions [[constitution]]. 

now if all the [[citizens]] [[judge]], in all the different cases which i have distinguished, they may be appointed by vote or by lot, or sometimes by lot and sometimes by vote. or when a [[single]] class of causes are tried, the judges [[judge]] who decide them may be appointed, some by vote, and some by lot. these then are the four modes of appointing judges [[judge]] from the whole [[people]], and there will be likewise four modes, if they are elected from a part only; for they may be appointed from some by vote and [[judge]] in all causes; or they may be appointed from some by lot and [[judge]] in all causes; or they may be elected in some cases by vote, and in some cases taken by lot, or some courts, even when judging the same causes, may be composed of members some appointed by vote and some by lot. these modes, then, as was said, [[answer]] to those previously mentioned. 

once more, the modes of appointment may be combined; i mean, that some may be chosen out of the whole [[people]], others out of some, some out of both; for [[example]], the same tribunal may be composed of some who were elected out of all, and of others who were elected out of some, either by vote or by lot or by both. 

in how many forms law-courts can be established has now been considered. the first form, viz., that in which the judges [[judge]] are taken from all the [[citizens]], and in which all causes are tried, is democratical; the second, which is composed of a few only who try all causes, oligarchical; the third, in which some courts are taken from all classes, and some from [[certain]] classes only, aristocratical and constitutional.

the design which we proposed to ourselves is now nearly completed. next in order [[follow]] the causes of [[revolution]] in states, how many, and of what [[nature]] they are; what modes of destruction apply to particular states, and out of what, and into what they mostly [[change]]; also what are the modes of preservation in states generally, or in a particular [[state]], and by what means each [[state]] may be [[best]] preserved: these questions [[question]] remain to be considered. 

in the first place we must assume as our starting-point that in the many forms of [[government]] which have sprung up there has always been an acknowledgment of [[justice]] and proportionate equality, although [[mankind]] fail attaining them, as i have already explained. [[democracy]], for [[example]], arises out of the notion that those who are [[equal]] in any [[respect]] are [[equal]] in all respects [[respect]]; because [[men]] are equally [[free]], they claim to be absolutely [[equal]]. [[oligarchy]] is based on the notion that those who are unequal in one [[respect]] are in all respects [[respect]] unequal; being unequal, that is, in [[property]], they suppose themselves to be unequal absolutely. the democrats [[think]] that as they are [[equal]] they ought to be [[equal]] in all things; while the oligarchs, under the [[idea]] that they are unequal, claim too much, which is one form of inequality. all these forms of [[government]] have a [[kind]] of [[justice]], but, tried by an absolute standard, they are faulty; and, therefore, both parties, whenever their share in the [[government]] does not accord with their preconceived ideas [[idea]], stir up [[revolution]]. those who excel in [[virtue]] have the [[best]] [[right]] of all to rebel (for they alone can with [[reason]] be deemed absolutely unequal), but then they are of all [[men]] the least inclined to do so. there is also a superiority which is claimed by [[men]] of rank; for they are [[thought]] [[noble]] because they spring from wealthy and [[virtuous]] [[ancestors]]. here then, so to speak, are opened the very springs and fountains of [[revolution]]; and hence arise two sorts of changes [[change]] in governments [[government]]; the one affecting the [[constitution]], when [[men]] seek to [[change]] from an existing form into some other, for [[example]], from [[democracy]] into [[oligarchy]], and from [[oligarchy]] into [[democracy]], or from either of them into constitutional [[government]] or [[aristocracy]], and conversely; the other not affecting the [[constitution]], when, without disturbing the form of [[government]], whether [[oligarchy]], or [[monarchy]], or any other, they try to get the administration into their own hands. further, there is a [[question]] of [[degree]]; an [[oligarchy]], for [[example]], may become more or less oligarchical, and a [[democracy]] more or less democratical; and in like manner the characteristics of the other forms of [[government]] may be more or less strictly maintained. or the [[revolution]] may be directed against a portion of the [[constitution]] only, e.g., the establishment or overthrow of a particular office: as at sparta it is said that lysander attempted to overthrow the [[monarchy]], and [[king]] pausanias, the ephoralty. at epidamnus, too, the [[change]] was partial. for instead of phylarchs or heads of tribes, a council was appointed; but to this day the magistrates are the only members of the ruling class who are compelled to go to the heliaea when an election takes place, and the office of the [[single]] archon was another oligarchical feature. everywhere inequality is a cause of [[revolution]], but an inequality in which there is no proportion- for instance, a perpetual [[monarchy]] among equals [[equal]]; and always it is the [[desire]] of equality which rises in rebellion. 

now equality is of two kinds [[kind]], numerical and proportional; by the first i mean sameness or equality in number or size; by the second, equality of ratios. for [[example]], the excess of three over two is numerically [[equal]] to the excess of two over one; whereas four exceeds two in the same ratio in which two exceeds one, for two is the same part of four that one is of two, namely, the half. as i was saying before, [[men]] agree that [[justice]] in the abstract is proportion, but they differ in that some [[think]] that if they are [[equal]] in any [[respect]] they are [[equal]] absolutely, others that if they are unequal in any [[respect]] they should be unequal in all. hence there are two principal forms of [[government]], [[democracy]] and [[oligarchy]]; for [[good]] birth and [[virtue]] are rare, but [[wealth]] and numbers are more [[common]]. in what [[city]] shall we find a hundred persons [[person]] of [[good]] birth and of [[virtue]]? whereas the [[rich]] everywhere abound. that a [[state]] should be ordered, simply and wholly, according to either [[kind]] of equality, is not a [[good]] thing; the proof is the [[fact]] that such forms of [[government]] never [[last]]. they are originally based on a mistake, and, as they begin badly, cannot fall to end badly. the inference is that both kinds [[kind]] of equality should be employed; numerical in some cases, and proportionate in others. 

still [[democracy]] appears to be safer and less liable to [[revolution]] than [[oligarchy]]. for in oligarchies there is the double danger of the oligarchs falling out among themselves and also with the [[people]]; but in democracies [[democracy]] there is only the danger of a quarrel with the oligarchs. no dissension worth mentioning arises among the [[people]] themselves. and we may further remark that a [[government]] which is composed of the middle class more nearly approximates to [[democracy]] than to [[oligarchy]], and is the safest of the imperfect forms of [[government]]. 

part ii 

in considering how dissensions and poltical revolutions [[revolution]] arise, we must first of all ascertain the beginnings and causes of them which affect constitutions [[constitution]] generally. they may be said to be three in number; and we have now to give an outline of each. we want to [[know]] (1) what is the feeling? (2) what are the motives of those who make them? (3) whence arise [[political]] disturbances and quarrels? the universal and [[chief]] cause of this revolutionary feeling has been already mentioned; viz., the [[desire]] of equality, when [[men]] [[think]] that they are [[equal]] to others who have more than themselves; or, again, the [[desire]] of inequality and superiority, when conceiving themselves to be superior they [[think]] that they have not more but the same or less than their inferiors; pretensions which may and may not be just. inferiors revolt in order that they may be [[equal]], and equals [[equal]] that they may be superior. such is the [[state]] of [[mind]] which creates revolutions [[revolution]]. the motives for making them are the [[desire]] of gain and [[honor]], or the [[fear]] of dishonor and loss; the authors of them want to divert [[punishment]] or dishonor from themselves or their [[friends]]. the causes and reasons [[reason]] of revolutions [[revolution]], whereby [[men]] are themselves affected in the way described, and about the things which i have mentioned, viewed in one way may be regarded as seven, and in another as more than seven. two of them have been already noticed; but they act in a different manner, for [[men]] are excited against one another by the [[love]] of gain and honor- not, as in the case which i have just supposed, in order to obtain them for themselves, but at seeing others, justly or unjustly, engrossing them. other causes are insolence, [[fear]], excessive predominance, contempt, disproportionate increase in some part of the [[state]]; causes of another sort are election intrigues, carelessness, neglect about trifles, dissimilarity of elements. 

part iii 

what share insolence and avarice have in creating revolutions [[revolution]], and how they [[work]], is plain enough. when the magistrates are insolent and grasping they conspire against one another and also against the [[constitution]] from which they derive their [[power]], making their gains either at the expense of individuals [[individual]] or of the [[public]]. it is evident, again, what an influence [[honor]] exerts and how it is a cause of [[revolution]]. [[men]] who are themselves dishonored and who see others obtaining honors rise in rebellion; the [[honor]] or dishonor when undeserved is [[unjust]]; and just when awarded according to [[merit]]. 

again, superiority is a cause of [[revolution]] when one or more persons [[person]] have a [[power]] which is too much for the [[state]] and the [[power]] of the [[government]]; this is a condition of affairs out of which there arises a [[monarchy]], or a [[family]] [[oligarchy]]. and therefore, in some places, as at [[athens]] and argos, they have recourse to ostracism. but how much [[better]] to provide from the first that there should be no such pre-eminent individuals [[individual]] instead of letting them come into existence and then finding a remedy. 

another cause of [[revolution]] is [[fear]]. either [[men]] have committed [[wrong]], and are afraid of [[punishment]], or they are expecting to suffer [[wrong]] and are desirous of anticipating their [[enemy]]. thus at rhodes the notables conspired against the [[people]] through [[fear]] of the suits that were brought against them. contempt is also a cause of insurrection and [[revolution]]; for [[example]], in oligarchies- when those who have no share in the [[state]] are the majority, they revolt, because they [[think]] that they are the stronger. or, again, in democracies [[democracy]], the [[rich]] despise the disorder and [[anarchy]] of the [[state]]; at thebes, for [[example]], where, after the [[battle]] of oenophyta, the [[bad]] administration of the [[democracy]] [[led]] to its ruin. at megara the fall of the [[democracy]] was due to a defeat occasioned by disorder and [[anarchy]]. and at syracuse the [[democracy]] aroused contempt before the [[tyranny]] of gelo arose; at rhodes, before the insurrection. 

political revolutions [[revolution]] also spring from a disproportionate increase in any part of the [[state]]. for as a [[body]] is made up of many members, and every member ought to grow in proportion, that symmetry may be preserved; but loses its [[nature]] if the foot be four cubits long and the rest of the [[body]] two spans; and, should the abnormal increase be one of quality as well as of quantity, may even take the form of another animal: even so a [[state]] has many parts, of which some one may often grow imperceptibly; for [[example]], the number of [[poor]] in democracies [[democracy]] and in constitutional states. and this disproportion may sometimes happen by an accident, as at tarentum, from a defeat in which many of the notables were slain in a [[battle]] with the iapygians just after the persian [[war]], the constitutional [[government]] in consequence becoming a [[democracy]]; or as was the case at argos, where the argives, after their [[army]] had been cut to pieces on the seventh day of the month by cleomenes the lacedaemonian, were compelled to admit to citizen some of their perioeci; and at [[athens]], when, after frequent defeats of their infantry at the [[time]] of the peloponnesian [[war]], the notables were reduced in number, because the soldiers had to be taken from the roll of [[citizens]]. revolutions [[revolution]] arise from this cause as well, in democracies [[democracy]] as in other forms of [[government]], but not to so [[great]] an extent. when the [[rich]] grow numerous or properties [[property]] increase, the form of [[government]] changes [[change]] into an [[oligarchy]] or a [[government]] of families [[family]]. forms of [[government]] also change- sometimes even without [[revolution]], owing to election contests, as at heraea (where, instead of electing their magistrates, they took them by lot, because the electors were in the habit of choosing their own partisans); or owing to carelessness, when disloyal persons [[person]] are allowed to find their way into the highest offices, as at oreum, where, upon the accession of heracleodorus to office, the [[oligarchy]] was overthrown, and changed by him into a constitutional and democratical [[government]]. 

again, the [[revolution]] may be facilitated by the slightness of the [[change]]; i mean that a [[great]] [[change]] may sometimes slip into the [[constitution]] through neglect of a small matter; at ambracia, for instance, the qualification for office, small at first, was eventually reduced to nothing. for the ambraciots [[thought]] that a small qualification was much the same as none at all. 

another cause of [[revolution]] is difference of races [[race]] which do not at once acquire a [[common]] spirit; for a [[state]] is not the [[growth]] of a day, any more than it grows out of a multitude brought together by accident. hence the reception of strangers in colonies, either at the [[time]] of their foundation or afterwards, has generally produced [[revolution]]; for [[example]], the achaeans who joined the troezenians in the foundation of sybaris, becoming later the more numerous, expelled them; hence the curse fell upon sybaris. at thurii the sybarites quarrelled with their fellow-colonists; thinking that the [[land]] belonged to them, they wanted too much of it and were driven out. at byzantium the new colonists were detected in a conspiracy, and were expelled by [[force]] of arms; the [[people]] of antissa, who had received the chian exiles, fought with them, and drove them out; and the zancleans, after having received the samians, were driven by them out of their own [[city]]. the [[citizens]] of apollonia on the euxine, after the introduction of a fresh [[body]] of colonists, had a [[revolution]]; the syracusans, after the expulsion of their tyrants [[tyrant]], having admitted strangers and mercenaries to the rights [[right]] of citizenship, quarrelled and came to blows; the [[people]] of amphipolis, having received chalcidian colonists, were nearly all expelled by them. 

now, in oligarchies the masses make [[revolution]] under the [[idea]] that they are unjustly treated, because, as i said before, they are equals [[equal]], and have not an [[equal]] share, and in democracies [[democracy]] the notables revolt, because they are not equals [[equal]], and yet have only an [[equal]] share. 

again, the situation of cities [[city]] is a cause of [[revolution]] when the [[country]] is not naturally adapted to preserve the unity of the [[state]]. for [[example]], the chytians at clazomenae did not agree with the [[people]] of the island; and the [[people]] of colophon quarrelled with the notians; at [[athens]] too, the inhabitants of the piraeus are more democratic than those who [[live]] in the [[city]]. for just as in [[war]] the impediment of a ditch, though ever so small, may break a regiment, so every cause of difference, however slight, makes a breach in a [[city]]. the [[greatest]] opposition is confessedly that of [[virtue]] and [[vice]]; next comes that of [[wealth]] and [[poverty]]; and there are other antagonistic elements, greater or less, of which one is this difference of place. 

part iv 

in revolutions [[revolution]] the occasions [[occasion]] may be trifling, but [[great]] interests are at stake. even trifles are most important when they concern the rulers, as was the case of old at syracuse; for the syracusan [[constitution]] was once changed by a love-quarrel of two [[young]] [[men]], who were in the [[government]]. the story is that while one of them was away from [[home]] his beloved was gained over by his companion, and he to [[revenge]] himself seduced the other's [[wife]]. they then drew the members of the ruling class into their quarrel and so split all the [[people]] into portions. we learn from this story that we should be on our guard against the beginnings of such evils [[evil]], and should put an end to the quarrels of chiefs [[chief]] and mighty [[men]]. the mistake lies [[lie]] in the beginning- as the proverb says- 'well begun is half done'; so an error at the beginning, though quite small, bears the same ratio to the errors in the other parts. in general, when the notables quarrel, the whole [[city]] is involved, as happened in hesdaea after the persian [[war]]. the [[occasion]] was the division of an [[inheritance]]; one of two brothers [[brother]] refused to give an account of their father's [[property]] and the treasure which he had found: so the poorer of the two quarrelled with him and enlisted in his cause the popular party, the other, who was very [[rich]], the wealthy classes. 

at delphi, again, a quarrel about a [[marriage]] was the beginning of all the troubles which followed. in this case the bridegroom, fancying some occurrence to be of [[evil]] omen, came to the bride, and went away without taking her. whereupon her relations, thinking that they were insulted by him, put some of the [[sacred]] treasure among his offerings while he was sacrificing, and then slew him, pretending that he had been robbing the temple. at mytilene, too, a dispute about heiresses was the beginning of many misfortunes, and [[led]] to the [[war]] with the athenians in which paches took their [[city]]. a wealthy citizen, named timophanes, left two daughters [[daughter]]; dexander, another citizen, wanted to obtain them for his sons [[son]]; but he was rejected in his suit, whereupon he stirred up a [[revolution]], and instigated the athenians (of whom he was proxenus) to interfere. a similar quarrel about an heiress arose at phocis between mnaseas the [[father]] of mnason, and euthycrates the [[father]] of onomarchus; this was the beginning of the [[sacred]] [[war]]. a marriage-quarrel was also the cause of a [[change]] in the [[government]] of epidamnus. a [[certain]] [[man]] betrothed his [[daughter]] to a [[person]] whose [[father]], having been made a magistrate, fined the [[father]] of the girl, and the latter, stung by the insult, conspired with the unenfranchised classes to overthrow the [[state]]. 

governments also [[change]] into [[oligarchy]] or into [[democracy]] or into a constitutional [[government]] because the magistrates, or some other section of the [[state]], increase in [[power]] or renown. thus at [[athens]] the [[reputation]] gained by the court of the areopagus, in the persian [[war]], seemed to tighten the reins of [[government]]. on the other hand, the [[victory]] of salamis, which was gained by the [[common]] [[people]] who served in the fleet, and won for the athenians the [[empire]] due to command of the sea, strengthened the [[democracy]]. at argos, the notables, having distinguished themselves against the lacedaemonians in the [[battle]] of mantinea, attempted to put down the [[democracy]]. at syracuse, the [[people]], having been the [[chief]] authors of the [[victory]] in the [[war]] with the athenians, changed the constitutional [[government]] into [[democracy]]. at chalcis, the [[people]], uniting with the notables, killed phoxus the [[tyrant]], and then seized the [[government]]. at ambracia, the [[people]], in like manner, having joined with the conspirators in expelling the [[tyrant]] periander, transferred the [[government]] to themselves. and generally it should be remembered that those who have secured [[power]] to the [[state]], whether private [[citizens]], or magistrates, or tribes, or any other part or section of the [[state]], are apt to cause revolutions [[revolution]]. for either envy of their greatness draws others into rebellion, or they themselves, in their [[pride]] of superiority, are unwilling to remain on a level with others. 

revolutions also break out when opposite parties, e.g., the [[rich]] and the [[people]], are equally balanced, and there is little or no middle class; for, if either party were manifestly superior, the other would not risk an attack upon them. and, for this [[reason]], those who are eminent in [[virtue]] usually do not stir up insurrections, always being a minority. such are the beginnings and causes of the disturbances and revolutions [[revolution]] to which every form of [[government]] is liable. 

revolutions are effected in two ways, by [[force]] and by fraud. [[force]] may be applied either at the [[time]] of making the [[revolution]] or afterwards. fraud, again, is of two kinds [[kind]]; for (1) sometimes the [[citizens]] are deceived into acquiescing in a [[change]] of [[government]], and afterwards they are held in subjection against their will. this was what happened in the case of the four hundred, who deceived the [[people]] by telling them that the [[king]] would provide [[money]] for the [[war]] against the lacedaemonians, and, having cheated the [[people]], still endeavored to retain the [[government]]. (2) in other cases the [[people]] are persuaded at first, and afterwards, by a repetition of the persuasion, their goodwill and allegiance are retained. the revolutions [[revolution]] which effect constitutions [[constitution]] generally spring from the above-mentioned causes. 

part v 

and now, taking each [[constitution]] separately, we must see what follows from the principles [[principle]] already laid down. 

revolutions in democracies [[democracy]] are generally caused by the intemperance of demagogues, who either in their private capacity lay information against [[rich]] [[men]] until they compel them to combine (for a [[common]] danger unites even the bitterest enemies), or coming forward in [[public]] stir up the [[people]] against them. the [[truth]] of this remark is proved by a variety of examples [[example]]. at cos the [[democracy]] was overthrown because wicked demagogues arose, and the notables combined. at rhodes the demagogues not only provided [[pay]] for the multitude, but prevented them from making [[good]] to the trierarchs the sums which had been expended by them; and they, in consequence of the suits which were brought against them, were compelled to combine and put down the [[democracy]]. the [[democracy]] at heraclea was overthrown shortly after the foundation of the colony by the [[injustice]] of the demagogues, which drove out the notables, who came back in a [[body]] and put an end to the [[democracy]]. much in the same manner the [[democracy]] at megara was overturned; there the demagogues drove out many of the notables in order that they might be able to confiscate their [[property]]. at length the exiles, becoming numerous, returned, and, engaging and defeating the [[people]], established the [[oligarchy]]. the same thing happened with the [[democracy]] of cyme, which was overthrown by thrasymachus. and we may observe that in most states the changes [[change]] have been of this [[character]]. for sometimes the demagogues, in order to curry favor with the [[people]], [[wrong]] the notables and so [[force]] them to combine; either they make a division of their [[property]], or diminish their incomes by the imposition of [[public]] services, and sometimes they bring accusations against the [[rich]] that they may have their [[wealth]] to confiscate. 

of old, the demagogue was also a general, and then democracies [[democracy]] changed into tyrannies. most of the ancient tyrants [[tyrant]] were originally demagogues. they are not so now, but they were then; and the [[reason]] is that they were generals and not orators, for oratory had not yet come into [[fashion]]. whereas in our day, when the art [[arts]] of rhetoric has made such [[progress]], the orators lead the [[people]], but their ignorance of [[military]] matters prevents them from usurping [[power]]; at any rate instances to the contrary are few and slight. tyrannies were more [[common]] formerly than now, for this [[reason]] also, that [[great]] [[power]] was placed in the hands of individuals [[individual]]; thus a [[tyranny]] arose at miletus out of the office of the prytanis, who had supreme [[authority]] in many important matters. moreover, in those days, when cities [[city]] were not large, the [[people]] dwelt in the fields, busy at their [[work]]; and their chiefs [[chief]], if they possessed any [[military]] talent, seized the opportunity, and winning the confidence of the masses by professing their [[hatred]] of the wealthy, they succeeded in obtaining the [[tyranny]]. thus at [[athens]] peisistratus [[led]] a faction against the [[men]] of the plain, and theagenes at megara slaughtered the cattle of the wealthy, which he found by the river side, where they had put them to graze in [[land]] not their own. dionysius, again, was [[thought]] worthy of the [[tyranny]] because he denounced daphnaeus and the [[rich]]; his enmity to the notables won for him the confidence of the [[people]]. changes [[change]] also take place from the ancient to the latest form of [[democracy]]; for where there is a popular election of the magistrates and no [[property]] qualification, the aspirants for office get hold of the [[people]], and contrive at [[last]] even to set them above the laws [[law]]. a more or less complete cure for this [[state]] of things is for the separate tribes, and not the whole [[people]], to elect the magistrates. 

these are the principal causes of revolutions [[revolution]] in democracies [[democracy]]. 

part vi 

there are two patent causes of revolutions [[revolution]] in oligarchies: (1) first, when the oligarchs [[oppress]] the [[people]], for then anybody is [[good]] enough to be their champion, especially if he be himself a member of the [[oligarchy]], as lygdamis at naxos, who afterwards came to be [[tyrant]]. but revolutions [[revolution]] which commence outside the governing class may be further subdivided. sometimes, when the [[government]] is very exclusive, the [[revolution]] is brought about by persons [[person]] of the wealthy class who are excluded, as happened at massalia and istros and heraclea, and other cities [[city]]. those who had no share in the [[government]] created a disturbance, until first the elder brothers [[brother]], and then the younger, were admitted; for in some places [[father]] and [[son]], in others elder and younger brothers [[brother]], do not hold office together. at massalia the [[oligarchy]] became more like a constitutional [[government]], but at istros ended in a [[democracy]], and at heraclea was enlarged to 600. at cnidos, again, the [[oligarchy]] underwent a considerable [[change]]. for the notables fell out among themselves, because only a few shared in the [[government]]; there existed among them the [[rule]] already mentioned, that [[father]] and [[son]] not hold office together, and, if there were several brothers [[brother]], only the eldest was admitted. the [[people]] took advantage of the quarrel, and choosing one of the notables to be their leader, attacked and conquered the oligarchs, who were divided, and division is always a source of weakness. the [[city]] of erythrae, too, in old times [[time]] was ruled, and ruled well, by the basilidae, but the [[people]] took offense at the narrowness of the [[oligarchy]] and changed the [[constitution]]. 

(2) of internal causes of revolutions [[revolution]] in oligarchies one is the personal rivalry of the oligarchs, which leads them to play the demagogue. now, the oligarchical demagogue is of two sorts: either (a) he practices upon the oligarchs themselves (for, although the [[oligarchy]] are quite a small number, there may be a demagogue among them, as at [[athens]] charicles' party won [[power]] by courting the thirty, that of phrynichus by courting the four hundred); or (b) the oligarchs may play the demagogue with the [[people]]. this was the case at larissa, where the guardians of the [[citizens]] endeavored to gain over the [[people]] because they were elected by them; and such is the [[fate]] of all oligarchies in which the magistrates are elected, as at abydos, not by the class to which they belong, but by the heavy-armed or by the [[people]], although they may be required to have a high qualification, or to be members of a [[political]] club; or, again, where the law-courts are composed of persons [[person]] outside the [[government]], the oligarchs flatter the [[people]] in order to obtain a decision in their own favor, and so they [[change]] the [[constitution]]; this happened at heraclea in pontus. again, oligarchies [[change]] whenever any attempt is made to narrow them; for then those who [[desire]] [[equal]] rights [[right]] are compelled to call in the [[people]]. changes [[change]] in the [[oligarchy]] also occur when the oligarchs waste their private [[property]] by extravagant living; for then they want to innovate, and either try to make themselves tyrants [[tyrant]], or install some one else in the [[tyranny]], as hipparinus did dionysius at syracuse, and as at amphipolis a [[man]] named cleotimus introduced chalcidian colonists, and when they arrived, stirred them up against the [[rich]]. for a like [[reason]] in aegina the [[person]] who carried on the negotiation with chares endeavored to revolutionize the [[state]]. sometimes a party among the oligarchs try directly to create a [[political]] [[change]]; sometimes they rob the treasury, and then either the thieves or, as happened at apollonia in pontus, those who resist them in their thieving quarrel with the rulers. but an [[oligarchy]] which is at unity with itself is not easily destroyed from within; of this we may see an [[example]] at pharsalus, for there, although the rulers are few in number, they govern a large [[city]], because they have a [[good]] understanding among themselves. 

oligarchies, again, are overthrown when another [[oligarchy]] is created within the original one, that is to say, when the whole governing [[body]] is small and yet they do not all share in the highest offices. thus at elis the governing [[body]] was a small senate; and very few ever found their way into it, because the senators were only ninety in number, and were elected for [[life]] and out of [[certain]] families [[family]] in a manner similar to the lacedaemonian elders. [[oligarchy]] is liable to revolutions [[revolution]] alike in [[war]] and in [[peace]]; in [[war]] because, not being able to trust the [[people]], the oligarchs are compelled to hire mercenaries, and the general who is in command of them often ends in becoming a [[tyrant]], as timophanes did at corinth; or if there are more generals than one they make themselves into a company of tyrants [[tyrant]]. sometimes the oligarchs, fearing this danger, give the [[people]] a share in the [[government]] because their services are necessary to them. and in [[time]] of [[peace]], from mutual distrust, the two parties hand over the defense of the [[state]] to the [[army]] and to an arbiter between the two factions, who often ends the master of both. this happened at larissa when simos the aleuad had the [[government]], and at abydos in the days of iphiades and the [[political]] clubs. revolutions [[revolution]] also arise out of marriages [[marriage]] or lawsuits which lead to the overthrow of one party among the oligarchs by another. of quarrels about marriages [[marriage]] i have already mentioned some instances; another occurred at eretria, where diagoras overturned the [[oligarchy]] of the knights because he had been wronged about a [[marriage]]. a [[revolution]] at heraclea, and another at thebes, both arose out of decisions of law-courts upon a charge of adultery; in both cases the [[punishment]] was just, but executed in the spirit of party, at heraclea upon eurytion, and at thebes upon archias; for their enemies [[enemy]] were [[jealous]] of them and so had them pilloried in the agora. many oligarchies have been destroyed by some members of the ruling class taking offense at their excessive despotism; for [[example]], the [[oligarchy]] at cnidus and at chios. 

changes of constitutional governments [[government]], and also of oligarchies which limit the office of counselor, [[judge]], or other magistrate to persons [[person]] having a [[certain]] [[money]] qualification, often occur by accident. the qualification may have been originally fixed according to the circumstances of the [[time]], in such a manner as to include in an [[oligarchy]] a few only, or in a constitutional [[government]] the middle class. but after a [[time]] of [[prosperity]], whether arising from [[peace]] or some other [[good]] [[fortune]], the same [[property]] becomes many times [[time]] as valuable, and then everybody participates in every office; this happens sometimes gradually and insensibly, and sometimes quickly. these are the causes of changes [[change]] and revolutions [[revolution]] in oligarchies. 

we must remark generally both of democracies [[democracy]] and oligarchies, that they sometimes [[change]], not into the opposite forms of [[government]], but only into another variety of the same class; i mean to say, from those forms of [[democracy]] and [[oligarchy]] which are regulated by [[law]] into those which are arbitrary, and conversely.

in aristocracies revolutions [[revolution]] are stirred up when a few only share in the honors of the [[state]]; a cause which has been already shown to affect oligarchies; for an [[aristocracy]] is a sort of [[oligarchy]], and, like an [[oligarchy]], is the [[government]] of a few, although few not for the same [[reason]]; hence the two are often confounded. and revolutions [[revolution]] will be most likely to happen, and must happen, when the mass of the [[people]] are of the high-spirited [[kind]], and have a notion that they are as [[good]] as their rulers. thus at lacedaemon the so-called partheniae, who were the [illegitimate] sons [[son]] of the spartan peers, attempted a [[revolution]], and, being detected, were sent away to colonize tarentum. again, revolutions [[revolution]] occur when [[great]] [[men]] who are at least of [[equal]] [[merit]] are dishonored by those higher in office, as lysander was by the kings [[king]] of sparta; or, when a brave [[man]] is excluded from the honors of the [[state]], like cinadon, who conspired against the spartans in the reign of agesilaus; or, again, when some are very [[poor]] and others very [[rich]], a [[state]] of [[society]] which is most often the result of [[war]], as at lacedaemon in the days of the messenian [[war]]; this is proved from the poem of tyrtaeus, entitled 'good order'; for he speaks of [[certain]] [[citizens]] who were ruined by the [[war]] and wanted to have a redistribution of the [[land]]. again, revolutions [[revolution]] arise when an [[individual]] who is [[great]], and might be greater, wants to [[rule]] alone, as, at lacedaemon, pausanias, who was general in the persian [[war]], or like hanno at [[carthage]]. 

constitutional governments [[government]] and aristocracies are commonly overthrown owing to some deviation from [[justice]] in the [[constitution]] itself; the cause of the downfall is, in the former, the ill-mingling of the two elements, [[democracy]] and [[oligarchy]]; in the latter, of the three elements, [[democracy]], [[oligarchy]], and [[virtue]], but especially [[democracy]] and [[oligarchy]]. for to combine these is the endeavor of constitutional governments [[government]]; and most of the so-called aristocracies have a like aim, but differ from polities in the mode of combination; hence some of them are more and some less permanent. those which incline more to [[oligarchy]] are called aristocracies, and those which incline to [[democracy]] constitutional governments [[government]]. and therefore the latter are the safer of the two; for the greater the number, the greater the [[strength]], and when [[men]] are [[equal]] they are contented. but the [[rich]], if the [[constitution]] gives them [[power]], are apt to be insolent and avaricious; and, in general, whichever way the [[constitution]] inclines, in that direction it changes [[change]] as either party gains [[strength]], a constitutional [[government]] becoming a [[democracy]], an [[aristocracy]] an [[oligarchy]]. but the process may be reversed, and [[aristocracy]] may [[change]] into [[democracy]]. this happens when the [[poor]], under the [[idea]] that they are being wronged, [[force]] the [[constitution]] to take an opposite form. in like manner constitutional governments [[government]] [[change]] into oligarchies. the only stable [[principle]] of [[government]] is equality according to proportion, and for every [[man]] to enjoy his own. 

what i have just mentioned actually happened at thurii, where the qualification for office, at first high, was therefore reduced, and the magistrates increased in number. the notables had previously acquired the whole of the [[land]] contrary to [[law]]; for the [[government]] tended to [[oligarchy]], and they were able to encroach.... but the [[people]], who had been trained by [[war]], soon got the [[better]] of the guards kept by the oligarchs, until those who had too much gave up their [[land]]. 

again, since all aristocratical governments [[government]] incline to [[oligarchy]], the notables are apt to be grasping; thus at lacedaemon, where [[property]] tends to pass into few hands, the notables can do too much as they like, and are allowed to [[marry]] whom they please. the [[city]] of locri was ruined by a [[marriage]] connection with dionysius, but such a thing could never have happened in a [[democracy]], or in a wellbalanced [[aristocracy]]. 

i have already remarked that in all states revolutions [[revolution]] are occasioned by trifles. in aristocracies, above all, they are of a gradual and imperceptible [[nature]]. the [[citizens]] begin by giving up some part of the [[constitution]], and so with greater ease the [[government]] [[change]] something else which is a little more important, until they have undermined the whole fabric of the [[state]]. at thurii there was a [[law]] that generals should only be re-elected after an interval of five years, and some [[young]] [[men]] who were popular with the soldiers of the guard for their [[military]] prowess, despising the magistrates and thinking that they would easily gain their [[purpose]], wanted to abolish this [[law]] and allow their generals to hold perpetual commands; for they well knew that the [[people]] would be glad enough to elect them. whereupon the magistrates who had charge of these matters, and who are called councillors, at first determined to resist, but they afterwards consented, thinking that, if only this one [[law]] was changed, no further inroad would be made on the [[constitution]]. but other changes [[change]] soon followed which they in [[vain]] attempted to oppose; and the [[state]] passed into the hands of the revolutionists, who established a dynastic [[oligarchy]]. 

all constitutions [[constitution]] are overthrown either from within or from without; the latter, when there is some [[government]] close at hand having an opposite interest, or at a distance, but powerful. this was exemplified in the old times [[time]] of the athenians and the lacedaemonians; the athenians everywhere put down the oligarchies, and the lacedaemonians the democracies [[democracy]]. 

i have now explained what are the [[chief]] causes of revolutions [[revolution]] and dissensions in states. 

part viii 

we have next to consider what means there are of preserving constitutions [[constitution]] in general, and in particular cases. in the first place it is evident that if we [[know]] the causes which [[destroy]] constitutions [[constitution]], we also [[know]] the causes which preserve them; for opposites [[produce]] opposites, and destruction is the opposite of preservation. 

in all well-attempered governments [[government]] there is nothing which should be more jealously maintained than the spirit of [[obedience]] to [[law]], more especially in small matters; for transgression creeps in unperceived and at [[last]] ruins the [[state]], just as the constant recurrence of small expenses in [[time]] eats up a [[fortune]]. the expense does not take place at once, and therefore is not observed; the [[mind]] is deceived, as in the fallacy which says that 'if each part is little, then the whole is little.' this is true in one way, but not in another, for the whole and the all are not little, although they are made up of littles. 

in the first place, then, [[men]] should guard against the beginning of [[change]], and in the second place they should not rely upon the [[political]] devices of which i have already spoken [[invented]] only to [[deceive]] the [[people]], for they are proved by [[experience]] to be useless. further, we note that oligarchies as well as aristocracies may [[last]], not from any inherent stability in such forms of [[government]], but because the rulers are on [[good]] terms both with the unenfranchised and with the governing classes, not maltreating any who are excluded from the [[government]], but introducing into it the leading spirits among them. they should never [[wrong]] the ambitious in a matter of [[honor]], or the [[common]] [[people]] in a matter of [[money]]; and they should treat one another and their fellow citizen in a spirit of equality. the equality which the [[friends]] of [[democracy]] seek to establish for the multitude is not only just but likewise expedient among equals [[equal]]. hence, if the governing class are numerous, many democratic [[institutions]] are useful; for [[example]], the restriction of the tenure of offices to six months, that all those who are of [[equal]] rank may share in them. indeed, equals [[equal]] or peers when they are numerous become a [[kind]] of [[democracy]], and therefore demagogues are very likely to arise among them, as i have already remarked. the short tenure of office prevents oligarchies and aristocracies from falling into the hands of families [[family]]; it is not easy for a [[person]] to do any [[great]] harm when his tenure of office is short, whereas long possession begets [[tyranny]] in oligarchies and democracies [[democracy]]. for the aspirants to [[tyranny]] are either the principal [[men]] of the [[state]], who in democracies [[democracy]] are demagogues and in oligarchies members of ruling houses, or those who hold [[great]] offices, and have a long tenure of them. 

constitutions are preserved when their destroyers are at a distance, and sometimes also because they are near, for the [[fear]] of them makes the [[government]] keep in hand the [[constitution]]. wherefore the ruler who has a [[care]] of the [[constitution]] should invent terrors, and bring distant dangers near, in order that the [[citizens]] may be on their guard, and, like sentinels in a night watch, never relax their attention. he should endeavor too by [[help]] of the laws [[law]] to control the contentions and quarrels of the notables, and to prevent those who have not hitherto taken part in them from catching the spirit of contention. no ordinary [[man]] can discern the beginning of [[evil]], but only the true statesman. 

as to the [[change]] produced in oligarchies and constitutional governments [[government]] by the alteration of the qualification, when this arises, not out of any variation in the qualification but only out of the increase of [[money]], it is well to compare the general valuation of [[property]] with that of [[past]] years, annually in those cities [[city]] in which the census is taken annually and in larger cities [[city]] every third or fifth year. if the whole is many times [[time]] greater or many times [[time]] less than when the ratings recognized by the [[constitution]] were fixed, there should be [[power]] given by [[law]] to raise or lower the qualification as the amount is greater or less. where this is not done a constitutional [[government]] passes into an [[oligarchy]], and an [[oligarchy]] is narrowed to a [[rule]] of families [[family]]; or in the opposite case constitutional [[government]] becomes [[democracy]], and [[oligarchy]] either constitutional [[government]] or [[democracy]]. 

it is a [[principle]] [[common]] to [[democracy]], [[oligarchy]], and every other form of [[government]] not to allow the disproportionate increase of any citizen but to give moderate [[honor]] for a long [[time]] rather than [[great]] [[honor]] for a short [[time]]. for [[men]] are easily spoilt; not every one can bear [[prosperity]]. but if this [[rule]] is not observed, at any rate the honors which are given all at once should be taken away by degrees [[degree]] and not all at once. especially should the laws [[law]] provide against any one having too much [[power]], whether derived from [[friends]] or [[money]]; if he has, he should be sent clean out of the [[country]]. and since innovations creep in through the private [[life]] of individuals [[individual]] also, there ought to be a magistracy which will have an eye to those whose [[life]] is not in harmony with the [[government]], whether [[oligarchy]] or [[democracy]] or any other. and for a like [[reason]] an increase of [[prosperity]] in any part of the [[state]] should be carefully watched. the proper remedy for this [[evil]] is always to give the management of affairs and offices of [[state]] to opposite elements; such opposites are the [[virtuous]] and the many, or the [[rich]] and the [[poor]]. another way is to combine the [[poor]] and the [[rich]] in one [[body]], or to increase the middle class: thus an end will be put to the revolutions [[revolution]] which arise from inequality. 

but above all every [[state]] should be so administered and so regulated by [[law]] that its magistrates cannot possibly make [[money]]. in oligarchies special precautions should be used against this [[evil]]. for the [[people]] do not take any [[great]] offense at being kept out of the government- indeed they are rather pleased than otherwise at having leisure for their private business- but what irritates them is to [[think]] that their rulers are stealing the [[public]] [[money]]; then they are doubly annoyed; for they lose both [[honor]] and [[profit]]. if office brought no [[profit]], then and then only could [[democracy]] and [[aristocracy]] be combined; for both notables and [[people]] might have their wishes [[wish]] gratified. all would be able to hold office, which is the aim of [[democracy]], and the notables would be magistrates, which is the aim of [[aristocracy]]. and this result may be accomplished when there is no possibility of making [[money]] out of the offices; for the [[poor]] will not want to have them when there is nothing to be gained from them- they would rather be attending to their own concerns; and the [[rich]], who do not want [[money]] from the [[public]] treasury, will be able to take them; and so the [[poor]] will keep to their [[work]] and grow [[rich]], and the notables will not be governed by the lower class. in order to avoid peculation of the [[public]] [[money]], the transfer of the [[revenue]] should be made at a general assembly of the [[citizens]], and duplicates of the accounts deposited with the different brotherhoods, companies, and tribes. and honors should be given by [[law]] to magistrates who have the [[reputation]] of being incorruptible. in democracies [[democracy]] the [[rich]] should be spared; not only should their [[property]] not be divided, but their incomes also, which in some states are taken from them imperceptibly, should be protected. it is a [[good]] thing to prevent the wealthy [[citizens]], even if they are willing from undertaking expensive and useless [[public]] services, such as the giving of choruses, torch-races, and the like. in an [[oligarchy]], on the other hand, [[great]] [[care]] should be taken of the [[poor]], and lucrative offices should go to them; if any of the wealthy classes insult them, the offender should be punished more severely than if he had wronged one of his own class. provision should be made that estates pass by [[inheritance]] and not by gift, and no [[person]] should have more than one [[inheritance]]; for in this way properties [[property]] will be equalized, and more of the [[poor]] rise to competency. it is also expedient both in a [[democracy]] and in an [[oligarchy]] to assign to those who have less share in the [[government]] (i.e., to the [[rich]] in a [[democracy]] and to the [[poor]] in an oligarchy) an equality or preference in all but the principal offices of [[state]]. the latter should be entrusted chiefly or only to members of the governing class. 

part ix 

there are three qualifications required in those who have to fill the highest offices- (1) first of all, loyalty to the established [[constitution]]; (2) the [[greatest]] administrative capacity; (3) [[virtue]] and [[justice]] of the [[kind]] proper to each form of [[government]]; for, if what is just is not the same in all governments [[government]], the quality of [[justice]] must also differ. there may be a [[doubt]], however, when all these qualities do not meet in the same [[person]], how the selection is to be made; suppose, for [[example]], a [[good]] general is a [[bad]] [[man]] and not a friend to the [[constitution]], and another [[man]] is [[loyal]] and just, which should we choose? in making the election ought we not to consider two points? what qualities are [[common]], and what are rare. thus in the [[choice]] of a general, we should regard his [[skill]] rather than his [[virtue]]; for few have [[military]] [[skill]], but many have [[virtue]]. in any office of trust or stewardship, on the other hand, the opposite [[rule]] should be observed; for more [[virtue]] than ordinary is required in the holder of such an office, but the necessary [[knowledge]] is of a sort which all [[men]] possess. 

it may, however, be [[asked]] what a [[man]] wants with [[virtue]] if he have [[political]] ability and is [[loyal]], since these two qualities alone will make him do what is for the [[public]] interest. but may not [[men]] have both of them and yet be deficient in self-control? if, knowing and loving their own interests, they do not always attend to them, may they not be equally negligent of the interests of the [[public]]? 

speaking generally, we may say that whatever legal enactments are held to be for the interest of various constitutions [[constitution]], all these preserve them. and the [[great]] preserving [[principle]] is the one which has been repeatedly mentioned- to have a [[care]] that the [[loyal]] citizen should be stronger than the disloyal. neither should we forget the mean, which at the [[present]] day is lost sight of in perverted forms of [[government]]; for many practices which appear to be democratical are the ruin of democracies [[democracy]], and many which appear to be oligarchical are the ruin of oligarchies. those who [[think]] that all [[virtue]] is to be found in their own party principles [[principle]] push matters to extremes; they do not consider that disproportion destroys a [[state]]. a nose which varies from the ideal of straightness to a hook or snub may still be of [[good]] shape and agreeable to the eye; but if the excess be very [[great]], all symmetry is lost, and the nose at [[last]] ceases to be a nose at all on account of some excess in one direction or defect in the other; and this is true of every other part of the [[human]] [[body]]. the same [[law]] of proportion equally holds in states. [[oligarchy]] or [[democracy]], although a departure from the most [[perfect]] form, may yet be a [[good]] enough [[government]], but if any one attempts to push the principles [[principle]] of either to an extreme, he will begin by spoiling the [[government]] and end by having none at all. wherefore the legislator and the statesman ought to [[know]] what democratical measures save and what [[destroy]] a [[democracy]], and what oligarchical measures save or [[destroy]] an [[oligarchy]]. for neither the one nor the other can [[exist]] or continue to [[exist]] unless both [[rich]] and [[poor]] are included in it. if equality of [[property]] is introduced, the [[state]] must of necessity take another form; for when by laws [[law]] carried to excess one or other element in the [[state]] is ruined, the [[constitution]] is ruined. 

there is an error [[common]] both to oligarchies and to democracies [[democracy]]: in the latter the demagogues, when the multitude are above the [[law]], are always cutting the [[city]] in two by quarrels with the [[rich]], whereas they should always profess to be maintaining their cause; just as in oligarchies the oligarchs should profess to maintaining the cause of the [[people]], and should take oaths the opposite of those which they now take. for there are cities [[city]] in which they swear- 'i will be an [[enemy]] to the [[people]], and will devise all the harm against them which i can'; but they ought to exhibit and to entertain the very opposite feeling; in the form of their oath there should be an express declaration- 'i will do no [[wrong]] to the [[people]].' 

but of all the things which i have mentioned that which most contributes to the permanence of constitutions [[constitution]] is the adaptation of [[education]] to the form of [[government]], and yet in our own day this [[principle]] is universally neglected. the [[best]] laws [[law]], though sanctioned by every citizen of the [[state]], will be of no avail unless the [[young]] are trained by habit and [[education]] in the spirit of the [[constitution]], if the laws [[law]] are democratical, democratically or oligarchically, if the laws [[law]] are oligarchical. for there may be a want of self-discipline in states as well as in individuals [[individual]]. now, to have been educated in the spirit of the [[constitution]] is not to perform the actions in which oligarchs or democrats delight, but those by which the existence of an [[oligarchy]] or of a [[democracy]] is made possible. whereas among ourselves the sons [[son]] of the ruling class in an [[oligarchy]] [[live]] in luxury, but the sons [[son]] of the [[poor]] are hardened by exercise and toil, and hence they are both more inclined and [[better]] able to make a [[revolution]]. and in democracies [[democracy]] of the more extreme type there has arisen a false [[idea]] of [[freedom]] which is contradictory to the true interests of the [[state]]. for two principles [[principle]] are characteristic of [[democracy]], the [[government]] of the majority and [[freedom]]. [[men]] [[think]] that what is just is [[equal]]; and that equality is the [[supremacy]] of the popular will; and that [[freedom]] means the doing what a [[man]] likes. in such democracies [[democracy]] every one lives [[life]] as he pleases, or in the words of euripides, 'according to his fancy.' but this is all [[wrong]]; [[men]] should not [[think]] it [[slavery]] to [[live]] according to the [[rule]] of the [[constitution]]; for it is their salvation. 

i have now discussed generally the causes of the [[revolution]] and destruction of states, and the means of their preservation and continuance. 

part x 

i have still to speak of [[monarchy]], and the causes of its destruction and preservation. what i have said already respecting forms of constitutional [[government]] applies almost equally to [[royal]] and to [[tyrannical]] [[rule]]. for [[royal]] [[rule]] is of the [[nature]] of an [[aristocracy]], and a [[tyranny]] is a compound of [[oligarchy]] and [[democracy]] in their most extreme forms; it is therefore most injurious to its subjects [[subject]], being made up of two [[evil]] forms of [[government]], and having the perversions and errors of both. these two forms of [[monarchy]] are contrary in their very origin. the appointment of a [[king]] is the resource of the [[better]] classes against the [[people]], and he is elected by them out of their own number, because either he himself or his [[family]] excel in [[virtue]] and [[virtuous]] actions; whereas a [[tyrant]] is chosen from the [[people]] to be their protector against the notables, and in order to prevent them from being injured. [[history]] shows that almost all tyrants [[tyrant]] have been demagogues who gained the favor of the [[people]] by their accusation of the notables. at any rate this was the manner in which the tyrannies arose in the days when cities [[city]] had increased in [[power]]. others which were older originated in the [[ambition]] of kings [[king]] wanting to overstep the limits of their hereditary [[power]] and become despots. others again grew out of the class which were chosen to be [[chief]] magistrates; for in ancient times [[time]] the [[people]] who elected them gave the magistrates, whether civil or [[religious]], a long tenure. others arose out of the custom which oligarchies had of making some [[individual]] supreme over the highest offices. in any of these ways an ambitious [[man]] had no difficulty, if he [[desired]], in creating a [[tyranny]], since he had the [[power]] in his hands already, either as [[king]] or as one of the officers of [[state]]. thus pheidon at argos and several others were originally kings [[king]], and ended by becoming tyrants [[tyrant]]; phalaris, on the other hand, and the ionian tyrants [[tyrant]], acquired the [[tyranny]] by holding [[great]] offices. whereas panaetius at leontini, cypselus at corinth, peisistratus at [[athens]], dionysius at syracuse, and several others who afterwards became tyrants [[tyrant]], were at first demagogues. 

and so, as i was saying, royalty ranks with [[aristocracy]], for it is based upon [[merit]], whether of the [[individual]] or of his [[family]], or on benefits conferred, or on these claims with [[power]] added to them. for all who have obtained this [[honor]] have benefited, or had in their [[power]] to benefit, states and nations; some, like codrus, have prevented the [[state]] from being enslaved in [[war]]; others, like cyrus, have given their [[country]] [[freedom]], or have settled or gained a territory, like the lacedaemonian, macedonian, and molossian kings [[king]]. the [[idea]] of a [[king]] is to be a protector of the [[rich]] against [[unjust]] treatment, of the [[people]] against insult and oppression. whereas a [[tyrant]], as has often been repeated, has no regard to any [[public]] interest, except as conducive to his private ends; his aim is [[pleasure]], the aim of a [[king]], [[honor]]. wherefore also in their desires [[desire]] they differ; the [[tyrant]] is desirous of riches [[rich]], the [[king]], of what brings [[honor]]. and the guards of a [[king]] are [[citizens]], but of a [[tyrant]] mercenaries. 

that [[tyranny]] has all the vices [[vice]] both of [[democracy]] and [[oligarchy]] is evident. as of [[oligarchy]] so of [[tyranny]], the end is [[wealth]]; (for by [[wealth]] only can the [[tyrant]] maintain either his guard or his luxury). both mistrust the [[people]], and therefore deprive them of their arms. both agree too in injuring the [[people]] and driving them out of the [[city]] and dispersing them. from [[democracy]] tyrants [[tyrant]] have borrowed the art [[arts]] of making [[war]] upon the notables and destroying them secretly or openly, or of exiling them because they are rivals and stand in the way of their [[power]]; and also because plots against them are contrived by [[men]] of this dass, who either want to [[rule]] or to escape subjection. hence periander advised thrasybulus by cutting off the tops of the tallest ears of corn, meaning that he must always put out of the way the [[citizens]] who overtop the rest. and so, as i have already intimated, the beginnings of [[change]] are the same in monarchies [[monarchy]] as in forms of constitutional [[government]]; subjects [[subject]] attack their sovereigns [[sovereign]] out of [[fear]] or contempt, or because they have been unjustly treated by them. and of [[injustice]], the most [[common]] form is insult, another is confiscation of [[property]]. 

the ends sought by conspiracies against monarchies [[monarchy]], whether tyrannies or royalties, are the same as the ends sought by conspiracies against other forms of [[government]]. monarchs have [[great]] [[wealth]] and [[honor]], which are objects of [[desire]] to all [[mankind]]. the attacks are made sometimes against their lives [[life]], sometimes against the office; where the sense of insult is the motive, against their lives [[life]]. any sort of insult (and there are many) may stir up anger, and when [[men]] are angry, they commonly act out of [[revenge]], and not from [[ambition]]. for [[example]], the attempt made upon the peisistratidae arose out of the [[public]] dishonor offered to the sister of harmodius and the insult to himself. he attacked the [[tyrant]] for his sister's sake, and aristogeiton joined in the attack for the sake of harmodius. a conspiracy was also formed against periander, the [[tyrant]] of ambracia, because, when drinking with a favorite [[youth]], he [[asked]] him whether by this [[time]] he was not with child by him. philip, too, was attacked by pausanias because he permitted him to be insulted by attalus and his [[friends]], and amyntas the little, by derdas, because he boasted of having enjoyed his [[youth]]. evagoras of cyprus, again, was slain by the eunuch to [[revenge]] an insult; for his [[wife]] had been carried off by evagoras's [[son]]. many conspiracies have originated in shameful attempts made by sovereigns [[sovereign]] on the persons [[person]] of their subjects [[subject]]. such was the attack of crataeas upon archelaus; he had always hated the connection with him, and so, when archelaus, having promised him one of his two daughters [[daughter]] in [[marriage]], did not give him either of them, but broke his word and [[married]] the elder to the [[king]] of elymeia, when he was hard pressed in a [[war]] against sirrhas and arrhabaeus, and the younger to his own [[son]] amyntas, under the [[idea]] that amyntas would then be less likely to quarrel with his [[son]] by cleopatra- crataeas made this slight a pretext for attacking archelaus, though even a less [[reason]] would have sufficed, for the real cause of the estrangement was the disgust which he [[felt]] at his connection with the [[king]]. and from a like motive hellonocrates of larissa conspired with him; for when archelaus, who was his lover, did not fulfill his promise of restoring him to his [[country]], he [[thought]] that the connection between them had originated, not in affection, but in the wantonness of [[power]]. pytho, too, and heracleides of aenos, slew cotys in order to avenge their [[father]], and adamas revolted from cotys in [[revenge]] for the wanton outrage which he had committed in mutilating him when a child. 

many, too, irritated at blows inflicted on the [[person]] which they deemed an insult, have either killed or attempted to kill officers of [[state]] and [[royal]] princes [[prince]] by whom they have been injured. thus, at mytilene, megacles and his [[friends]] attacked and slew the penthilidae, as they were going about and striking [[people]] with clubs. at a later date smerdis, who had been beaten and torn away from his [[wife]] by penthilus, slew him. in the conspiracy against archelaus, decamnichus stimulated the fury of the assassins and [[led]] the attack; he was enraged because archelaus had delivered him to euripides to be scourged; for the poet had been irritated at some remark made by decamnichus on the foulness of his breath. many other examples [[example]] might be cited of murders and conspiracies which have arisen from similar causes. 

fear is another motive which, as we have said, has caused conspiracies as well in monarchies [[monarchy]] as in more popular forms of [[government]]. thus artapanes conspired against xerxes and slew him, fearing that he would be accused of hanging darius against his orders-he having been under the impression that xerxes would forget what he had said in the middle of a meal, and that the offense would be forgiven. 

another motive is contempt, as in the case of sardanapalus, whom some one saw carding wool with his [[women]], if the storytellers say truly; and the tale may be true, if not of him, of some one else. dion attacked the younger dionysius because he despised him, and saw that he was equally despised by his own subjects [[subject]], and that he was always drunk. even the [[friends]] of a [[tyrant]] will sometimes attack him out of contempt; for the confidence which he reposes in them breeds contempt, and they [[think]] that they will not be found out. the expectation of [[success]] is likewise a sort of contempt; the assailants are ready to strike, and [[think]] nothing of the danger, because they seem to have the [[power]] in their hands. thus generals of armies [[army]] attack monarchs; as, for [[example]], cyrus attacked astyages, despising the effeminacy of his [[life]], and believing that his [[power]] was worn out. thus again, seuthes the thracian conspired against amadocus, whose general he was. 

and sometimes [[men]] are actuated by more than one motive, like mithridates, who conspired against ariobarzanes, partly out of contempt and partly from the [[love]] of gain. 

bold natures [[nature]], placed by their sovereigns [[sovereign]] in a high [[military]] position, are most likely to make the attempt in the expectation of [[success]]; for [[courage]] is emboldened by [[power]], and the union of the two inspires them with the [[hope]] of an easy [[victory]]. 

attempts of which the motive is [[ambition]] arise in a different way as well as in those already mentioned. there are [[men]] who will not risk their lives [[life]] in the [[hope]] of gains and honors however [[great]], but who nevertheless regard the killing of a [[tyrant]] simply as an extraordinary action which will make them famous and honorable in the [[world]]; they [[wish]] to acquire, not a [[kingdom]], but a name. it is rare, however, to find such [[men]]; he who would kill a [[tyrant]] must be prepared to lose his [[life]] if he fail. he must have the resolution of dion, who, when he made [[war]] upon dionysius, took with him very few [[troops]], saying 'that whatever measure of [[success]] he might attain would be enough for him, even if he were to [[die]] the moment he landed; such a [[death]] would be welcome to him.' this is a temper to which few can attain. 

once more, tyrannies, like all other governments [[government]], are destroyed from without by some opposite and more powerful form of [[government]]. that such a [[government]] will have the will to attack them is clear; for the two are opposed in [[principle]]; and all [[men]], if they can, do what they will. [[democracy]] is antagonistic to [[tyranny]], on the [[principle]] of hesiod, 'potter hates potter,' because they are nearly akin, for the extreme form of [[democracy]] is [[tyranny]]; and royalty and [[aristocracy]] are both alike opposed to [[tyranny]], because they are constitutions [[constitution]] of a different type. and therefore the lacedaemonians put down most of the tyrannies, and so did the syracusans during the [[time]] when they were well governed. 

again, tyrannies are destroyed from within, when the reigning [[family]] are divided among themselves, as that of gelo was, and more recently that of dionysius; in the case of gelo because thrasybulus, the [[brother]] of hiero, flattered the [[son]] of gelo and [[led]] him into excesses in order that he might [[rule]] in his name. whereupon the [[family]] got together a party to get rid of thrasybulus and save the [[tyranny]]; but those of the [[people]] who conspired with them seized the opportunity and drove them all out. in the case of dionysius, dion, his own relative, attacked and expelled him with the assistance of the [[people]]; he afterwards perished himself. 

there are two [[chief]] motives which induce [[men]] to attack tyrannies- [[hatred]] and contempt. [[hatred]] of tyrants [[tyrant]] is inevitable, and contempt is also a frequent cause of their destruction. thus we see that most of those who have acquired, have retained their [[power]], but those who have inherited, have lost it, almost at once; for, living in luxurious ease, they have become contemptible, and offer many opportunities to their assailants. anger, too, must be included under [[hatred]], and produces [[produce]] the same effects. it is often times [[time]] even more ready to strike- the angry are more impetuous in making an attack, for they do not [[follow]] [[rational]] [[principle]]. and [[men]] are very apt to give way to their [[passions]] when they are insulted. to this cause is to be attributed the fall of the peisistratidae and of many others. [[hatred]] is more reasonable, for anger is accompanied by [[pain]], which is an impediment to [[reason]], whereas [[hatred]] is painless. 

in a word, all the causes which i have mentioned as destroying the [[last]] and most unmixed form of [[oligarchy]], and the extreme form of [[democracy]], may be assumed to affect [[tyranny]]; indeed the extreme forms of both are only tyrannies distributed among several persons [[person]]. kingly [[rule]] is little affected by external causes, and is therefore lasting; it is generally destroyed from within. and there are two ways in which the destruction may come about; (1) when the members of the [[royal]] [[family]] quarrel among themselves, and (2) when the kings [[king]] attempt to administer the [[state]] too much after the [[fashion]] of a [[tyranny]], and to extend their [[authority]] contrary to the [[law]]. royalties do not now come into existence; where such forms of [[government]] arise, they are rather monarchies [[monarchy]] or tyrannies. for the [[rule]] of a [[king]] is over voluntary subjects [[subject]], and he is supreme in all important matters; but in our own day [[men]] are more upon an equality, and no one is so immeasurably superior to others as to represent adequately the greatness and [[dignity]] of the office. hence [[mankind]] will not, if they can [[help]], endure it, and any one who obtains [[power]] by [[force]] or fraud is at once [[thought]] to be a [[tyrant]]. in hereditary monarchies [[monarchy]] a further cause of destruction is the [[fact]] that kings [[king]] often fall into contempt, and, although possessing not [[tyrannical]] [[power]], but only [[royal]] [[dignity]], are apt to outrage others. their overthrow is then readily effected; for there is an end to the [[king]] when his subjects [[subject]] do not want to have him, but the [[tyrant]] lasts, whether they like him or not. 

the destruction of monarchies [[monarchy]] is to be attributed to these and the like causes. 

part xi 

and they are preserved, to speak generally, by the opposite causes; or, if we consider them separately, (1) royalty is preserved by the limitation of its powers [[power]]. the more restricted the functions of kings [[king]], the longer their [[power]] will [[last]] unimpaired; for then they are more moderate and not so despotic in their ways; and they are less envied by their subjects [[subject]]. this is the [[reason]] why the kingly office has lasted so long among the molossians. and for a similar [[reason]] it has continued among the lacedaemonians, because there it was always divided between two, and afterwards further limited by theopompus in various respects [[respect]], more particularly by the establishment of the ephoralty. he diminished the [[power]] of the kings [[king]], but established on a more lasting basis the kingly office, which was thus made in a [[certain]] sense not less, but greater. there is a story that when his [[wife]] once [[asked]] him whether he was not ashamed to leave to his sons [[son]] a [[royal]] [[power]] which was less than he had inherited from his [[father]], 'no indeed,' he replied, 'for the [[power]] which i leave to them will be more lasting.' 

as to (2) tyrannies, they are preserved in two most opposite ways. one of them is the old traditional method in which most tyrants [[tyrant]] administer their [[government]]. of such [[arts]] periander of corinth is said to have been the [[great]] master, and many similar devices may be gathered from the persians in the administration of their [[government]]. there are firstly the prescriptions mentioned some distance back, for the preservation of a [[tyranny]], in so far as this is possible; viz., that the [[tyrant]] should lop off those who are too high; he must put to [[death]] [[men]] of spirit; he must not allow [[common]] meals, clubs, [[education]], and the like; he must be upon his guard against anything which is likely to inspire either [[courage]] or confidence among his subjects [[subject]]; he must prohibit literary assemblies or other meetings for discussion, and he must take every means to prevent [[people]] from knowing one another (for acquaintance begets mutual confidence). further, he must compel all persons [[person]] staying in the [[city]] to appear in [[public]] and [[live]] at his gates; then he will [[know]] what they are doing: if they are always kept under, they will learn to be humble. in short, he should practice these and the like persian and barbaric [[arts]], which all have the same object. a [[tyrant]] should also endeavor to [[know]] what each of his subjects [[subject]] says or does, and should employ spies, like the 'female detectives' at syracuse, and the eavesdroppers whom hiero was in the habit of sending to any place of resort or meeting; for the [[fear]] of informers prevents [[people]] from speaking their minds [[mind]], and if they do, they are more easily found out. another art [[arts]] of the [[tyrant]] is to sow quarrels among the [[citizens]]; [[friends]] should be embroiled with [[friends]], the [[people]] with the notables, and the [[rich]] with one another. also he should impoverish his subjects [[subject]]; he thus provides against the maintenance of a guard by the citizen and the [[people]], having to keep hard at [[work]], are prevented from conspiring. the pyramids of [[egypt]] afford an [[example]] of this policy; also the offerings of the [[family]] of cypselus, and the building of the temple of olympian [[zeus]] by the peisistratidae, and the [[great]] polycratean monuments at samos; all these works [[work]] were alike intended to occupy the [[people]] and keep them [[poor]]. another practice of tyrants [[tyrant]] is to multiply taxes, after the manner of dionysius at syracuse, who contrived that within five years his subjects [[subject]] should bring into the treasury their whole [[property]]. the [[tyrant]] is also fond of making [[war]] in order that his subjects [[subject]] may have something to do and be always in want of a leader. and whereas the [[power]] of a [[king]] is preserved by his [[friends]], the characteristic of a [[tyrant]] is to distrust his [[friends]], because he knows [[know]] that all [[men]] want to overthrow him, and they above all have the [[power]]. 

again, the [[evil]] practices of the [[last]] and worst form of [[democracy]] are all found in tyrannies. such are the [[power]] given to [[women]] in their families [[family]] in the [[hope]] that they will inform against their husbands, and the license which is allowed to slaves [[slave]] in order that they may betray their masters; for slaves [[slave]] and [[women]] do not conspire against tyrants [[tyrant]]; and they are of course friendly to tyrannies and also to democracies [[democracy]], since under them they have a [[good]] [[time]]. for the [[people]] too would fain be a monarch, and therefore by them, as well as by the [[tyrant]], the flatterer is held in [[honor]]; in democracies [[democracy]] he is the demagogue; and the [[tyrant]] also has those who associate with him in a humble spirit, which is a [[work]] of [[flattery]]. 

hence tyrants [[tyrant]] are always fond of [[bad]] [[men]], because they [[love]] to be flattered, but no [[man]] who has the spirit of a freeman in him will lower himself by [[flattery]]; [[good]] [[men]] [[love]] others, or at any rate do not flatter them. moreover, the [[bad]] are useful for [[bad]] purposes [[purpose]]; 'nail knocks out nail,' as the proverb says. it is characteristic of a [[tyrant]] to dislike every one who has [[dignity]] or independence; he wants to be alone in his [[glory]], but any one who claims a like [[dignity]] or asserts his independence encroaches upon his prerogative, and is hated by him as an [[enemy]] to his [[power]]. another mark of a [[tyrant]] is that he likes foreigners [[better]] than [[citizens]], and lives [[life]] with them and invites them to his table; for the one are enemies [[enemy]], but the others enter into no rivalry with him. 

such are the notes of the [[tyrant]] and the [[arts]] by which he preserves his [[power]]; there is no wickedness too [[great]] for him. all that we have said may be summed up under three heads, which [[answer]] to the three aims of the [[tyrant]]. these are, (1) the humiliation of his subjects [[subject]]; he knows [[know]] that a mean-spirited [[man]] will not conspire against anybody; (2) the creation of mistrust among them; for a [[tyrant]] is not overthrown until [[men]] begin to have confidence in one another; and this is the [[reason]] why tyrants [[tyrant]] are at [[war]] with the [[good]]; they are under the [[idea]] that their [[power]] is endangered by them, not only because they would not be ruled despotically but also because they are [[loyal]] to one another, and to other [[men]], and do not inform against one another or against other [[men]]; (3) the [[tyrant]] desires [[desire]] that his subjects [[subject]] shall be incapable of action, for no one attempts what is impossible, and they will not attempt to overthrow a [[tyranny]], if they are powerless. under these three heads the whole policy of a [[tyrant]] may be summed up, and to one or other of them all his ideas [[idea]] may be referred: (1) he sows distrust among his subjects [[subject]]; (2) he takes away their [[power]]; (3) he humbles them. 

this then is one of the two methods by which tyrannies are preserved; and there is another which proceeds upon an almost opposite [[principle]] of action. the [[nature]] of this latter method may be gathered from a comparison of the causes which [[destroy]] kingdoms [[kingdom]], for as one mode of destroying kingly [[power]] is to make the office of [[king]] more [[tyrannical]], so the salvation of a [[tyranny]] is to make it more like the [[rule]] of a [[king]]. but of one thing the [[tyrant]] must be careful; he must keep [[power]] enough to [[rule]] over his subjects [[subject]], whether they like him or not, for if he once gives this up he gives up his [[tyranny]]. but though [[power]] must be retained as the foundation, in all else the [[tyrant]] should act or appear to act in the [[character]] of a [[king]]. in the first place he should pretend a [[care]] of the [[public]] revenues [[revenue]], and not waste [[money]] in making presents [[present]] of a sort at which the [[common]] [[people]] get excited when they see their hard-won earnings snatched from them and lavished on courtesans and strangers and artists. he should give an account of what he receives and of what he spends (a practice which has been adopted by some tyrants); for then he will seem to be a steward of the [[public]] rather than a [[tyrant]]; nor need he [[fear]] that, while he is the [[lord]] of the [[city]], he will ever be in want of [[money]]. such a policy is at all events much more advantageous for the [[tyrant]] when he goes from [[home]], than to leave behind him a hoard, for then the garrison who remain in the [[city]] will be less likely to attack his [[power]]; and a [[tyrant]], when he is absent from [[home]], has more [[reason]] to [[fear]] the guardians of his treasure than the [[citizens]], for the one accompany him, but the others remain behind. in the second place, he should be seen to collect taxes and to require [[public]] services only for [[state]] purposes [[purpose]], and that he may form a fund in case of [[war]], and generally he ought to make himself the guardian and treasurer of them, as if they belonged, not to him, but to the [[public]]. he should appear, not harsh, but dignified, and when [[men]] meet him they should look upon him with reverence, and not with [[fear]]. yet it is hard for him to be respected if he inspires no [[respect]], and therefore whatever virtues [[virtue]] he may neglect, at least he should maintain the [[character]] of a [[great]] soldier, and [[produce]] the impression that he is one. neither he nor any of his associates should ever be guilty of the least offense against modesty towards the [[young]] of either [[sex]] who are his subjects [[subject]], and the [[women]] of his [[family]] should observe a like self-control towards other [[women]]; the insolence of [[women]] has ruined many tyrannies. in the indulgence of pleasures [[pleasure]] he should be the opposite of our [[modern]] tyrants [[tyrant]], who not only begin at dawn and pass whole days in sensuality, but want other [[men]] to see them, that they may [[admire]] their [[happy]] and blessed lot. in these things a [[tyrant]] should if possible be moderate, or at any rate should not parade his vices [[vice]] to the [[world]]; for a drunken and drowsy [[tyrant]] is soon despised and attacked; not so he who is temperate and wide awake. his conduct should be the very reverse of nearly everything which has been said before about tyrants [[tyrant]]. he ought to adorn and improve his [[city]], as though he were not a [[tyrant]], but the guardian of the [[state]]. also he should appear to be particularly earnest in the service of the gods; for if [[men]] [[think]] that a ruler is [[religious]] and has a reverence for the gods, they are less afraid of suffering [[injustice]] at his hands, and they are less disposed to conspire against him, because they [[believe]] him to have the very gods fighting on his side. at the same [[time]] his [[religion]] must not be [[thought]] foolish. and he should [[honor]] [[men]] of [[merit]], and make them [[think]] that they would not be held in more [[honor]] by the [[citizens]] if they had a [[free]] [[government]]. the [[honor]] he should distribute himself, but the [[punishment]] should be inflicted by officers and courts of [[law]]. it is a precaution which is taken by all monarchs not to make one [[person]] [[great]]; but if one, then two or more should be raised, that they may look sharply after one another. if after all some one has to be made [[great]], he should not be a [[man]] of bold spirit; for such dispositions are ever most inclined to strike. and if any one is to be deprived of his [[power]], let it b

we have now considered the varieties of the deliberative or supreme [[power]] in states, and the various arrangements of law-courts and [[state]] offices, and which of them are adapted to different forms of [[government]]. we have also spoken of the destruction and preservation of constitutions [[constitution]], how and from what causes they arise. 

of [[democracy]] and all other forms of [[government]] there are many kinds [[kind]]; and it will be well to assign to them severally the modes of organization which are proper and advantageous to each, adding what remains to be said about them. moreover, we ought to consider the various combinations of these modes themselves; for such combinations make constitutions [[constitution]] overlap one another, so that aristocracies have an oligarchical [[character]], and constitutional governments [[government]] incline to democracies [[democracy]]. 

when i speak of the combinations which remain to be considered, and thus far have not been considered by us, i mean such as these: when the deliberative part of the [[government]] and the election of officers is constituted oligarchically, and the law-courts aristocratically, or when the courts and the deliberative part of the [[state]] are oligarchical, and the election to office aristocratical, or when in any other way there is a want of harmony in the composition of a [[state]]. 

i have shown already what forms of [[democracy]] are suited to particular cities [[city]], and what of [[oligarchy]] to particular peoples [[people]], and to whom each of the other forms of [[government]] is suited. further, we must not only show which of these governments [[government]] is the [[best]] for each [[state]], but also briefly proceed to consider how these and other forms of [[government]] are to be established. 

first of all let us speak of [[democracy]], which will also bring to [[light]] the opposite form of [[government]] commonly called [[oligarchy]]. for the purposes [[purpose]] of this inquiry we need to ascertain all the elements and characteristics of [[democracy]], since from the combinations of these the varieties of democratic [[government]] arise. there are several of these differing from each other, and the difference is due to two causes. one (1) has been already mentioned- differences of [[population]]; for the popular element may consist of husbandmen, or of mechanics, or of laborers, and if the first of these be added to the second, or the third to the two others, not only does the [[democracy]] become [[better]] or worse, but its very [[nature]] is changed. a second cause (2) remains to be mentioned: the various properties [[property]] and characteristics of [[democracy]], when variously combined, make a difference. for one [[democracy]] will have less and another will have more, and another will have all of these characteristics. there is an advantage in knowing them all, whether a [[man]] wishes [[wish]] to establish some new form of [[democracy]], or only to remodel an existing one. founders of states try to bring together all the elements which accord with the ideas [[idea]] of the several constitutions [[constitution]]; but this is a mistake of theirs, as i have already remarked when speaking of the destruction and preservation of states. we will now set forth the principles [[principle]], characteristics, and aims of such states. 

part ii 

the basis of a democratic [[state]] is [[liberty]]; which, according to the [[common]] [[opinion]] of [[men]], can only be enjoyed in such a [[state]]; this they affirm to be the [[great]] end of every [[democracy]]. one [[principle]] of [[liberty]] is for all to [[rule]] and be ruled in turn, and indeed democratic [[justice]] is the application of numerical not proportionate equality; whence it follows that the majority must be supreme, and that whatever the majority approve must be the end and the just. every citizen, it is said, must have equality, and therefore in a [[democracy]] the [[poor]] have more [[power]] than the [[rich]], because there are more of them, and the will of the majority is supreme. this, then, is one note of [[liberty]] which all democrats affirm to be the [[principle]] of their [[state]]. another is that a [[man]] should [[live]] as he likes. this, they say, is the [[privilege]] of a freeman, since, on the other hand, not to [[live]] as a [[man]] likes is the mark of a [[slave]]. this is the second characteristic of [[democracy]], whence has arisen the claim of [[men]] to be ruled by none, if possible, or, if this is impossible, to [[rule]] and be ruled in turns; and so it contributes to the [[freedom]] based upon equality. 

such being our foundation and such the [[principle]] from which we start, the characteristics of [[democracy]] are as follows the election of officers by all out of all; and that all should [[rule]] over each, and each in his turn over all; that the appointment to all offices, or to all but those which require [[experience]] and [[skill]], should be made by lot; that no [[property]] qualification should be required for offices, or only a very low one; that a [[man]] should not hold the same office twice, or not often, or in the case of few except [[military]] offices: that the tenure of all offices, or of as many as possible, should be brief, that all [[men]] should sit in [[judgment]], or that judges [[judge]] selected out of all should [[judge]], in all matters, or in most and in the [[greatest]] and most important- such as the scrutiny of accounts, the [[constitution]], and private contracts; that the assembly should be supreme over all causes, or at any rate over the most important, and the magistrates over none or only over a very few. of all magistracies, a council is the most democratic when there is not the means of paying all the [[citizens]], but when they are paid even this is robbed of its [[power]]; for the [[people]] then draw all cases to themselves, as i said in the previous discussion. the next characteristic of [[democracy]] is payment for services; assembly, [[law]] courts, magistrates, everybody receives [[pay]], when it is to be had; or when it is not to be had for all, then it is given to the law-courts and to the stated assemblies, to the council and to the magistrates, or at least to any of them who are compelled to have their meals together. and whereas [[oligarchy]] is characterized by birth, [[wealth]], and [[education]], the notes of [[democracy]] appear to be the opposite of these- low birth, [[poverty]], mean employment. another note is that no magistracy is perpetual, but if any such have survived some ancient [[change]] in the [[constitution]] it should be stripped of its [[power]], and the holders should be elected by lot and no longer by vote. these are the points [[common]] to all democracies [[democracy]]; but [[democracy]] and demos in their truest form are based upon the recognized [[principle]] of democratic [[justice]], that all should count equally; for equality implies that the [[poor]] should have no more share in the [[government]] than the [[rich]], and should not be the only rulers, but that all should [[rule]] equally according to their numbers. and in this way [[men]] [[think]] that they will secure equality and [[freedom]] in their [[state]]. 

part iii 

next comes the [[question]], how is this equality to be obtained? are we to assign to a thousand [[poor]] [[men]] the [[property]] qualifications of five hundred [[rich]] [[men]]? and shall we give the thousand a [[power]] [[equal]] to that of the five hundred? or, if this is not to be the mode, ought we, still retaining the same ratio, to take [[equal]] numbers from each and give them the control of the elections and of the courts?- which, according to the democratical notion, is the juster form of the constitution- this or one based on numbers only? democrats say that [[justice]] is that to which the majority agree, oligarchs that to which the wealthier class; in their [[opinion]] the decision should be given according to the amount of [[property]]. in both principles [[principle]] there is some inequality and [[injustice]]. for if [[justice]] is the will of the few, any one [[person]] who has more [[wealth]] than all the rest of the [[rich]] put together, ought, upon the oligarchical [[principle]], to have the sole power- but this would be [[tyranny]]; or if [[justice]] is the will of the majority, as i was before saying, they will unjustly confiscate the [[property]] of the wealthy minority. to find a [[principle]] of equality which they both agree we must inquire into their respective ideas [[idea]] of [[justice]]. 

now they agree in saying that whatever is decided by the majority of the [[citizens]] is to be deemed [[law]]. granted: but not without some reserve; since there are two classes out of which a [[state]] is composed- the [[poor]] and the rich- that is to be deemed [[law]], on which both or the greater part of both agree; and if they disagree, that which is approved by the greater number, and by those who have the higher qualification. for [[example]], suppose that there are ten [[rich]] and twenty [[poor]], and some measure is approved by six of the [[rich]] and is disapproved by fifteen of the [[poor]], and the remaining four of the [[rich]] join with the party of the [[poor]], and the remaining five of the [[poor]] with that of the [[rich]]; in such a case the will of those whose qualifications, when both sides are added up, are the [[greatest]], should prevail. if they turn out to be [[equal]], there is no greater difficulty than at [[present]], when, if the assembly or the courts are divided, recourse is had to the lot, or to some similar expedient. but, although it may be difficult in theory to [[know]] what is just and [[equal]], the practical difficulty of inducing those to forbear who can, if they like, encroach, is far greater, for the weaker are always asking for equality and [[justice]], but the stronger [[care]] for none of these things. 

part iv 

of the four kinds [[kind]] of [[democracy]], as was said in the in the previous discussion, the [[best]] is that which comes first in order; it is also the oldest of them all. i am speaking of them according to the [[natural]] classification of their inhabitants. for the [[best]] material of [[democracy]] is an agricultural [[population]]; there is no difficulty in forming a [[democracy]] where the mass of the [[people]] [[live]] by agriculture or tending of cattle. being [[poor]], they have no leisure, and therefore do not often attend the assembly, and not having the necessaries of [[life]] they are always at [[work]], and do not covet the [[property]] of others. indeed, they find their employment pleasanter than the cares [[care]] of [[government]] or office where no [[great]] gains can be made out of them, for the many are more desirous of gain than of [[honor]]. a proof is that even the ancient tyrannies were patiently endured by them, as they still endure oligarchies, if they are allowed to [[work]] and are not deprived of their [[property]]; for some of them grow quickly [[rich]] and the others are well enough off. moreover, they have the [[power]] of electing the magistrates and calling them to account; their [[ambition]], if they have any, is thus satisfied; and in some democracies [[democracy]], although they do not all share in the appointment of offices, except through representatives elected in turn out of the whole [[people]], as at mantinea; yet, if they have the [[power]] of deliberating, the many are contented. even this form of [[government]] may be regarded as a [[democracy]], and was such at mantinea. hence it is both expedient and customary in the aforementioned type of [[democracy]] that all should elect to offices, and conduct scrutinies, and sit in the law-courts, but that the [[great]] offices should be filled up by election and from persons [[person]] having a qualification; the greater requiring a greater qualification, or, if there be no offices for which a qualification is required, then those who are marked out by special ability should be appointed. under such a form of [[government]] the [[citizens]] are sure to be governed well (for the offices will always be held by the [[best]] persons [[person]]; the [[people]] are willing enough to elect them and are not [[jealous]] of the good). the [[good]] and the notables will then be satisfied, for they will not be governed by [[men]] who are their inferiors, and the persons [[person]] elected will [[rule]] justly, because others will call them to account. every [[man]] should be responsible to others, nor should any one be allowed to do just as he pleases; for where absolute [[freedom]] is allowed, there is nothing to restrain the [[evil]] which is inherent in every [[man]]. but the [[principle]] of responsibility secures that which is the [[greatest]] [[good]] in states; the [[right]] persons [[person]] [[rule]] and are prevented from doing [[wrong]], and the [[people]] have their due. it is evident that this is the [[best]] [[kind]] of [[democracy]], and why? because the [[people]] are drawn from a [[certain]] class. some of the ancient laws [[law]] of most states were, all of them, useful with a view to making the [[people]] husbandmen. they provided either that no one should possess more than a [[certain]] quantity of [[land]], or that, if he did, the [[land]] should not be within a [[certain]] distance from the town or the acropolis. formerly in many states there was a [[law]] forbidding any one to sell his original allotment of [[land]]. there is a similar [[law]] attributed to oxylus, which is to the effect that there should be a [[certain]] portion of every man's [[man]] [[land]] on which he could not borrow [[money]]. a useful corrective to the [[evil]] of which i am speaking would be the [[law]] of the aphytaeans, who, although they are numerous, and do not possess much [[land]], are all of them husbandmen. for their properties [[property]] are reckoned in the census; not entire, but only in such small portions that even the [[poor]] may have more than the amount required. 

next [[best]] to an agricultural, and in many respects [[respect]] similar, are a pastoral [[people]], who [[live]] by their flocks; they are the [[best]] trained of any for [[war]], robust in [[body]] and able to camp out. the [[people]] of whom other democracies [[democracy]] consist are far inferior to them, for their [[life]] is inferior; there is no room for [[moral]] excellence in any of their employments, whether they be mechanics or traders or laborers. besides, [[people]] of this class can readily come to the assembly, because they are continually moving about in the [[city]] and in the agora; whereas husbandmen are scattered over the [[country]] and do not meet, or equally [[feel]] the want of assembling together. where the territory also happens to extend to a distance from the [[city]], there is no difficulty in making an excellent [[democracy]] or constitutional [[government]]; for the [[people]] are compelled to settle in the [[country]], and even if there is a town [[population]] the assembly ought not to meet, in democracies [[democracy]], when the [[country]] [[people]] cannot come. we have thus explained how the first and [[best]] form of [[democracy]] should be constituted; it is clear that the other or inferior sorts will deviate in a regular order, and the [[population]] which is excluded will at each stage be of a lower [[kind]]. 

the [[last]] form of [[democracy]], that in which all share alike, is one which cannot be borne by all states, and will not [[last]] long unless well regulated by laws [[law]] and customs. the more general causes which tend to [[destroy]] this or other kinds [[kind]] of [[government]] have been pretty fully considered. in order to constitute such a [[democracy]] and strengthen the [[people]], the leaders have been in the habit including as many as they can, and making [[citizens]] not only of those who are legitimate, but even of the illegitimate, and of those who have only one parent a citizen, whether [[father]] or [[mother]]; for nothing of this sort comes amiss to such a [[democracy]]. this is the way in which demagogues proceed. whereas the [[right]] thing would be to make no more additions when the number of the commonalty exceeds that of the notables and of the middle class- beyond this not to go. when in excess of this point, the [[constitution]] becomes disorderly, and the notables grow excited and impatient of the [[democracy]], as in the insurrection at cyrene; for no notice is taken of a little [[evil]], but when it increases it strikes the eye. measures like those which cleisthenes passed when he wanted to increase the [[power]] of the [[democracy]] at [[athens]], or such as were taken by the founders of popular [[government]] at cyrene, are useful in the extreme form of [[democracy]]. fresh tribes and brotherhoods should be established; the private rites of families [[family]] should be restricted and converted into [[public]] ones; in short, every contrivance should be adopted which will mingle the [[citizens]] with one another and get rid of old connections. again, the measures which are taken by tyrants [[tyrant]] appear all of them to be democratic; such, for instance, as the license permitted to slaves [[slave]] (which may be to a [[certain]] extent advantageous) and also that of [[women]] and [[children]], and the aflowing everybody to [[live]] as he likes. such a [[government]] will have many supporters, for most persons [[person]] would rather [[live]] in a disorderly than in a sober manner. 

part v 

the mere establishment of a [[democracy]] is not the only or principal [[business]] of the legislator, or of those who [[wish]] to create such a [[state]], for any [[state]], however badly constituted, may [[last]] one, two, or three days; a far greater difficulty is the preservation of it. the legislator should therefore endeavor to have a firm foundation according to the principles [[principle]] already laid down concerning the preservation and destruction of states; he should guard against the destructive elements, and should make laws [[law]], whether written or unwritten, which will contain all the preservatives of states. he must not [[think]] the truly democratical or oligarchical measure to be that which will give the [[greatest]] amount of [[democracy]] or [[oligarchy]], but that which will make them [[last]] longest. the demagogues of our own day often get [[property]] confiscated in the law-courts in order to please the [[people]]. but those who have the welfare of the [[state]] at [[heart]] should counteract them, and make a [[law]] that the [[property]] of the condemned should not be [[public]] and go into the treasury but be [[sacred]]. thus offenders will be as much afraid, for they will be punished all the same, and the [[people]], having nothing to gain, will not be so ready to condemn the accused. [[care]] should also be taken that [[state]] trials are as few as possible, and heavy penalties should be inflicted on those who bring groundless accusations; for it is the practice to indict, not members of the popular party, but the notables, although the [[citizens]] ought to be all attached to the [[constitution]] as well, or at any rate should not regard their rulers as enemies [[enemy]]. 

now, since in the [[last]] and worst form of [[democracy]] the [[citizens]] are very numerous, and can hardly be made to assemble unless they are paid, and to [[pay]] them when there are no revenues [[revenue]] presses hardly upon the notables (for the [[money]] must be obtained by a [[property]] tax and confiscations and [[corrupt]] practices of the courts, things which have before now overthrown many democracies); where, i say, there are no revenues [[revenue]], the [[government]] should hold few assemblies, and the law-courts should consist of many persons [[person]], but sit for a few days only. this [[system]] has two advantages: first, the [[rich]] do not [[fear]] the expense, even although they are unpaid themselves when the [[poor]] are paid; and secondly, causes are [[better]] tried, for wealthy persons [[person]], although they do not like to be long absent from their own affairs, do not [[mind]] going for a few days to the law-courts. where there are revenues [[revenue]] the demagogues should not be allowed after their manner to distribute the surplus; the [[poor]] are always receiving and always wanting more and more, for such [[help]] is like water poured into a leaky cask. yet the true friend of the [[people]] should see that they be not too [[poor]], for extreme [[poverty]] lowers the [[character]] of the [[democracy]]; measures therefore should be taken which will give them lasting [[prosperity]]; and as this is equally the interest of all classes, the proceeds of the [[public]] revenues [[revenue]] should be accumulated and distributed among its [[poor]], if possible, in such quantities as may enable them to purchase a little farm, or, at any rate, make a beginning in [[trade]] or husbandry. and if this benevolence cannot be extended to all, [[money]] should be distributed in turn according to tribes or other divisions, and in the meantime the [[rich]] should [[pay]] the fee for the attendance of the [[poor]] at the necessary assemblies; and should in return be excused from useless [[public]] services. by administering the [[state]] in this spirit the carthaginians retain the affections of the [[people]]; their policy is from [[time]] to [[time]] to send some of them into their dependent towns, where they grow [[rich]]. it is also worthy of a generous and sensible nobility to divide the [[poor]] amongst them, and give them the means of going to [[work]]. the [[example]] of the [[people]] of tarentum is also well deserving of imitation, for, by sharing the use of their own [[property]] with the [[poor]], they gain their [[good]] will. moreover, they divide all their offices into two classes, some of them being elected by vote, the others by lot; the latter, that the [[people]] may participate in them, and the former, that the [[state]] may be [[better]] administered. a like result may be gained by dividing the same offices, so as to have two classes of magistrates, one chosen by vote, the other by lot. 

enough has been said of the manner in which democracies [[democracy]] ought to be constituted. 

part vi 

from these considerations there will be no difficulty in seeing what should be the [[constitution]] of oligarchies. we have only to [[reason]] from opposites and compare each form of [[oligarchy]] with the corresponding form of [[democracy]]. 

the first and [[best]] attempered of oligarchies is akin to a constitutional [[government]]. in this there ought to be two standards of qualification; the one high, the other low- the lower qualifying for the humbler yet indispensable offices and the higher for the superior ones. he who acquires the prescribed qualification should have the rights [[right]] of citizenship. the number of those admitted should be such as will make the entire governing [[body]] stronger than those who are excluded, and the new citizen should be always taken out of the [[better]] class of the [[people]]. the [[principle]], narrowed a little, gives another form of [[oligarchy]]; until at length we reach the most cliquish and [[tyrannical]] of them all, answering to the extreme [[democracy]], which, being the worst, requires vigilance in proportion to its badness. for as healthy bodies [[body]] and ships well provided with sailors may undergo many mishaps and survive them, whereas sickly constitutions [[constitution]] and rotten ill-manned ships are ruined by the very least mistake, so do the worst forms of [[government]] require the [[greatest]] [[care]]. the populousness of democracies [[democracy]] generally preserves them (for e [[state]] need not be much increased,since there is no necessity tha number is to [[democracy]] in the place of [[justice]] based on proportion); whereas the preservation of an [[oligarchy]] clearly depends on an opposite [[principle]], viz., [[good]] order. 

part vii 

as there are four [[chief]] divisions of the [[common]] people- husbandmen, mechanics, retail traders, laborers; so also there are four kinds [[kind]] of [[military]] forces- the cavalry, the heavy infantry, the [[light]] armed [[troops]], the navy. when the [[country]] is adapted for cavalry, then a [[strong]] [[oligarchy]] is likely to be established. for the security of the inhabitants depends upon a [[force]] of this sort, and only [[rich]] [[men]] can afford to keep horses. the second form of [[oligarchy]] prevails when the [[country]] is adapted to heavy infantry; for this service is [[better]] suited to the [[rich]] than to the [[poor]]. but the light-armed and the naval element are wholly democratic; and nowadays, where they are numerous, if the two parties quarrel, the [[oligarchy]] are often worsted by them in the struggle. a remedy for this [[state]] of things may be found in the practice of generals who combine a proper contingent of light-armed [[troops]] with cavalry and heavy-armed. and this is the way in which the [[poor]] get the [[better]] of the [[rich]] in civil contests; being lightly armed, they [[fight]] with advantage against cavalry and heavy being lightly armed, they [[fight]] with advantage against cavalry and heavy infantry. an [[oligarchy]] which raises such a [[force]] out of the lower classes raises a [[power]] against itself. and therefore, since the ages [[age]] of the [[citizens]] vary and some are older and some younger, the fathers [[father]] should have their own sons [[son]], while they are still [[young]], taught the agile movements of light-armed [[troops]]; and these, when they have been taken out of the ranks of the [[youth]], should become light-armed warriors in reality. the [[oligarchy]] should also yield a share in the [[government]] to the [[people]], either, as i said before, to those who have a [[property]] qualification, or, as in the case of thebes, to those who have abstained for a [[certain]] number of years from mean employments, or, as at massalia, to [[men]] of [[merit]] who are selected for their worthiness, whether previously [[citizens]] or not. the magistracies of the highest rank, which ought to be in the hands of the governing [[body]], should have expensive duties [[duty]] attached to them, and then the [[people]] will not [[desire]] them and will take no offense at the privileges [[privilege]] of their rulers when they see that they [[pay]] a heavy fine for their [[dignity]]. it is fitting also that the magistrates on entering office should offer magnificent sacrifices [[sacrifice]] or erect some [[public]] edifice, and then the [[people]] who participate in the entertainments, and see the [[city]] decorated with votive offerings and buildings, will not [[desire]] an alteration in the [[government]], and the notables will have memorials of their munificence. this, however, is anything but the [[fashion]] of our [[modern]] oligarchs, who are as covetous of gain as they are of [[honor]]; oligarchies like theirs may be well described as petty democracies [[democracy]]. enough of the manner in which democracies [[democracy]] and oligarchies should be organized. 

part viii 

next in order follows the [[right]] distribution of offices, their number, their [[nature]], their duties [[duty]], of which indeed we have already spoken. no [[state]] can [[exist]] not having the necessary offices, and no [[state]] can be well administered not having the offices which tend to preserve harmony and [[good]] order. in small states, as we have already remarked, there must not be many of them, but in larger there must be a larger number, and we should carefully consider which offices may properly be [[united]] and which separated. 

first among necessary offices is that which has the [[care]] of the market; a magistrate should be appointed to inspect contracts and to maintain order. for in every [[state]] there must inevitably be buyers and sellers who will supply one another's wants; this is the readiest way to make a [[state]] self-sufficing and so fulfill the [[purpose]] for which [[men]] come together into one [[state]]. a second office of a similar [[kind]] undertakes the supervision and embellishment of [[public]] and private buildings, the maintaining and repairing of houses and roads, the prevention of disputes about boundaries, and other concerns of a like [[nature]]. this is commonly called the office of [[city]] warden, and has various departments, which, in more populous towns, are shared among different persons [[person]], one, for [[example]], taking charge of the walls, another of the fountains, a third of harbors. there is another equally necessary office, and of a similar [[kind]], having to do with the same matters without the walls and in the country- the magistrates who hold this office are called wardens of the [[country]], or inspectors of the woods. besides these three there is a fourth office of receivers of taxes, who have under their charge the [[revenue]] which is distributed among the various departments; these are called receivers or treasurers. another officer registers all private contracts, and decisions of the courts, all [[public]] indictments, and also all preliminary proceedings. this office again is sometimes subdivided, in which case one officer is appointed over all the rest. these officers are called recorders or [[sacred]] recorders, presidents, and the like. 

next to these comes an office of which the duties [[duty]] are the most necessary and also the most difficult, viz., that to which is committed the execution of punishments [[punishment]], or the exaction of fines from those who are posted up according to the registers; and also the custody of prisoners [[prisoner]]. the difficulty of this office arises out of the odium which is attached to it; no one will undertake it unless [[great]] profits [[profit]] are to be made, and any one who does is loath to execute the [[law]]. still the office is necessary; for judicial decisions are useless if they take no effect; and if [[society]] cannot [[exist]] without them, neither can it [[exist]] without the execution of them. it is an office which, being so unpopular, should not be entrusted to one [[person]], but divided among several taken from different courts. in like manner an effort should be made to distribute among different persons [[person]] the writing up of those who are on the register of [[public]] debtors. some sentences should be executed by the magistrates also, and in particular penalties due to the outgoing magistrates should be exacted by the incoming ones; and as regards those due to magistrates already in office, when one court has given judgement, another should exact the penalty; for [[example]], the wardens of the [[city]] should exact the fines imposed by the wardens of the agora, and others again should exact the fines imposed by them. for penalties are more likely to be exacted when less odium attaches to the exaction of them; but a double odium is incurred when the judges [[judge]] who have passed also execute the sentence, and if they are always the executioners, they will be the enemies [[enemy]] of all. 

in many places, while one magistracy executes the sentence, another has the custody of the prisoners [[prisoner]], as, for [[example]], 'the eleven' at [[athens]]. it is well to separate off the jailorship also, and try by some device to render the office less unpopular. for it is quite as necessary as that of the executioners; but [[good]] [[men]] do all they can to avoid it, and worthless persons [[person]] cannot safely be trusted with it; for they themselves require a guard, and are not fit to guard others. there ought not therefore to be a [[single]] or permanent officer set apart for this [[duty]]; but it should be entrusted to the [[young]], wherever they are organized into a band or guard, and different magistrates acting in turn should take charge of it. 

these are the indispensable officers, and should be ranked first; next in order [[follow]] others, equally necessary, but of higher rank, and requiring [[great]] [[experience]] and fidelity. such are the officers to which are committed the guard of the [[city]], and other [[military]] functions. not only in [[time]] of [[war]] but of [[peace]] their [[duty]] will be to defend the walls and gates, and to muster and marshal the [[citizens]]. in some states there are many such offices; in others there are a few only, while small states are content with one; these officers are called generals or commanders. again, if a [[state]] has cavalry or light-armed [[troops]] or archers or a naval [[force]], it will sometimes happen that each of these departments has separate officers, who are called admirals, or generals of cavalry or of light-armed [[troops]]. and there are subordinate officers called naval captains, and captains of light-armed [[troops]] and of horse; having others under them: all these are included in the department of [[war]]. thus much of [[military]] command. 

but since many, not to say all, of these offices handle the [[public]] [[money]], there must of necessity be another office which examines and audits them, and has no other functions. such officers are called by various names- scrutineers, auditors, accountants, controllers. besides all these offices there is another which is supreme over them, and to this is often entrusted both the introduction and the ratification of measures, or at all events it presides, in a [[democracy]], over the assembly. for there must be a [[body]] which convenes the supreme [[authority]] in the [[state]]. in some places they are called 'probuli,' because they hold previous deliberations, but in a [[democracy]] more commonly 'councillors.' these are the [[chief]] [[political]] offices. 

another set of officers is concerned with the maintenance of [[religion]] priests [[priest]] and guardians see to the preservation and repair of the temples of the gods and to other matters of [[religion]]. one office of this sort may be enough in small places, but in larger ones there are a [[great]] many besides the priesthood; for [[example]], superintendents of [[public]] [[worship]], guardians of shrines, treasurers of the [[sacred]] revenues [[revenue]]. nearly connected with these there are also the officers appointed for the performance of the [[public]] sacrifices [[sacrifice]], except any which the [[law]] assigns to the priests [[priest]]; such sacrifices [[sacrifice]] derive their [[dignity]] from the [[public]] hearth of the [[city]]. they are sometimes called archons, sometimes kings [[king]], and sometimes prytanes. 

these, then, are the necessary offices, which may be summed up as follows: offices concerned with matters of [[religion]], with [[war]], with the [[revenue]] and expenditure, with the market, with the [[city]], with the harbors, with the [[country]]; also with the courts of [[law]], with the records of contracts, with execution of sentences, with custody of prisoners [[prisoner]], with audits and scrutinies and accounts of magistrates; lastly, there are those which preside over the [[public]] deliberations of the [[state]]. there are likewise magistracies characteristic of states which are peaceful and prosperous, and at the same [[time]] have a regard to [[good]] order: such as the offices of guardians of [[women]], guardians of the [[law]], guardians of [[children]], and directors of gymnastics; also superintendents of gymnastic and dionysiac contests, and of other similar spectacles. some of these are clearly not democratic offices; for [[example]], the guardianships of [[women]] and children- the [[poor]], not having any slaves [[slave]], must employ both their [[women]] and [[children]] as servants. 

once more: there are three offices according to whose directions the highest magistrates are chosen in [[certain]] states- guardians of the [[law]], probuli, councillors- of these, the guardians of the [[law]] are an aristocratical, the probuli an oligarchical, the council a democratical institution. enough of the different kinds [[kind]] of offices.

part i 

he who would duly inquire about the [[best]] form of a [[state]] ought first to determine which is the most eligible [[life]]; while this remains uncertain the [[best]] form of the [[state]] must also be uncertain; for, in the [[natural]] order of things, those may be expected to lead the [[best]] [[life]] who are governed in the [[best]] manner of which their circumstances admit. we ought therefore to ascertain, first of all, which is the most generally eligible [[life]], and then whether the same [[life]] is or is not [[best]] for the [[state]] and for individuals [[individual]]. 

assuming that enough has been already said in discussions outside the school concerning the [[best]] [[life]], we will now only repeat what is contained in them. certainly no one will dispute the propriety of that partition of goods [[good]] which separates them into three classes, viz., external goods [[good]], goods [[good]] of the [[body]], and goods [[good]] of the [[soul]], or deny that the [[happy]] [[man]] must have all three. for no one would maintain that he is [[happy]] who has not in him a particle of [[courage]] or temperance or [[justice]] or prudence, who is afraid of every insect which flutters [[past]] him, and will commit any crime, however [[great]], in order to gratify his [[lust]] of meat or drink, who will [[sacrifice]] his dearest friend for the sake of half-a-farthing, and is as feeble and false in [[mind]] as a child or a madman. these propositions are almost universally acknowledged as soon as they are uttered, but [[men]] differ about the [[degree]] or relative superiority of this or that [[good]]. some [[think]] that a very moderate amount of [[virtue]] is enough, but set no limit to their desires [[desire]] of [[wealth]], [[property]], [[power]], [[reputation]], and the like. to whom we reply by an appeal to facts [[fact]], which easily prove that [[mankind]] do not acquire or preserve [[virtue]] by the [[help]] of external goods [[good]], but external goods [[good]] by the [[help]] of [[virtue]], and that [[happiness]], whether consisting in [[pleasure]] or [[virtue]], or both, is more often found with those who are most highly cultivated in their [[mind]] and in their [[character]], and have only a moderate share of external goods [[good]], than among those who possess external goods [[good]] to a useless extent but are deficient in higher qualities; and this is not only matter of [[experience]], but, if reflected upon, will easily appear to be in accordance with [[reason]]. for, whereas external goods [[good]] have a limit, like any other instrument, and all things useful are of such a [[nature]] that where there is too much of them they must either do harm, or at any rate be of no use, to their possessors, every [[good]] of the [[soul]], the greater it is, is also of greater use, if the epithet useful as well as [[noble]] is appropriate to such subjects [[subject]]. no proof is required to show that the [[best]] [[state]] of one thing in relation to another corresponds in [[degree]] of excellence to the interval between the natures [[nature]] of which we say that these very states are states: so that, if the [[soul]] is more [[noble]] than our possessions or our bodies [[body]], both absolutely and in relation to us, it must be admitted that the [[best]] [[state]] of either has a similar ratio to the other. again, it is for the sake of the [[soul]] that goods [[good]] external and goods [[good]] of the [[body]] are eligible at all, and all [[wise]] [[men]] ought to choose them for the sake of the [[soul]], and not the [[soul]] for the sake of them. 

let us acknowledge then that each one has just so much of [[happiness]] as he has of [[virtue]] and [[wisdom]], and of [[virtuous]] and [[wise]] action. [[god]] is a witness to us of this [[truth]], for he is [[happy]] and blessed, not by [[reason]] of any external [[good]], but in himself and by [[reason]] of his own [[nature]]. and herein of necessity lies [[lie]] the difference between [[good]] [[fortune]] and [[happiness]]; for external goods [[good]] come of themselves, and [[chance]] is the author of them, but no one is just or temperate by or through [[chance]]. in like manner, and by a similar train of argument, the [[happy]] [[state]] may be shown to be that which is [[best]] and which acts rightly; and rightly it cannot act without doing [[right]] actions, and neither [[individual]] nor [[state]] can do [[right]] actions without [[virtue]] and [[wisdom]]. thus the [[courage]], [[justice]], and [[wisdom]] of a [[state]] have the same form and [[nature]] as the qualities which give the [[individual]] who possesses them the name of just, [[wise]], or temperate. 

thus much may suffice by way of preface: for i could not avoid touching upon these questions [[question]], neither could i go through all the arguments affecting them; these are the [[business]] of another [[science]]. 

let us assume then that the [[best]] [[life]], both for individuals [[individual]] and states, is the [[life]] of [[virtue]], when [[virtue]] has external goods [[good]] enough for the performance of [[good]] actions. if there are any who controvert our assertion, we will in this treatise pass them over, and consider their objections hereafter. 

part ii 

there remains to be discussed the [[question]] whether the [[happiness]] of the [[individual]] is the same as that of the [[state]], or different. here again there can be no doubt- no one denies that they are the same. for those who hold that the well-being of the [[individual]] consists in his [[wealth]], also [[think]] that riches [[rich]] make the [[happiness]] of the whole [[state]], and those who value most highly the [[life]] of a [[tyrant]] deem that [[city]] the happiest which rules [[rule]] over the [[greatest]] number; while they who approve an [[individual]] for his [[virtue]] say that the more [[virtuous]] a [[city]] is, the happier it is. two points here [[present]] themselves for consideration: first (1), which is the more eligible [[life]], that of a citizen who is a member of a [[state]], or that of an alien who has no [[political]] ties; and again (2), which is the [[best]] form of [[constitution]] or the [[best]] condition of a [[state]], either on the supposition that [[political]] privileges [[privilege]] are desirable for all, or for a majority only? since the [[good]] of the [[state]] and not of the [[individual]] is the proper [[subject]] of [[political]] [[thought]] and speculation, and we are engaged in a [[political]] discussion, while the first of these two points has a secondary interest for us, the latter will be the main [[subject]] of our inquiry. 

now it is evident that the form of [[government]] is [[best]] in which every [[man]], whoever he is, can act [[best]] and [[live]] happily. but even those who agree in thinking that the [[life]] of [[virtue]] is the most eligible raise a [[question]], whether the [[life]] of [[business]] and [[politics]] is or is not more eligible than one which is wholly independent of external goods [[good]], i mean than a contemplative [[life]], which by some is maintained to be the only one worthy of a philosopher. for these two lives- the [[life]] of the philosopher and the [[life]] of the statesman- appear to have been preferred by those who have been most keen in the pursuit of [[virtue]], both in our own and in other ages [[age]]. which is the [[better]] is a [[question]] of no small moment; for the [[wise]] [[man]], like the [[wise]] [[state]], will necessarily regulate his [[life]] according to the [[best]] end. there are some who [[think]] that while a despotic [[rule]] over others is the [[greatest]] [[injustice]], to exercise a constitutional [[rule]] over them, even though not [[unjust]], is a [[great]] impediment to a man's [[man]] [[individual]] wellbeing. others take an opposite view; they maintain that the true [[life]] of [[man]] is the practical and [[political]], and that every [[virtue]] admits of being practiced, quite as much by statesmen and rulers as by private individuals [[individual]]. others, again, are of [[opinion]] that arbitrary and [[tyrannical]] [[rule]] alone consists with [[happiness]]; indeed, in some states the entire aim both of the laws [[law]] and of the [[constitution]] is to give [[men]] despotic [[power]] over their neighbors. and, therefore, although in most cities [[city]] the laws [[law]] may be said generally to be in a chaotic [[state]], still, if they aim at anything, they aim at the maintenance of [[power]]: thus in lacedaemon and crete the [[system]] of [[education]] and the greater part of the of the laws [[law]] are framed with a view to [[war]]. and in all nations which are able to gratify their [[ambition]] [[military]] [[power]] is held in esteem, for [[example]] among the scythians and persians and thracians and celts. 

in some nations there are even laws [[law]] tending to stimulate the warlike virtues [[virtue]], as at [[carthage]], where we are told that [[men]] obtain the [[honor]] of wearing as many armlets as they have served campaigns. there was once a [[law]] in macedonia that he who had not killed an [[enemy]] should wear a halter, and among the scythians no one who had not slain his [[man]] was allowed to drink out of the cup which was handed round at a [[certain]] feast. among the iberians, a warlike nation, the number of enemies [[enemy]] whom a [[man]] has slain is indicated by the number of obelisks which are fixed in the [[earth]] round his tomb; and there are numerous practices among other nations of a like [[kind]], some of them established by [[law]] and others by custom. yet to a reflecting [[mind]] it must appear very [[strange]] that the statesman should be always considering how he can dominate and tyrannize over others, whether they will or not. how can that which is not even lawful be the [[business]] of the statesman or the legislator? unlawful it certainly is to [[rule]] without regard to [[justice]], for there may be might where there is no [[right]]. the other [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] offer no parallel a physician is not expected to persuade or coerce his patients, nor a pilot the passengers in his ship. yet most [[men]] appear to [[think]] that the art [[arts]] of despotic [[government]] is statesmanship, and what [[men]] affirm to be [[unjust]] and inexpedient in their own case they are not ashamed of practicing towards others; they demand just [[rule]] for themselves, but where other [[men]] are concerned they [[care]] nothing about it. such behavior is irrational; unless the one party is, and the other is not, born to serve, in which case [[men]] have a [[right]] to command, not indeed all their fellows, but only those who are intended to be subjects [[subject]]; just as we ought not to hunt [[mankind]], whether for food or [[sacrifice]], but only the animals which may be hunted for food or [[sacrifice]], this is to say, such wild animals as are eatable. and surely there may be a [[city]] [[happy]] in isolation, which we will assume to be well-governed (for it is quite possible that a [[city]] thus isolated might be well-administered and have [[good]] laws); but such a [[city]] would not be constituted with any view to [[war]] or the [[conquest]] of enemies- all that sort of thing must be excluded. hence we see very plainly that warlike pursuits, although generally to be deemed honorable, are not the supreme end of all things, but only means. and the [[good]] lawgiver should inquire how states and races [[race]] of [[men]] and communities [[community]] may participate in a [[good]] [[life]], and in the [[happiness]] which is attainable by them. his enactments will not be always the same; and where there are neighbors he will have to see what sort of studies should be practiced in relation to their several characters [[character]], or how the measures appropriate in relation to each are to be adopted. the end at which the [[best]] form of [[government]] should aim may be properly made a matter of future consideration. 

part iii 

let us now address those who, while they agree that the [[life]] of [[virtue]] is the most eligible, differ about the manner of practicing it. for some renounce [[political]] [[power]], and [[think]] that the [[life]] of the freeman is different from the [[life]] of the statesman and the [[best]] of all; but others [[think]] the [[life]] of the statesman [[best]]. the argument of the latter is that he who does nothing cannot do well, and that [[virtuous]] activity is identical with [[happiness]]. to both we say: 'you are partly [[right]] and partly [[wrong]].' first class are [[right]] in affirming that the [[life]] of the freeman is [[better]] than the [[life]] of the despot; for there is nothing grand or [[noble]] in having the use of a [[slave]], in so far as he is a [[slave]]; or in issuing commands about necessary things. but it is an error to suppose that every sort of [[rule]] is despotic like that of a master over slaves [[slave]], for there is as [[great]] a difference between the [[rule]] over freemen and the [[rule]] over slaves [[slave]] as there is between [[slavery]] by [[nature]] and [[freedom]] by [[nature]], about which i have said enough at the commencement of this treatise. and it is equally a mistake to place inactivity above action, for [[happiness]] is activity, and the actions of the just and [[wise]] are the realization of much that is [[noble]]. 

but perhaps some one, accepting these premises, may still maintain that supreme [[power]] is the [[best]] of all things, because the possessors of it are able to perform the [[greatest]] number of [[noble]] actions. if so, the [[man]] who is able to [[rule]], instead of giving up anything to his neighbor, ought rather to take away his [[power]]; and the [[father]] should make no account of his [[son]], nor the [[son]] of his [[father]], nor friend of friend; they should not bestow a [[thought]] on one another in comparison with this higher object, for the [[best]] is the most eligible and 'doing eligible' and 'doing well' is the [[best]]. there might be some [[truth]] in such a view if we assume that robbers and plunderers attain the [[chief]] [[good]]. but this can never be; their hypothesis is false. for the actions of a ruler cannot really be honorable, unless he is as much superior to other [[men]] as a husband is to a [[wife]], or a [[father]] to his [[children]], or a master to his slaves [[slave]]. and therefore he who violates the [[law]] can never recover by any [[success]], however [[great]], what he has already lost in departing from [[virtue]]. for equals [[equal]] the honorable and the just consist in sharing alike, as is just and [[equal]]. but that the unequal should be given to equals [[equal]], and the unlike to those who are like, is contrary to [[nature]], and nothing which is contrary to [[nature]] is [[good]]. if, therefore, there is any one superior in [[virtue]] and in the [[power]] of performing the [[best]] actions, him we ought to [[follow]] and obey, but he must have the capacity for action as well as [[virtue]]. 

if we are [[right]] in our view, and [[happiness]] is assumed to be [[virtuous]] activity, the active [[life]] will be the [[best]], both for every [[city]] collectively, and for individuals [[individual]]. not that a [[life]] of action must necessarily have relation to others, as some persons [[person]] [[think]], nor are those ideas [[idea]] only to be regarded as practical which are pursued for the sake of practical results, but much more the thoughts [[thought]] and contemplations which are independent and complete in themselves; since [[virtuous]] activity, and therefore a [[certain]] [[kind]] of action, is an end, and even in the case of external actions the directing [[mind]] is most truly said to act. neither, again, is it necessary that states which are cut off from others and choose to [[live]] alone should be inactive; for activity, as well as other things, may take place by sections; there are many ways in which the sections of a [[state]] act upon one another. the same thing is equally true of every [[individual]]. if this were otherwise, [[god]] and the [[universe]], who have no external actions over and above their own energies, would be far enough from [[perfection]]. hence it is evident that the same [[life]] is [[best]] for each [[individual]], and for states and for [[mankind]] collectively

thus far by way of introduction. in what has preceded i have discussed other forms of [[government]]; in what remains the first point to be considered is what should be the conditions of the ideal or [[perfect]] [[state]]; for the [[perfect]] [[state]] cannot [[exist]] without a due supply of the means of [[life]]. and therefore we must presuppose many purely imaginary conditions, but nothing impossible. there will be a [[certain]] number of [[citizens]], a [[country]] in which to place them, and the like. as the weaver or shipbuilder or any other artisan must have the material proper for his [[work]] (and in proportion as this is [[better]] prepared, so will the result of his art [[arts]] be nobler), so the statesman or legislator must also have the materials suited to him. 

first among the materials required by the statesman is [[population]]: he will consider what should be the number and [[character]] of the [[citizens]], and then what should be the size and [[character]] of the [[country]]. most persons [[person]] [[think]] that a [[state]] in order to be [[happy]] ought to be large; but even if they are [[right]], they have no [[idea]] what is a large and what a small [[state]]. for they [[judge]] of the size of the [[city]] by the number of the inhabitants; whereas they ought to regard, not their number, but their [[power]]. a [[city]] too, like an [[individual]], has a [[work]] to do; and that [[city]] which is [[best]] adapted to the fulfillment of its [[work]] is to be deemed [[greatest]], in the same sense of the word [[great]] in which hippocrates might be called greater, not as a [[man]], but as a physician, than some one else who was taller and even if we reckon greatness by numbers, we ought not to include everybody, for there must always be in cities [[city]] a multitude of slaves [[slave]] and sojourners and foreigners; but we should include those only who are members of the [[state]], and who form an essential part of it. the number of the latter is a proof of the greatness of a [[city]]; but a [[city]] which produces [[produce]] numerous artisans and comparatively few soldiers cannot be [[great]], for a [[great]] [[city]] is not to be confounded with a populous one. moreover, [[experience]] shows that a very populous [[city]] can rarely, if ever, be well governed; since all cities [[city]] which have a [[reputation]] for [[good]] [[government]] have a limit of [[population]]. we may argue on grounds of [[reason]], and the same result will [[follow]]. for [[law]] is order, and [[good]] [[law]] is [[good]] order; but a very [[great]] multitude cannot be orderly: to introduce order into the unlimited is the [[work]] of a [[divine]] power- of such a [[power]] as holds together the [[universe]]. [[beauty]] is realized in number and magnitude, and the [[state]] which combines magnitude with [[good]] order must necessarily be the most beautiful. to the size of states there is a limit, as there is to other things, plants, animals, implements; for none of these retain their [[natural]] [[power]] when they are too large or too small, but they either wholly lose their [[nature]], or are spoiled. for [[example]], a ship which is only a span long will not be a ship at all, nor a ship a quarter of a mile long; yet there may be a ship of a [[certain]] size, either too large or too small, which will still be a ship, but [[bad]] for sailing. in like manner a [[state]] when composed of too few is not, as a [[state]] ought to be, self-sufficing; when of too many, though self-sufficing in all mere necessaries, as a nation may be, it is not a [[state]], being almost incapable of constitutional [[government]]. for who can be the general of such a vast multitude, or who the herald, unless he have the voice of a stentor? 

a [[state]], then, only begins to [[exist]] when it has attained a [[population]] sufficient for a [[good]] [[life]] in the [[political]] [[community]]: it may indeed, if it somewhat exceed this number, be a greater [[state]]. but, as i was saying, there must be a limit. what should be the limit will be easily ascertained by [[experience]]. for both governors and governed have duties [[duty]] to perform; the special functions of a governor to command and to [[judge]]. but if the [[citizens]] of a [[state]] are to [[judge]] and to distribute offices according to [[merit]], then they must [[know]] each other's characters [[character]]; where they do not possess this [[knowledge]], both the election to offices and the decision of lawsuits will go [[wrong]]. when the [[population]] is very large they are manifestly settled at haphazard, which clearly ought not to be. besides, in an over-populous [[state]] foreigners and metics will readily acquire the rights [[right]] of [[citizens]], for who will find them out? clearly then the [[best]] limit of the [[population]] of a [[state]] is the largest number which suffices for the purposes [[purpose]] of [[life]], and can be taken in at a [[single]] view. enough concerning the size of a [[state]]. 

part v 

much the same [[principle]] will apply to the territory of the [[state]]: every one would agree in praising the territory which is most entirely self-sufficing; and that must be the territory which is all-producing, for to have all things and to want nothing is sufficiency. in size and extent it should be such as may enable the inhabitants to [[live]] at once temperately and liberally in the enjoyment of leisure. whether we are [[right]] or [[wrong]] in laying down this limit we will inquire more precisely hereafter, when we have [[occasion]] to consider what is the [[right]] use of [[property]] and [[wealth]]: a matter which is much disputed, because [[men]] are inclined to rush into one of two extremes, some into meanness, others into luxury. 

it is not difficult to determine the general [[character]] of the territory which is required (there are, however, some points on which [[military]] authorities [[authority]] should be heard); it should be difficult of access to the [[enemy]], and easy of egress to the inhabitants. further, we require that the [[land]] as well as the inhabitants of whom we were just now speaking should be taken in at a [[single]] view, for a [[country]] which is easily seen can be easily protected. as to the position of the [[city]], if we could have what we [[wish]], it should be well situated in regard both to sea and [[land]]. this then is one [[principle]], that it should be a convenient center for the protection of the whole [[country]]: the other is, that it should be suitable for receiving the fruits of the soil, and also for the bringing in of timber and any other products that are easily transported. 

part vi 

whether a communication with the sea is beneficial to a well-ordered [[state]] or not is a [[question]] which has often been [[asked]]. it is argued that the introduction of strangers brought up under other laws [[law]], and the increase of [[population]], will be adverse to [[good]] order; the increase arises from their using the sea and having a crowd of merchants coming and going, and is inimical to [[good]] [[government]]. apart from these considerations, it would be undoubtedly [[better]], both with a view to safety and to the provision of necessaries, that the [[city]] and territory should be connected with the sea; the defenders of a [[country]], if they are to maintain themselves against an [[enemy]], should be easily relieved both by [[land]] and by sea; and even if they are not able to attack by sea and [[land]] at once, they will have less difficulty in doing mischief to their assailants on one element, if they themselves can use both. moreover, it is necessary that they should import from abroad what is not found in their own [[country]], and that they should export what they have in excess; for a [[city]] ought to be a market, not indeed for others, but for herself. 

those who make themselves a market for the [[world]] only do so for the sake of [[revenue]], and if a [[state]] ought not to [[desire]] [[profit]] of this [[kind]] it ought not to have such an emporium. nowadays we often see in countries [[country]] and cities [[city]] dockyards and harbors very conveniently placed outside the [[city]], but not too far off; and they are kept in dependence by walls and similar fortifications. cities [[city]] thus situated manifestly reap the benefit of intercourse with their ports; and any harm which is likely to accrue may be easily guarded against by the laws [[law]], which will pronounce and determine who may hold communication with one another, and who may not. 

there can be no [[doubt]] that the possession of a moderate naval [[force]] is advantageous to a [[city]]; the [[city]] should be formidable not only to its own [[citizens]] but to some of its neighbors, or, if necessary, able to assist them by sea as well as by [[land]]. the proper number or magnitude of this naval [[force]] is relative to the [[character]] of the [[state]]; for if her function is to take a leading part in [[politics]], her naval [[power]] should be commensurate with the scale of her enterprises. the [[population]] of the [[state]] need not be much increased, since there is no necessity that the sailors should be [[citizens]]: the marines who have the control and command will be freemen, and belong also to the infantry; and wherever there is a dense [[population]] of perioeci and husbandmen, there will always be sailors more than enough. of this we see instances at the [[present]] day. the [[city]] of heraclea, for [[example]], although small in comparison with many others, can [[man]] a considerable fleet. such are our conclusions respecting the territory of the [[state]], its harbors, its towns, its relations to the sea, and its maritime [[power]]. 

part vii 

having spoken of the number of the [[citizens]], we will proceed to speak of what should be their [[character]]. this is a [[subject]] which can be easily understood by any one who casts his eye on the more celebrated states of hellas, and generally on the distribution of races [[race]] in the habitable [[world]]. those who [[live]] in a cold [[climate]] and in [[europe]] are full of spirit, but wanting in [[intelligence]] and [[skill]]; and therefore they retain comparative [[freedom]], but have no [[political]] organization, and are incapable of ruling over others. whereas the natives of [[asia]] are [[intelligent]] and inventive, but they are wanting in spirit, and therefore they are always in a [[state]] of subjection and [[slavery]]. but the hellenic [[race]], which is situated between them, is likewise intermediate in [[character]], being high-spirited and also [[intelligent]]. hence it continues [[free]], and is the best-governed of any nation, and, if it could be formed into one [[state]], would be able to [[rule]] the [[world]]. there are also similar differences in the different tribes of hellas; for some of them are of a one-sided [[nature]], and are [[intelligent]] or courageous only, while in others there is a [[happy]] combination of both qualities. and clearly those whom the legislator will most easily lead to [[virtue]] may be expected to be both [[intelligent]] and courageous. some say that the guardians should be friendly towards those whom they [[know]], fierce towards those whom they do not [[know]]. now, passion is the quality of the [[soul]] which begets [[friendship]] and enables us to [[love]]; notably the spirit within us is more stirred against our [[friends]] and acquaintances than against those who are unknown to us, when we [[think]] that we are despised by them; for which [[reason]] archilochus, complaining of his [[friends]], very naturally addresses his [[soul]] in these words: 

"for surely thou art [[arts]] plagued on account of [[friends]]. "



the [[power]] of command and the [[love]] of [[freedom]] are in all [[men]] based upon this quality, for passion is commanding and invincible. nor is it [[right]] to say that the guardians should be fierce towards those whom they do not [[know]], for we ought not to be out of temper with any one; and a lofty spirit is not fierce by [[nature]], but only when excited against evil-doers. and this, as i was saying before, is a feeling which [[men]] show most strongly towards their [[friends]] if they [[think]] they have received a [[wrong]] at their hands: as indeed is reasonable; for, besides the actual injury, they seem to be deprived of a benefit by those who owe them one. hence the saying: 

"cruel is the strife of brethren [[brother]], "

and again: 

"they who [[love]] in excess also hate in excess. "



thus we have nearly determined the number and [[character]] of the [[citizens]] of our [[state]], and also the size and [[nature]] of their territory. i say 'nearly,' for we ought not to require the same minuteness in theory as in the facts [[fact]] given by perception. 

part viii 

as in other [[natural]] compounds the conditions of a composite whole are not necessarily organic parts of it, so in a [[state]] or in any other combination forming a unity not everything is a part, which is a necessary condition. the members of an association have necessarily some one thing the same and [[common]] to all, in which they share equally or unequally for [[example]], food or [[land]] or any other thing. but where there are two things of which one is a means and the other an end, they have nothing in [[common]] except that the one receives what the other produces [[produce]]. such, for [[example]], is the relation which workmen and tools stand to their [[work]]; the house and the builder have nothing in [[common]], but the art [[arts]] of the builder is for the sake of the house. and so states require [[property]], but [[property]], even though living beings are included in it, is no part of a [[state]]; for a [[state]] is not a [[community]] of living beings only, but a [[community]] of equals [[equal]], aiming at the [[best]] [[life]] possible. now, whereas [[happiness]] is the highest [[good]], being a realization and [[perfect]] practice of [[virtue]], which some can attain, while others have little or none of it, the various qualities of [[men]] are clearly the [[reason]] why there are various kinds [[kind]] of states and many forms of [[government]]; for different [[men]] seek after [[happiness]] in different ways and by different means, and so make for themselves different modes of [[life]] and forms of [[government]]. we must see also how many things are indispensable to the existence of a [[state]], for what we call the parts of a [[state]] will be found among the indispensables. let us then enumerate the functions of a [[state]], and we shall easily elicit what we want: 

first, there must be food; secondly, [[arts]], for [[life]] requires many instruments; thirdly, there must be arms, for the members of a [[community]] have need of them, and in their own hands, too, in order to maintain [[authority]] both against disobedient subjects [[subject]] and against external assailants; fourthly, there must be a [[certain]] amount of [[revenue]], both for internal needs, and for the purposes [[purpose]] of [[war]]; fifthly, or rather first, there must be a [[care]] of [[religion]] which is commonly called [[worship]]; sixthly, and most necessary of all there must be a [[power]] of deciding what is for the [[public]] interest, and what is just in men's dealings with one another. 

these are the services which every [[state]] may be said to need. for a [[state]] is not a mere aggregate of persons [[person]], but a union of them sufficing for the purposes [[purpose]] of [[life]]; and if any of these things be wanting, it is as we maintain impossible that the [[community]] can be absolutely self-sufficing. a [[state]] then should be framed with a view to the fulfillment of these functions. there must be husbandmen to procure food, and artisans, and a warlike and a wealthy class, and priests [[priest]], and judges [[judge]] to decide what is necessary and expedient. 

part ix 

having determined these points, we have in the next place to consider whether all ought to share in every sort of occupation. shall every [[man]] be at once husbandman, artisan, councillor, [[judge]], or shall we suppose the several occupations just mentioned assigned to different persons [[person]]? or, thirdly, shall some employments be assigned to individuals [[individual]] and others [[common]] to all? the same arrangement, however, does not occur in every [[constitution]]; as we were saying, all may be shared by all, or not all by all, but only by some; and hence arise the differences of constitutions [[constitution]], for in democracies [[democracy]] all share in all, in oligarchies the opposite practice prevails. now, since we are here speaking of the [[best]] form of [[government]], i.e., that under which the [[state]] will be most [[happy]] (and [[happiness]], as has been already said, cannot [[exist]] without virtue), it clearly follows that in the [[state]] which is [[best]] governed and possesses [[men]] who are just absolutely, and not merely relatively to the [[principle]] of the [[constitution]], the [[citizens]] must not lead the [[life]] of mechanics or tradesmen, for such a [[life]] is ignoble, and inimical to [[virtue]]. neither must they be husbandmen, since leisure is necessary both for the [[development]] of [[virtue]] and the performance of [[political]] duties [[duty]]. 

again, there is in a [[state]] a class of warriors, and another of councillors, who advise about the expedient and determine matters of [[law]], and these seem in an especial manner parts of a [[state]]. now, should these two classes be distinguished, or are both functions to be assigned to the same persons [[person]]? here again there is no difficulty in seeing that both functions will in one way belong to the same, in another, to different persons [[person]]. to different persons [[person]] in so far as these i.e., the physical and the employments are suited to different primes of [[life]], for the one requires mental [[wisdom]] and the other [[strength]]. but on the other hand, since it is an impossible thing that those who are able to use or to resist [[force]] should be willing to remain always in subjection, from this point of view the persons [[person]] are the same; for those who carry arms can always determine the [[fate]] of the [[constitution]]. it remains therefore that both functions should be entrusted by the ideal [[constitution]] to the same persons [[person]], not, however, at the same [[time]], but in the order prescribed by [[nature]], who has given to [[young]] [[men]] [[strength]] and to older [[men]] [[wisdom]]. such a distribution of duties [[duty]] will be expedient and also just, and is founded upon a [[principle]] of conformity to [[merit]]. besides, the ruling class should be the owners of [[property]], for they are [[citizens]], and the [[citizens]] of a [[state]] should be in [[good]] circumstances; whereas mechanics or any other class which is not a producer of [[virtue]] have no share in the [[state]]. this follows from our first [[principle]], for [[happiness]] cannot [[exist]] without [[virtue]], and a [[city]] is not to be termed [[happy]] in regard to a portion of the [[citizens]], but in regard to them all. and clearly [[property]] should be in their hands, since the husbandmen will of necessity be slaves [[slave]] or barbarian perioeci. 

of the classes enumerated there remain only the priests [[priest]], and the manner in which their office is to be regulated is obvious. no husbandman or mechanic should be appointed to it; for the gods should receive [[honor]] from the [[citizens]] only. now since the [[body]] of the citizen is divided into two classes, the warriors and the councillors and it is beseeming that the [[worship]] of the gods should be duly performed, and also a rest provided in their service for those who from [[age]] have given up active [[life]], to the old [[men]] of these two classes should be assigned the duties [[duty]] of the priesthood. 

we have shown what are the necessary conditions, and what the parts of a [[state]]: husbandmen, craftsmen, and laborers of an kinds [[kind]] are necessary to the existence of states, but the parts of the [[state]] are the warriors and councillors. and these are distinguished severally from one another, the distinction being in some cases permanent, in others not. 

part x 

it is not a new or recent discovery of [[political]] [[philosophers]] that the [[state]] ought to be divided into classes, and that the warriors should be separated from the husbandmen. the [[system]] has continued in [[egypt]] and in crete to this day, and was established, as tradition says, by a [[law]] of sesostris in [[egypt]] and of minos in crete. the institution of [[common]] tables also appears to be of ancient date, being in crete as old as the reign of minos, and in [[italy]] far older. the italian historians say that there was a [[certain]] italus, [[king]] of oenotria, from whom the oenotrians were called italians, and who gave the name of [[italy]] to the promontory of [[europe]] lying within the scylletic and lametic gulfs, which are distant from one another only half a day's [[journey]]. they say that this italus converted the oenotrians from shepherds into husbandmen, and besides other laws [[law]] which he gave them, was the founder of their [[common]] meals; even in our day some who are derived from him retain this institution and [[certain]] other laws [[law]] of his. on the side of [[italy]] towards tyrrhenia dwelt the opici, who are now, as of old, called ausones; and on the side towards iapygia and the ionian gulf, in the district called siritis, the chones, who are likewise of oenotrian [[race]]. from this part of the [[world]] originally came the institution of [[common]] tables; the separation into castes from [[egypt]], for the reign of sesostris is of far greater antiquity than that of minos. it is true indeed that these and many other things have been [[invented]] several times [[time]] over in the course of ages [[age]], or rather times [[time]] without number; for necessity may be supposed to have taught [[men]] the inventions which were absolutely required, and when these were provided, it was [[natural]] that other things which would adorn and enrich [[life]] should grow up by degrees [[degree]]. and we may infer that in [[political]] [[institutions]] the same [[rule]] holds. [[egypt]] witnesses to the antiquity of all these things, for the [[egyptians]] appear to be of all [[people]] the most ancient; and they have laws [[law]] and a regular [[constitution]] existing from [[time]] immemorial. we should therefore make the [[best]] use of what has been already discovered, and try to supply defects. 

i have already remarked that the [[land]] ought to belong to those who possess arms and have a share in the [[government]], and that the husbandmen ought to be a class distinct from them; and i have determined what should be the extent and [[nature]] of the territory. let me proceed to discuss the distribution of the [[land]], and the [[character]] of the agricultural class; for i do not [[think]] that [[property]] ought to be [[common]], as some maintain, but only that by friendly [[consent]] there should be a [[common]] use of it; and that no citizen should be in want of subsistence. 

as to [[common]] meals, there is a general agreement that a well ordered [[city]] should have them; and we will hereafter explain what are our own reasons [[reason]] for taking this view. they ought, however, to be open to all the [[citizens]]. and yet it is not easy for the [[poor]] to contribute the requisite sum out of their private means, and to provide also for their household. the expense of [[religious]] [[worship]] should likewise be a [[public]] charge. the [[land]] must therefore be divided into two parts, one [[public]] and the other private, and each part should be subdivided, part of the [[public]] [[land]] being appropriated to the service of the gods, and the other part used to defray the cost of the [[common]] meals; while of the private [[land]], part should be near the border, and the other near the [[city]], so that, each citizen having two lots, they may all of them have [[land]] in both places; there is [[justice]] and fairness in such a division, and it tends to inspire unanimity among the [[people]] in their border wars [[war]]. where there is not this arrangement some of them are too ready to come to blows with their neighbors, while others are so cautious that they quite lose the sense of [[honor]]. wherefore there is a [[law]] in some places which forbids those who dwell near the border to take part in [[public]] deliberations about wars [[war]] with neighbors, on the ground that their interests will pervert their [[judgment]]. for the reasons [[reason]] already mentioned, then, the [[land]] should be divided in the manner described. the very [[best]] thing of all would be that the husbandmen should be slaves [[slave]] taken from among [[men]] who are not all of the same [[race]] and not spirited, for if they have no spirit they will be [[better]] suited for their [[work]], and there will be no danger of their making a [[revolution]]. the next [[best]] thing would be that they should be perioeci of [[foreign]] [[race]], and of a like inferior [[nature]]; some of them should be the slaves [[slave]] of individuals [[individual]], and employed in the private estates of [[men]] of [[property]], the remainder should be the [[property]] of the [[state]] and employed on the [[common]] [[land]]. i will hereafter explain what is the proper treatment of slaves [[slave]], and why it is expedient that [[liberty]] should be always held out to them as the [[reward]] of their services. 

part xi 

we have already said that the [[city]] should be open to the [[land]] and to the sea, and to the whole [[country]] as far as possible. in [[respect]] of the place itself our [[wish]] would be that its situation should be fortunate in four things. the first, health- this is a necessity: cities [[city]] which [[lie]] towards the east, and are blown upon by winds coming from the east, are the healthiest; next in healthfulness are those which are sheltered from the north wind, for they have a milder winter. the site of the [[city]] should likewise be convenient both for [[political]] administration and for [[war]]. with a view to the latter it should afford easy egress to the [[citizens]], and at the same [[time]] be inaccessible and difficult of capture to enemies [[enemy]]. there should be a [[natural]] abundance of springs and fountains in the town, or, if there is a deficiency of them, [[great]] reservoirs may be established for the collection of rainwater, such as will not fail when the inhabitants are cut off from the [[country]] by by [[war]]. special [[care]] should be taken of the health of the inhabitants, which will depend chiefly on the healthiness of the locality and of the quarter to which they are exposed, and secondly, on the use of pure water; this latter point is by no means a secondary consideration. for the elements which we use most and oftenest for the support of the [[body]] contribute most to health, and among these are water and air. wherefore, in all [[wise]] states, if there is a want of pure water, and the supply is not all equally [[good]], the drinking water ought to be separated from that which is used for other purposes [[purpose]]. 

as to strongholds, what is suitable to different forms of [[government]] varies: thus an acropolis is suited to an [[oligarchy]] or a [[monarchy]], but a plain to a [[democracy]]; neither to an [[aristocracy]], but rather a number of [[strong]] places. the arrangement of private houses is considered to be more agreeable and generally more convenient, if the streets are regularly laid out after the [[modern]] [[fashion]] which hippodamus introduced, but for security in [[war]] the antiquated mode of building, which made it difficult for strangers to get out of a town and for assailants to find their way in, is preferable. a [[city]] should therefore adopt both plans of building: it is possible to arrange the houses irregularly, as husbandmen plant their vines in what are called 'clumps.' the whole town should not be laid out in straight lines, but only [[certain]] quarters and regions; thus security and [[beauty]] will be combined. 

as to walls, those who say that cities [[city]] making any pretension to [[military]] [[virtue]] should not have them, are quite out of date in their notions; and they may see the cities [[city]] which prided themselves on this fancy confuted by facts [[fact]]. true, there is little [[courage]] shown in seeking for safety behind a rampart when an [[enemy]] is similar in [[character]] and not much superior in number; but the superiority of the besiegers may be and often is too much both for ordinary [[human]] valor and for that which is found only in a few; and if they are to be saved and to escape defeat and outrage, the strongest wall will be the truest soldierly precaution, more especially now that missiles and siege engines have been brought to such [[perfection]]. to have no walls would be as foolish as to choose a site for a town in an exposed [[country]], and to level the heights; or as if an [[individual]] were to leave his house unwalled, lest the inmates should become cowards. nor must we forget that those who have their cities [[city]] surrounded by walls may either take advantage of them or not, but cities [[city]] which are unwalled have no [[choice]]. 

if our conclusions are just, not only should cities [[city]] have walls, but [[care]] should be taken to make them ornamental, as well as useful for warlike purposes [[purpose]], and adapted to resist [[modern]] inventions. for as the assailants of a [[city]] do all they can to gain an advantage, so the defenders should make use of any means of defense which have been already discovered, and should devise and invent others, for when [[men]] are well prepared no [[enemy]] even thinks [[think]] of attacking them. 

part xii 

as the walls are to be divided by guardhouses and towers built at suitable intervals, and the [[body]] of [[citizens]] must be distributed at [[common]] tables, the [[idea]] will naturally occur that we should establish some of the [[common]] tables in the guardhouses. these might be arranged as has been suggested; while the principal [[common]] tables of the magistrates will occupy a suitable place, and there also will be the buildings appropriated to [[religious]] [[worship]] except in the case of those rites which the [[law]] or the pythian oracle has restricted to a special locality. the site should be a spot seen far and wide, which gives due elevation to [[virtue]] and towers over the neighborhood. below this spot should be established an agora, such as that which the thessalians call the 'freemen's agora'; from this all [[trade]] should be excluded, and no mechanic, husbandman, or any such [[person]] allowed to enter, unless he be summoned by the magistrates. it would be a charming use of the place, if the gymnastic exercises of the elder [[men]] were performed there. for in this [[noble]] practice different ages [[age]] should be separated, and some of the magistrates should stay with the boys, while the grown-up [[men]] remain with the magistrates; for the presence of the magistrates is the [[best]] mode of inspiring true modesty and ingenuous [[fear]]. there should also be a traders' agora, distinct and apart from the other, in a situation which is convenient for the reception of goods [[good]] both by sea and [[land]]. 

but in speaking of the magistrates we must not forget another section of the [[citizens]], viz., the priests [[priest]], for whom [[public]] tables should likewise be provided in their proper place near the temples. the magistrates who deal with contracts, indictments, summonses, and the like, and those who have the [[care]] of the agora and of the [[city]], respectively, ought to be established near an agora and some [[public]] place of meeting; the neighborhood of the traders' agora will be a suitable spot; the upper agora we devote to the [[life]] of leisure, the other is intended for the necessities of [[trade]]. 

the same order should prevail in the [[country]], for there too the magistrates, called by some 'inspectors of forests' and by others 'wardens of the [[country]],' must have guardhouses and [[common]] tables while they are on [[duty]]; temples should also be scattered throughout the [[country]], dedicated, some to gods, and some to heroes. 

but it would be a waste of [[time]] for us to linger over details like these. the difficulty is not in imagining but in carrying them out. we may talk about them as much as we like, but the execution of them will depend upon [[fortune]]. wherefore let us say no more about these matters for the [[present]]. 

part xiii 

returning to the [[constitution]] itself, let us seek to determine out of what and what sort of elements the [[state]] which is to be [[happy]] and well-governed should be composed. there are two things in which all which all well-being consists: one of them is the [[choice]] of a [[right]] end and aim of action, and the other the discovery of the actions which are means towards it; for the means and the end may agree or disagree. sometimes the [[right]] end is set before [[men]], but in practice they fail to attain it; in other cases they are successful in all the means, but they propose to themselves a [[bad]] end; and sometimes they fail in both. take, for [[example]], the art [[arts]] of medicine; physicians do not always [[understand]] the [[nature]] of health, and also the means which they use may not effect the [[desired]] end. in all [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] both the end and the means should be equally within our control. 

the [[happiness]] and well-being which all [[men]] manifestly [[desire]], some have the [[power]] of attaining, but to others, from some accident or defect of [[nature]], the attainment of them is not granted; for a [[good]] [[life]] requires a supply of external goods [[good]], in a less [[degree]] when [[men]] are in a [[good]] [[state]], in a greater [[degree]] when they are in a lower [[state]]. others again, who possess the conditions of [[happiness]], go utterly [[wrong]] from the first in the pursuit of it. but since our object is to discover the [[best]] form of [[government]], that, namely, under which a [[city]] will be [[best]] governed, and since the [[city]] is [[best]] governed which has the [[greatest]] opportunity of obtaining [[happiness]], it is evident that we must clearly ascertain the [[nature]] of [[happiness]]. 

we maintain, and have said in the ethics, if the arguments there adduced are of any value, that [[happiness]] is the realization and [[perfect]] exercise of [[virtue]], and this not conditional, but absolute. and i used the term 'conditional' to express that which is indispensable, and 'absolute' to express that which is [[good]] in itself. take the case of just actions; just punishments [[punishment]] and chastisements do indeed spring from a [[good]] [[principle]], but they are [[good]] only because we cannot do without them- it would be [[better]] that neither individuals [[individual]] nor states should need anything of the sort- but actions which aim at [[honor]] and advantage are absolutely the [[best]]. the conditional action is only the [[choice]] of a lesser [[evil]]; whereas these are the foundation and creation of [[good]]. a [[good]] [[man]] may make the [[best]] even of [[poverty]] and disease, and the other ills of [[life]]; but he can only attain [[happiness]] under the opposite conditions (for this also has been determined in accordance with ethical arguments, that the [[good]] [[man]] is he for whom, because he is [[virtuous]], the things that are absolutely [[good]] are [[good]]; it is also plain that his use of these goods [[good]] must be [[virtuous]] and in the absolute sense good). this makes [[men]] fancy that external goods [[good]] are the cause of [[happiness]], yet we might as well say that a brilliant performance on the lyre was to be attributed to the instrument and not to the [[skill]] of the performer. 

it follows then from what has been said that some things the legislator must find ready to his hand in a [[state]], others he must provide. and therefore we can only say: may our [[state]] be constituted in such a manner as to be blessed with the goods [[good]] of which [[fortune]] disposes (for we acknowledge her power): whereas [[virtue]] and goodness in the [[state]] are not a matter of [[chance]] but the result of [[knowledge]] and [[purpose]]. a [[city]] can be [[virtuous]] only when the [[citizens]] who have a share in the [[government]] are [[virtuous]], and in our [[state]] all the [[citizens]] share in the [[government]]; let us then inquire how a [[man]] becomes [[virtuous]]. for even if we could suppose the citizen [[body]] to be [[virtuous]], without each of them being so, yet the latter would be [[better]], for in the [[virtue]] of each the [[virtue]] of all is involved. 

there are three things which make [[men]] [[good]] and [[virtuous]]; these are [[nature]], habit, [[rational]] [[principle]]. in the first place, every one must be born a [[man]] and not some other animal; so, too, he must have a [[certain]] [[character]], both of [[body]] and [[soul]]. but some qualities there is no use in having at birth, for they are altered by habit, and there are some gifts which by [[nature]] are made to be turned by habit to [[good]] or [[bad]]. animals lead for the most part a [[life]] of [[nature]], although in lesser particulars some are influenced by habit as well. [[man]] has [[rational]] [[principle]], in addition, and [[man]] only. wherefore [[nature]], habit, [[rational]] [[principle]] must be in harmony with one another; for they do not always agree; [[men]] do many things against habit and [[nature]], if [[rational]] [[principle]] persuades them that they ought. we have already determined what natures [[nature]] are likely to be most easily molded by the hands of the legislator. an else is the [[work]] of [[education]]; we learn some things by habit and some by instruction. 

part xiv 

since every [[political]] [[society]] is composed of rulers and subjects [[subject]] let us consider whether the relations of one to the other should interchange or be permanent. for the [[education]] of the [[citizens]] will necessarily vary with the [[answer]] given to this [[question]]. now, if some [[men]] excelled others in the same [[degree]] in which gods and heroes are supposed to excel [[mankind]] in general (having in the first place a [[great]] advantage even in their bodies [[body]], and secondly in their minds), so that the superiority of the governors was undisputed and patent to their subjects [[subject]], it would clearly be [[better]] that once for an the one class should [[rule]] and the other serve. but since this is unattainable, and kings [[king]] have no marked superiority over their subjects [[subject]], such as scylax affirms to be found among the indians [[indian]], it is obviously necessary on many grounds that all the [[citizens]] alike should take their turn of governing and being governed. equality consists in the same treatment of similar persons [[person]], and no [[government]] can stand which is not founded upon [[justice]]. for if the [[government]] be [[unjust]] every one in the [[country]] unites with the governed in the [[desire]] to have a [[revolution]], and it is an impossibility that the members of the [[government]] can be so numerous as to be stronger than all their enemies [[enemy]] put together. yet that governors should excel their subjects [[subject]] is undeniable. how all this is to be effected, and in what way they will respectively share in the [[government]], the legislator has to consider. the [[subject]] has been already mentioned. [[nature]] herself has provided the distinction when she made a difference between old and [[young]] within the same [[species]], of whom she fitted the one to govern and the other to be governed. no one takes offense at being governed when he is [[young]], nor does he [[think]] himself [[better]] than his governors, especially if he will enjoy the same [[privilege]] when he reaches the required [[age]]. 

we conclude that from one point of view governors and governed are identical, and from another different. and therefore their [[education]] must be the same and also different. for he who would learn to command well must, as [[men]] say, first of all learn to obey. as i observed in the first part of this treatise, there is one [[rule]] which is for the sake of the rulers and another [[rule]] which is for the sake of the ruled; the former is a despotic, the latter a [[free]] [[government]]. some commands differ not in the thing commanded, but in the intention with which they are imposed. wherefore, many apparently menial offices are an [[honor]] to the [[free]] [[youth]] by whom they are performed; for actions do not differ as honorable or dishonorable in themselves so much as in the end and intention of them. but since we say that the [[virtue]] of the citizen and ruler is the same as that of the [[good]] [[man]], and that the same [[person]] must first be a [[subject]] and then a ruler, the legislator has to see that they become [[good]] [[men]], and by what means this may be accomplished, and what is the end of the [[perfect]] [[life]]. 

now the [[soul]] of [[man]] is divided into two parts, one of which has a [[rational]] [[principle]] in itself, and the other, not having a [[rational]] [[principle]] in itself, is able to obey such a [[principle]]. and we call a [[man]] in any way [[good]] because he has the virtues [[virtue]] of these two parts. in which of them the end is more likely to be found is no matter of [[doubt]] to those who adopt our division; for in the [[world]] both of [[nature]] and of art [[arts]] the inferior always exists for the sake of the [[better]] or superior, and the [[better]] or superior is that which has a [[rational]] [[principle]]. this [[principle]], too, in our ordinary way of speaking, is divided into two kinds [[kind]], for there is a practical and a speculative [[principle]]. this part, then, must evidently be similarly divided. and there must be a corresponding division of actions; the actions of the naturally [[better]] part are to be preferred by those who have it in their [[power]] to attain to two out of the three or to all, for that is always to every one the most eligible which is the highest attainable by him. the whole of [[life]] is further divided into two parts, [[business]] and leisure, [[war]] and [[peace]], and of actions some aim at what is necessary and useful, and some at what is honorable. and the preference given to one or the other class of actions must necessarily be like the preference given to one or other part of the [[soul]] and its actions over the other; there must be [[war]] for the sake of [[peace]], [[business]] for the sake of leisure, things useful and necessary for the sake of things honorable. all these points the statesman should keep in view when he frames his laws [[law]]; he should consider the parts of the [[soul]] and their functions, and above all the [[better]] and the end; he should also [[remember]] the diversities of [[human]] lives [[life]] and actions. for [[men]] must be able to engage in [[business]] and go to [[war]], but leisure and [[peace]] are [[better]]; they must do what is necessary and indeed what is useful, but what is honorable is [[better]]. on such principles [[principle]] [[children]] and persons [[person]] of every [[age]] which requires [[education]] should be trained. whereas even the hellenes of the [[present]] day who are reputed to be [[best]] governed, and the legislators who gave them their constitutions [[constitution]], do not appear to have framed their governments [[government]] with a regard to the [[best]] end, or to have given them laws [[law]] and [[education]] with a view to all the virtues [[virtue]], but in a vulgar spirit have fallen back on those which promised to be more useful and profitable. many [[modern]] writers have taken a similar view: they commend the lacedaemonian [[constitution]], and [[praise]] the legislator for making [[conquest]] and [[war]] his sole aim, a doctrine which may be refuted by argument and has long ago been refuted by facts [[fact]]. for most [[men]] [[desire]] [[empire]] in the [[hope]] of accumulating the goods [[good]] of [[fortune]]; and on this ground thibron and all those who have written about the lacedaemonian [[constitution]] have praised their legislator, because the lacedaemonians, by being trained to meet dangers, gained [[great]] [[power]]. but surely they are not a [[happy]] [[people]] now that their [[empire]] has passed away, nor was their legislator [[right]]. how ridiculous is the result, if, when they are continuing in the observance of his laws [[law]] and no one interferes with them, they have lost the [[better]] part of life! these writers further err about the sort of [[government]] which the legislator should approve, for the [[government]] of freemen is nobler and implies more [[virtue]] than despotic [[government]]. neither is a [[city]] to be deemed [[happy]] or a legislator to be praised because he trains his [[citizens]] to conquer and obtain dominion over their neighbors, for there is [[great]] [[evil]] in this. on a similar [[principle]] any citizen who could, should obviously try to obtain the [[power]] in his own state- the crime which the lacedaemonians accuse [[king]] pausanias of attempting, although he had so [[great]] [[honor]] already. no such [[principle]] and no [[law]] having this object is either statesmanlike or useful or [[right]]. for the same things are [[best]] both for individuals [[individual]] and for states, and these are the things which the legislator ought to implant in the minds [[mind]] of his [[citizens]]. 

neither should [[men]] study [[war]] with a view to the enslavement of those who do not deserve to be enslaved; but first of all they should provide against their own enslavement, and in the second place obtain [[empire]] for the [[good]] of the governed, and not for the sake of exercising a general despotism, and in the third place they should seek to be masters only over those who deserve to be slaves [[slave]]. facts [[fact]], as well as arguments, prove that the legislator should direct all his [[military]] and other measures to the provision of leisure and the establishment of [[peace]]. for most of these [[military]] states are safe only while they are at [[war]], but fall when they have acquired their [[empire]]; like unused iron they lose their temper in [[time]] of [[peace]]. and for this the legislator is to blame, he never having taught them how to lead the [[life]] of [[peace]]. 

part xv 

since the end of individuals [[individual]] and of states is the same, the end of the [[best]] [[man]] and of the [[best]] [[constitution]] must also be the same; it is therefore evident that there ought to [[exist]] in both of them the virtues [[virtue]] of leisure; for [[peace]], as has been often repeated, is the end of [[war]], and leisure of toil. but leisure and cultivation may be promoted, not only by those virtues [[virtue]] which are practiced in leisure, but also by some of those which are useful to [[business]]. for many necessaries of [[life]] have to be supplied before we can have leisure. therefore a [[city]] must be temperate and brave, and able to endure: for truly, as the proverb says, 'there is no leisure for slaves [[slave]],' and those who cannot face danger like [[men]] are the slaves [[slave]] of any invader. [[courage]] and endurance are required for [[business]] and [[philosophy]] for leisure, temperance and [[justice]] for both, and more especially in times [[time]] of [[peace]] and leisure, for [[war]] compels [[men]] to be just and temperate, whereas the enjoyment of [[good]] [[fortune]] and the leisure which comes with [[peace]] tend to make them insolent. those then who seem to be the best-off and to be in the possession of every [[good]], have special need of [[justice]] and temperance- for [[example]], those (if such there be, as the poets say) who dwell in the islands of the blest; they above all will need [[philosophy]] and temperance and [[justice]], and all the more the more leisure they have, living in the midst of abundance. there is no difficulty in seeing why the [[state]] that would be [[happy]] and [[good]] ought to have these virtues [[virtue]]. if it be disgraceful in [[men]] not to be able to use the goods [[good]] of [[life]], it is peculiarly disgraceful not to be able to use them in [[time]] of leisure- to show excellent qualities in action and [[war]], and when they have [[peace]] and leisure to be no [[better]] than slaves [[slave]]. wherefore we should not practice [[virtue]] after the manner of the lacedaemonians. for they, while agreeing with other [[men]] in their conception of the highest goods [[good]], differ from the rest of [[mankind]] in thinking that they are to be obtained by the practice of a [[single]] [[virtue]]. and since they [[think]] these goods [[good]] and the enjoyment of them greater than the enjoyment derived from the virtues [[virtue]] ... and that it should be practiced for its own sake, is evident from what has been said; we must now consider how and by what means it is to be attained. 

we have already determined that [[nature]] and habit and [[rational]] [[principle]] are required, and, of these, the proper [[nature]] of the [[citizens]] has also been defined by us. but we have still to consider whether the training of early [[life]] is to be that of [[rational]] [[principle]] or habit, for these two must accord, and when in accord they will then form the [[best]] of harmonies. the [[rational]] [[principle]] may be mistaken and fail in attaining the highest ideal of [[life]], and there may be a like [[evil]] influence of habit. thus much is clear in the first place, that, as in all other things, birth implies an antecedent beginning, and that there are beginnings whose end is relative to a further end. now, in [[men]] [[rational]] [[principle]] and [[mind]] are the end towards which [[nature]] strives, so that the birth and [[moral]] discipline of the [[citizens]] ought to be ordered with a view to them. in the second place, as the [[soul]] and [[body]] are two, we see also that there are two parts of the [[soul]], the [[rational]] and the irrational, and two corresponding states- [[reason]] and appetite. and as the [[body]] is prior in order of [[generation]] to the [[soul]], so the irrational is prior to the [[rational]]. the proof is that anger and wishing and [[desire]] are implanted in [[children]] from their very birth, but [[reason]] and understanding are developed as they grow older. wherefore, the [[care]] of the [[body]] ought to precede that of the [[soul]], and the training of the appetitive part should [[follow]]: none the less our [[care]] of it must be for the sake of the [[reason]], and our [[care]] of the [[body]] for the sake of the [[soul]]. 

part xvi 

since the legislator should begin by considering how the frames of the [[children]] whom he is rearing may be as [[good]] as possible, his first [[care]] will be about marriage- at what [[age]] should his [[citizens]] [[marry]], and who are fit to [[marry]]? in legislating on this [[subject]] he ought to consider the persons [[person]] and the length of their [[life]], that their procreative [[life]] may terminate at the same period, and that they may not differ in their bodily powers [[power]], as will be the case if the [[man]] is still able to beget [[children]] while the woman is unable to bear them, or the woman able to bear while the [[man]] is unable to beget, for from these causes arise quarrels and differences between [[married]] persons [[person]]. secondly, he must consider the [[time]] at which the [[children]] will succeed to their parents; there ought not to be too [[great]] an interval of [[age]], for then the parents will be too old to derive any [[pleasure]] from their affection, or to be of any use to them. nor ought they to be too nearly of an [[age]]; to youthful marriages [[marriage]] there are many objections- the [[children]] will be wanting in [[respect]] to the parents, who will seem to be their contemporaries, and disputes will arise in the management of the household. thirdly, and this is the point from which we digressed, the legislator must mold to his will the frames of newly-born [[children]]. almost all these objects may be secured by attention to one point. since the [[time]] of [[generation]] is commonly limited within the [[age]] of seventy years in the case of a [[man]], and of fifty in the case of a woman, the commencement of the union should conform to these periods. the union of male and female when too [[young]] is [[bad]] for the procreation of [[children]]; in all other animals the offspring of the [[young]] are small and in-developed, and with a tendency to [[produce]] female [[children]], and therefore also in [[man]], as is proved by the [[fact]] that in those cities [[city]] in which [[men]] and [[women]] are accustomed to [[marry]] [[young]], the [[people]] are small and [[weak]]; in childbirth also younger [[women]] suffer more, and more of them [[die]]; some persons [[person]] say that this was the meaning of the response once given to the troezenians- the oracle really meant that many died because they [[married]] too [[young]]; it had nothing to do with the ingathering of the harvest. it also conduces to temperance not to [[marry]] too soon; for [[women]] who [[marry]] early are apt to be wanton; and in [[men]] too the bodily frame is stunted if they [[marry]] while the seed is growing (for there is a [[time]] when the [[growth]] of the seed, also, ceases, or continues to but a slight extent). [[women]] should [[marry]] when they are about eighteen years of [[age]], and [[men]] at seven and thirty; then they are in the prime of [[life]], and the decline in the powers [[power]] of both will coincide. further, the [[children]], if their birth takes place soon, as may reasonably be expected, will succeed in the beginning of their prime, when the fathers [[father]] are already in the decline of [[life]], and have nearly reached their term of three-score years and ten. 

thus much of the [[age]] proper for [[marriage]]: the season of the year should also be considered; according to our [[present]] custom, [[people]] generally limit [[marriage]] to the season of winter, and they are [[right]]. the precepts of physicians and [[natural]] [[philosophers]] about [[generation]] should also be [[studied]] by the parents themselves; the physicians give [[good]] [[advice]] about the favorable conditions of the [[body]], and the [[natural]] [[philosophers]] about the winds; of which they prefer the north to the south. 

what [[constitution]] in the parent is most advantageous to the offspring is a [[subject]] which we will consider more carefully when we speak of the [[education]] of [[children]], and we will only make a few general remarks at [[present]]. the [[constitution]] of an athlete is not suited to the [[life]] of a citizen, or to health, or to the procreation of [[children]], any more than the valetudinarian or exhausted [[constitution]], but one which is in a mean between them. a man's [[man]] [[constitution]] should be inured to labor, but not to labor which is excessive or of one sort only, such as is practiced by athletes; he should be capable of all the actions of a freeman. these remarks apply equally to both parents. 

women who are with child should be careful of themselves; they should take exercise and have a nourishing diet. the first of these prescriptions the legislator will easily carry into effect by requiring that they shall take a walk daily to some temple, where they can [[worship]] the gods who preside over birth. their minds [[mind]], however, unlike their bodies [[body]], they ought to keep quiet, for the offspring derive their natures [[nature]] from their mothers [[mother]] as plants do from the [[earth]]. 

as to the exposure and rearing of [[children]], let there be a [[law]] that no deformed child shall [[live]], but that on the ground of an excess in the number of [[children]], if the established customs of the [[state]] forbid this (for in our [[state]] [[population]] has a limit), no child is to be exposed, but when couples have [[children]] in excess, let abortion be procured before sense and [[life]] have begun; what may or may not be lawfully done in these cases depends on the [[question]] of [[life]] and sensation. 

and now, having determined at what ages [[age]] [[men]] and [[women]] are to begin their union, let us also determine how long they shall continue to beget and bear offspring for the [[state]]; [[men]] who are too old, like [[men]] who are too [[young]], [[produce]] [[children]] who are defective in [[body]] and [[mind]]; the [[children]] of very old [[men]] are weakly. the limit then, should be the [[age]] which is the prime of their [[intelligence]], and this in most persons [[person]], according to the notion of some poets who measure [[life]] by periods of seven years, is about fifty; at four or five years or later, they should cease from having families [[family]]; and from that [[time]] forward only cohabit with one another for the sake of health; or for some similar [[reason]]. 

as to adultery, let it be held disgraceful, in general, for any [[man]] or woman to be found in any way unfaithful when they are [[married]], and called husband and [[wife]]. if during the [[time]] of bearing [[children]] anything of the sort occur, let the guilty [[person]] be punished with a loss of privileges [[privilege]] in proportion to the offense. 

part xvii 

after the [[children]] have been born, the manner of rearing them may be supposed to have a [[great]] effect on their bodily [[strength]]. it would appear from the [[example]] of animals, and of those nations who [[desire]] to create the [[military]] habit, that the food which has most milk in it is [[best]] suited to [[human]] beings; but the less wine the [[better]], if they would escape diseases. also all the motions to which [[children]] can be subjected at their early [[age]] are very useful. but in order to preserve their tender limbs from distortion, some nations have had recourse to mechanical appliances which straighten their bodies [[body]]. to accustom [[children]] to the cold from their earliest years is also an excellent practice, which greatly conduces to health, and hardens them for [[military]] service. hence many barbarians have a custom of plunging their [[children]] at birth into a cold stream; others, like the celts, clothe them in a [[light]] wrapper only. for [[human]] [[nature]] should be early habituated to endure all which by habit it can be made to endure; but the process must be gradual. and [[children]], from their [[natural]] warmth, may be easily trained to bear cold. such [[care]] should attend them in the first stage of [[life]]. 

the next period lasts to the [[age]] of five; during this no demand should be made upon the child for study or labor, lest its [[growth]] be impeded; and there should be sufficient motion to prevent the limbs from being inactive. this can be secured, among other ways, by amusement, but the amusement should not be vulgar or tiring or effeminate. the directors of [[education]], as they are termed, should be careful what tales or stories the [[children]] hear, for all such things are designed to prepare the way for the [[business]] of later [[life]], and should be for the most part imitations of the occupations which they will hereafter pursue in earnest. those are [[wrong]] who in their laws [[law]] attempt to check the loud crying and screaming of [[children]], for these contribute towards their [[growth]], and, in a manner, exercise their bodies [[body]]. straining the voice has a strengthening effect similar to that produced by the retention of the breath in [[violent]] exertions. the directors of [[education]] should have an eye to their bringing up, and in particular should take [[care]] that they are left as little as possible with slaves [[slave]]. for until they are seven years old they must five at [[home]]; and therefore, even at this early [[age]], it is to be expected that they should acquire a taint of meanness from what they hear and see. indeed, there is nothing which the legislator should be more careful to drive away than indecency of [[speech]]; for the [[light]] utterance of shameful words leads soon to shameful actions. the [[young]] especially should never be allowed to repeat or hear anything of the sort. a freeman who is found saying or doing what is forbidden, if he be too [[young]] as yet to have the [[privilege]] of reclining at the [[public]] tables, should be disgraced and beaten, and an elder [[person]] degraded as his slavish conduct deserves. and since we do not allow improper [[language]], clearly we should also banish pictures or speeches [[speech]] from the stage which are indecent. let the rulers take [[care]] that there be no image or picture representing unseemly actions, except in the temples of those gods at whose festivals the [[law]] permits even ribaldry, and whom the [[law]] also permits to be worshipped by persons [[person]] of mature [[age]] on behalf of themselves, their [[children]], and their wives [[wife]]. but the legislator should not allow [[youth]] to be spectators of iambi or of comedy until they are of an [[age]] to sit at the [[public]] tables and to drink [[strong]] wine; by that [[time]] [[education]] will have armed them against the [[evil]] influences of such representations. 

we have made these remarks in a cursory manner- they are enough for the [[present]] [[occasion]]; but hereafter we will return to the [[subject]] and after a fuller discussion determine whether such [[liberty]] should or should not be granted, and in what way granted, if at all. theodorus, the tragic actor, was quite [[right]] in saying that he would not allow any other actor, not even if he were quite second-rate, to enter before himself, because the spectators grew fond of the voices which they first heard. and the same [[principle]] applies universally to association with things as well as with persons [[person]], for we always like [[best]] whatever comes first. and therefore [[youth]] should be kept strangers to all that is [[bad]], and especially to things which suggest [[vice]] or hate. when the five years have passed away, during the two following years they must look on at the pursuits which they are hereafter to learn. there are two periods of [[life]] with reference to which [[education]] has to be divided, from seven to the [[age]] of puberty, and onwards to the [[age]] of one and twenty. the poets who divide ages [[age]] by sevens are in the main [[right]]: but we should observe the divisions actually made by [[nature]]; for the deficiencies of [[nature]] are what art [[arts]] and [[education]] seek to fill up. 

let us then first inquire if any regulations are to be laid down about [[children]], and secondly, whether the [[care]] of them should be the concern of the [[state]] or of private individuals [[individual]], which latter is in our own day the [[common]] custom, and in the third place, what these regulations should be. 

book eight	   

part i 

no ne will [[doubt]] that the legislator should direct his attention above all to the [[education]] of [[youth]]; for the neglect of [[education]] does harm to the [[constitution]] the citizen should be molded to suit the form of [[government]] under which he lives [[life]]. for each [[government]] has a peculiar [[character]] which originally formed and which continues to preserve it. the [[character]] of [[democracy]] creates [[democracy]], and the [[character]] of [[oligarchy]] creates [[oligarchy]]; and always the [[better]] the [[character]], the [[better]] the [[government]]. 

again, for the exercise of any faculty or art [[arts]] a previous training and habituation are required; clearly therefore for the practice of [[virtue]]. and since the whole [[city]] has one end, it is manifest that [[education]] should be one and the same for all, and that it should be [[public]], and not private- not as at [[present]], when every one looks after his own [[children]] separately, and gives them separate instruction of the sort which he thinks [[think]] [[best]]; the training in things which are of [[common]] interest should be the same for all. neither must we suppose that any one of the [[citizens]] belongs to himself, for they all belong to the [[state]], and are each of them a part of the [[state]], and the [[care]] of each part is inseparable from the [[care]] of the whole. in this particular as in some others the lacedaemonians are to be praised, for they take the [[greatest]] pains [[pain]] about their [[children]], and make [[education]] the [[business]] of the [[state]]. 

part ii 

that [[education]] should be regulated by [[law]] and should be an affair of [[state]] is not to be denied, but what should be the [[character]] of this [[public]] [[education]], and how [[young]] persons [[person]] should be educated, are questions [[question]] which remain to be considered. as things are, there is disagreement about the subjects [[subject]]. for [[mankind]] are by no means agreed about the things to be taught, whether we look to [[virtue]] or the [[best]] [[life]]. neither is it clear whether [[education]] is more concerned with intellectual or with [[moral]] [[virtue]]. the existing practice is perplexing; no one knows [[know]] on what [[principle]] we should proceed- should the useful in [[life]], or should [[virtue]], or should the higher [[knowledge]], be the aim of our training; all three opinions [[opinion]] have been entertained. again, about the means there is no agreement; for different persons [[person]], starting with different ideas [[idea]] about the [[nature]] of [[virtue]], naturally disagree about the practice of it. there can be no [[doubt]] that [[children]] should be taught those useful things which are really necessary, but not all useful things; for occupations are divided into liberal and illiberal; and to [[young]] [[children]] should be imparted only such kinds [[kind]] of [[knowledge]] as will be useful to them without vulgarizing them. and any occupation, art [[arts]], or [[science]], which makes the [[body]] or [[soul]] or [[mind]] of the freeman less fit for the practice or exercise of [[virtue]], is vulgar; wherefore we call those [[arts]] vulgar which tend to deform the [[body]], and likewise all paid employments, for they absorb and degrade the [[mind]]. there are also some liberal [[arts]] quite proper for a freeman to acquire, but only in a [[certain]] [[degree]], and if he attend to them too closely, in order to attain [[perfection]] in them, the same [[evil]] effects will [[follow]]. the object also which a [[man]] sets before him makes a [[great]] difference; if he does or learns anything for his own sake or for the sake of his [[friends]], or with a view to excellence the action will not appear illiberal; but if done for the sake of others, the very same action will be [[thought]] menial and servile. the received subjects [[subject]] of instruction, as i have already remarked, are partly of a liberal and party of an illiberal [[character]].

the customary branches of [[education]] are in number four; they are- (1) reading and writing, (2) gymnastic exercises, (3) [[music]], to which is sometimes added (4) drawing. of these, reading and writing and drawing are regarded as useful for the purposes [[purpose]] of [[life]] in a variety of ways, and gymnastic exercises are [[thought]] to infuse [[courage]]. concerning [[music]] a [[doubt]] may be raised- in our own day most [[men]] cultivate it for the sake of [[pleasure]], but originally it was included in [[education]], because [[nature]] herself, as has been often said, requires that we should be able, not only to [[work]] well, but to use leisure well; for, as i must repeat once again, the first [[principle]] of all action is leisure. both are required, but leisure is [[better]] than occupation and is its end; and therefore the [[question]] must be [[asked]], what ought we to do when at leisure? clearly we ought not to be amusing ourselves, for then amusement would be the end of [[life]]. but if this is inconceivable, and amusement is needed more amid serious occupations than at other times [[time]] (for he who is hard at [[work]] has need of relaxation, and amusement gives relaxation, whereas occupation is always accompanied with exertion and effort), we should introduce amusements only at suitable times [[time]], and they should be our medicines, for the emotion which they create in the [[soul]] is a relaxation, and from the [[pleasure]] we obtain rest. but leisure of itself gives [[pleasure]] and [[happiness]] and enjoyment of [[life]], which are experienced, not by the busy [[man]], but by those who have leisure. for he who is occupied has in view some end which he has not attained; but [[happiness]] is an end, since all [[men]] deem it to be accompanied with [[pleasure]] and not with [[pain]]. this [[pleasure]], however, is regarded differently by different persons [[person]], and varies according to the habit of individuals [[individual]]; the [[pleasure]] of the [[best]] [[man]] is the [[best]], and springs from the noblest sources. it is clear then that there are branches of learning and [[education]] which we must study merely with a view to leisure spent in intellectual activity, and these are to be valued for their own sake; whereas those kinds [[kind]] of [[knowledge]] which are useful in [[business]] are to be deemed necessary, and [[exist]] for the sake of other things. and therefore our fathers [[father]] admitted [[music]] into [[education]], not on the ground either of its necessity or utility, for it is not necessary, nor indeed useful in the same manner as reading and writing, which are useful in money-making, in the management of a household, in the acquisition of [[knowledge]] and in [[political]] [[life]], nor like drawing, useful for a more [[correct]] [[judgment]] of the works [[work]] of artists, nor again like gymnastic, which gives health and [[strength]]; for neither of these is to be gained from [[music]]. there remains, then, the use of [[music]] for intellectual enjoyment in leisure; which is in [[fact]] evidently the [[reason]] of its introduction, this being one of the ways in which it is [[thought]] that a freeman should pass his leisure; as [[homer]] says, 

"but he who alone should be called to the pleasant feast, "

and afterwards he speaks of others whom he describes as inviting 

"the bard who would delight them all. "

and in another place odysseus says there is no [[better]] way of passing [[life]] than when men's hearts [[heart]] are merry and 

the banqueters in the hall, sitting in order, hear the voice of the minstrel. 

it is evident, then, that there is a sort of [[education]] in which parents should train their sons [[son]], not as being useful or necessary, but because it is liberal or [[noble]]. whether this is of one [[kind]] only, or of more than one, and if so, what they are, and how they are to be imparted, must hereafter be determined. thus much we are now in a position to say, that the ancients witness to us; for their [[opinion]] may be gathered from the [[fact]] that [[music]] is one of the received and traditional branches of [[education]]. further, it is clear that [[children]] should be instructed in some useful things- for [[example]], in reading and writing- not only for their usefulness, but also because many other sorts of [[knowledge]] are acquired through them. with a like view they may be taught drawing, not to prevent their making mistakes in their own purchases, or in order that they may not be imposed upon in the buying or selling of articles, but perhaps rather because it makes them judges [[judge]] of the [[beauty]] of the [[human]] form. to be always seeking after the useful does not become [[free]] and exalted souls [[soul]]. now it is clear that in [[education]] practice must be used before theory, and the [[body]] be trained before the [[mind]]; and therefore boys should be handed over to the trainer, who creates in them the roper habit of [[body]], and to the wrestling-master, who teaches [[teach]] them their exercises. 

part iv 

of those states which in our own day seem to take the [[greatest]] [[care]] of [[children]], some aim at producing in them an athletic habit, but they only injure their forms and stunt their [[growth]]. although the lacedaemonians have not fallen into this mistake, yet they brutalize their [[children]] by laborious exercises which they [[think]] will make them courageous. but in [[truth]], as we have often repeated, [[education]] should not be exclusively, or principally, directed to this end. and even if we suppose the lacedaemonians to be [[right]] in their end, they do not attain it. for among barbarians and among animals [[courage]] is found associated, not with the [[greatest]] ferocity, but with a gentle and lion like temper. there are many races [[race]] who are ready enough to kill and [[eat]] [[men]], such as the achaeans and heniochi, who both [[live]] about the black sea; and there are other mainland tribes, as [[bad]] or worse, who all [[live]] by plunder, but have no [[courage]]. it is notorious that the lacedaemonians themselves, while they alone were assiduous in their laborious drill, were superior to others, but now they are beaten both in [[war]] and gymnastic exercises. for their ancient superiority did not depend on their mode of training their [[youth]], but only on the circumstance that they trained them when their only rivals did not. hence we may infer that what is [[noble]], not what is brutal, should have the first place; no wolf or other wild animal will face a really [[noble]] danger; such dangers are for the brave [[man]]. and parents who devote their [[children]] to gymnastics while they neglect their necessary [[education]], in reality vulgarize them; for they make them useful to the art [[arts]] of statesmanship in one quality only, and even in this the argument proves them to be inferior to others. we should [[judge]] the lacedaemonians not from what they have been, but from what they are; for now they have rivals who compete with their [[education]]; formerly they had none. 

it is an admitted [[principle]], that gymnastic exercises should be employed in [[education]], and that for [[children]] they should be of a lighter [[kind]], avoiding severe diet or painful toil, lest the [[growth]] of the [[body]] be impaired. the [[evil]] of excessive training in early years is strikingly proved by the [[example]] of the olympic victors; for not more than two or three of them have gained a prize both as boys and as [[men]]; their early training and severe gymnastic exercises exhausted their constitutions [[constitution]]. when boyhood is over, three years should be spent in other studies; the period of [[life]] which follows may then be devoted to hard exercise and strict diet. [[men]] ought not to labor at the same [[time]] with their minds [[mind]] and with their bodies [[body]]; for the two kinds [[kind]] of labor are opposed to one another; the labor of the [[body]] impedes the [[mind]], and the labor of the [[mind]] the [[body]]. 

part v 

concerning [[music]] there are some questions [[question]] which we have already raised; these we may now resume and carry further; and our remarks will serve as a prelude to this or any other discussion of the [[subject]]. it is not easy to determine the [[nature]] of [[music]], or why any one should have a [[knowledge]] of it. shall we say, for the sake of amusement and relaxation, like sleep or drinking, which are not [[good]] in themselves, but are pleasant, and at the same [[time]] 'care to cease,' as euripides says? and for this end [[men]] also appoint [[music]], and make use of all three alike- sleep, drinking, music- to which some add dancing. or shall we argue that [[music]] conduces to [[virtue]], on the ground that it can form our minds [[mind]] and habituate us to true pleasures [[pleasure]] as our bodies [[body]] are made by gymnastic to be of a [[certain]] [[character]]? or shall we say that it contributes to the enjoyment of leisure and mental cultivation, which is a third alternative? now obviously youths [[youth]] are not to be instructed with a view to their amusement, for learning is no amusement, but is accompanied with [[pain]]. neither is intellectual enjoyment suitable to boys of that [[age]], for it is the end, and that which is imperfect cannot attain the [[perfect]] or end. but perhaps it may be said that boys learn [[music]] for the sake of the amusement which they will have when they are grown up. if so, why should they learn themselves, and not, like the persian and median kings [[king]], enjoy the [[pleasure]] and instruction which is derived from hearing others? (for surely persons [[person]] who have made [[music]] the [[business]] and profession of their lives [[life]] will be [[better]] performers than those who practice only long enough to learn). if they must learn [[music]], on the same [[principle]] they should learn cookery, which is absurd. and even granting that [[music]] may form the [[character]], the objection still holds: why should we learn ourselves? why cannot we attain true [[pleasure]] and form a [[correct]] [[judgment]] from hearing others, like the lacedaemonians?- for they, without learning [[music]], nevertheless can correctly [[judge]], as they say, of [[good]] and [[bad]] melodies. or again, if [[music]] should be used to promote cheerfulness and refined intellectual enjoyment, the objection still remains- why should we learn ourselves instead of enjoying the performances of others? we may illustrate what we are saying by our conception of the gods; for in the poets [[zeus]] does not himself sing or play on the lyre. nay, we call professional performers vulgar; no freeman would play or sing unless he were intoxicated or in jest. but these matters may be left for the [[present]]. 

the first [[question]] is whether [[music]] is or is not to be a part of [[education]]. of the three things mentioned in our discussion, which does it [[produce]]?- [[education]] or amusement or intellectual enjoyment, for it may be reckoned under all three, and seems to share in the [[nature]] of all of them. amusement is for the sake of relaxation, and relaxation is of necessity sweet, for it is the remedy of [[pain]] caused by toil; and intellectual enjoyment is universally acknowledged to contain an element not only of the [[noble]] but of the pleasant, for [[happiness]] is made up of both. all [[men]] agree that [[music]] is one of the pleasantest things, whether with or without songs [[song]]; as musaeus says: 

"song to mortals of all things the sweetest. "

hence and with [[good]] [[reason]] it is introduced into social gatherings and entertainments, because it makes the hearts [[heart]] of [[men]] glad: so that on this ground alone we may assume that the [[young]] ought to be trained in it. for [[innocent]] pleasures [[pleasure]] are not only in harmony with the [[perfect]] end of [[life]], but they also provide relaxation. and whereas [[men]] rarely attain the end, but often rest by the way and amuse themselves, not only with a view to a further end, but also for the pleasure's sake, it may be well at times [[time]] to let them find a refreshment in [[music]]. it sometimes happens that [[men]] make amusement the end, for the end probably contains some element of [[pleasure]], though not any ordinary or lower [[pleasure]]; but they mistake the lower for the higher, and in seeking for the one find the other, since every [[pleasure]] has a likeness to the end of action. for the end is not eligible for the sake of any future [[good]], nor do the pleasures [[pleasure]] which we have described [[exist]] for the sake of any future [[good]] but of the [[past]], that is to say, they are the alleviation of [[past]] toils and pains [[pain]]. and we may infer this to be the [[reason]] why [[men]] seek [[happiness]] from these pleasures [[pleasure]]. 

but [[music]] is pursued, not only as an alleviation of [[past]] toil, but also as providing recreation. and who can say whether, having this use, it may not also have a nobler one? in addition to this [[common]] [[pleasure]], [[felt]] and shared in by all (for the [[pleasure]] given by [[music]] is [[natural]], and therefore adapted to all ages [[age]] and characters), may it not have also some influence over the [[character]] and the [[soul]]? it must have such an influence if characters [[character]] are affected by it. and that they are so affected is proved in many ways, and not least by the [[power]] which the songs [[song]] of [[olympus]] exercise; for beyond [[question]] they inspire enthusiasm, and enthusiasm is an emotion of the ethical part of the [[soul]]. besides, when [[men]] hear imitations, even apart from the rhythms and tunes themselves, their feelings move in sympathy. since then [[music]] is a [[pleasure]], and [[virtue]] consists in rejoicing and loving and hating aright, there is clearly nothing which we are so much concerned to acquire and to cultivate as the [[power]] of forming [[right]] judgments [[judgment]], and of taking delight in [[good]] dispositions and [[noble]] actions. rhythm and melody supply imitations of anger and gentleness, and also of [[courage]] and temperance, and of all the qualities contrary to these, and of the other qualities of [[character]], which hardly fall short of the actual affections, as we [[know]] from our own [[experience]], for in listening to such strains our souls [[soul]] undergo a [[change]]. the habit of feeling [[pleasure]] or [[pain]] at mere representations is not far removed from the same feeling about realities; for [[example]], if any one delights in the sight of a statue for its [[beauty]] only, it necessarily follows that the sight of the original will be pleasant to him. the objects of no other sense, such as taste or touch, have any resemblance to [[moral]] qualities; in visible objects there is only a little, for there are figures which are of a [[moral]] [[character]], but only to a slight extent, and all do not participate in the feeling about them. again, figures and colors are not imitations, but signs, of [[moral]] habits, indications which the [[body]] gives of states of feeling. the connection of them with morals [[moral]] is slight, but in so far as there is any, [[young]] [[men]] should be taught to look, not at the works [[work]] of pauson, but at those of polygnotus, or any other painter or sculptor who expresses [[moral]] ideas [[idea]]. on the other hand, even in mere melodies there is an imitation of [[character]], for the musical modes differ essentially from one another, and those who hear them are differently affected by each. some of them make [[men]] [[sad]] and grave, like the so-called mixolydian, others enfeeble the [[mind]], like the relaxed modes, another, again, produces [[produce]] a moderate and settled temper, which appears to be the peculiar effect of the dorian; the phrygian inspires enthusiasm. the whole [[subject]] has been well treated by philosophical writers on this branch of [[education]], and they confirm their arguments by facts [[fact]]. the same principles [[principle]] apply to rhythms; some have a [[character]] of rest, others of motion, and of these latter again, some have a more vulgar, others a nobler movement. enough has been said to show that [[music]] has a [[power]] of forming the [[character]], and should therefore be introduced into the [[education]] of the [[young]]. the study is suited to the stage of [[youth]], for [[young]] persons [[person]] will not, if they can [[help]], endure anything which is not sweetened by [[pleasure]], and [[music]] has a [[natural]] sweetness. there seems to be in us a sort of affinity to musical modes and rhythms, which makes some [[philosophers]] say that the [[soul]] is a tuning, others, that it possesses tuning. 

part vi 

and now we have to determine the [[question]] which has been already raised, whether [[children]] should be themselves taught to sing and play or not. clearly there is a considerable difference made in the [[character]] by the actual practice of the art [[arts]]. it is difficult, if not impossible, for those who do not perform to be [[good]] judges [[judge]] of the performance of others. besides, [[children]] should have something to do, and the rattle of archytas, which [[people]] give to their [[children]] in order to amuse them and prevent them from breaking anything in the house, was a [[capital]] invention, for a [[young]] thing cannot be quiet. the rattle is a toy suited to the infant [[mind]], and [[education]] is a rattle or toy for [[children]] of a larger [[growth]]. we conclude then that they should be taught [[music]] in such a way as to become not only critics but performers. 

the [[question]] what is or is not suitable for different ages [[age]] may be easily answered; nor is there any difficulty in meeting the objection of those who say that the study of [[music]] is vulgar. we reply (1) in the first place, that they who are to be judges [[judge]] must also be performers, and that they should begin to practice early, although when they are older they may be spared the execution; they must have learned to appreciate what is [[good]] and to delight in it, thanks to the [[knowledge]] which they acquired in their [[youth]]. as to (2) the vulgarizing effect which [[music]] is supposed to exercise, this is a [[question]] which we shall have no difficulty in determining, when we have considered to what extent freemen who are being trained to [[political]] [[virtue]] should pursue the art [[arts]], what melodies and what rhythms they should be allowed to use, and what instruments should be employed in teaching them to play; for even the instrument makes a difference. the [[answer]] to the objection turns upon these distinctions; for it is quite possible that [[certain]] methods of teaching and learning [[music]] do really have a degrading effect. it is evident then that the learning of [[music]] ought not to impede the [[business]] of riper years, or to degrade the [[body]] or render it unfit for civil or [[military]] training, whether for bodily exercises at the [[time]] or for later studies. 

the [[right]] measure will be attained if students of [[music]] stop short of the [[arts]] which are practiced in professional contests, and do not seek to acquire those fantastic marvels of execution which are now the [[fashion]] in such contests, and from these have passed into [[education]]. let the [[young]] practice even such [[music]] as we have prescribed, only until they are able to [[feel]] delight in [[noble]] melodies and rhythms, and not merely in that [[common]] part of [[music]] in which every [[slave]] or child and even some animals find [[pleasure]]. 

from these principles [[principle]] we may also infer what instruments should be used. the flute, or any other instrument which requires [[great]] [[skill]], as for [[example]] the harp, ought not to be admitted into [[education]], but only such as will make [[intelligent]] students of [[music]] or of the other parts of [[education]]. besides, the flute is not an instrument which is expressive of [[moral]] [[character]]; it is too exciting. the proper [[time]] for using it is when the performance aims not at instruction, but at the relief of the [[passions]]. and there is a further objection; the impediment which the flute presents [[present]] to the use of the voice detracts from its educational value. the ancients therefore were [[right]] in forbidding the flute to youths [[youth]] and freemen, although they had once allowed it. for when their [[wealth]] gave them a greater inclination to leisure, and they had loftier notions of excellence, being also elated with their [[success]], both before and after the persian [[war]], with more zeal than discernment they pursued every [[kind]] of [[knowledge]], and so they introduced the flute into [[education]]. at lacedaemon there was a choragus who [[led]] the chorus with a flute, and at [[athens]] the instrument became so popular that most freemen could play upon it. the popularity is shown by the tablet which thrasippus dedicated when he furnished the chorus to ecphantides. later [[experience]] enabled [[men]] to [[judge]] what was or was not really conducive to [[virtue]], and they rejected both the flute and several other old-fashioned instruments, such as the lydian harp, the many-stringed lyre, the 'heptagon,' 'triangle,' 'sambuca,' the like- which are intended only to give [[pleasure]] to the hearer, and require extraordinary [[skill]] of hand. there is a meaning also in the myth of the ancients, which tells how athene [[invented]] the flute and then threw it away. it was not a [[bad]] [[idea]] of theirs, that the [[goddess]] disliked the instrument because it made the face ugly; but with still more [[reason]] may we say that she rejected it because the acquirement of flute-playing contributes nothing to the [[mind]], since to athene we ascribe both [[knowledge]] and art [[arts]]. 

thus then we reject the professional instruments and also the professional mode of [[education]] in [[music]] (and by professional we mean that which is adopted in contests), for in this the performer practices the art [[arts]], not for the sake of his own improvement, but in order to give [[pleasure]], and that of a vulgar sort, to his hearers. for this [[reason]] the execution of such [[music]] is not the part of a freeman but of a paid performer, and the result is that the performers are vulgarized, for the end at which they aim is [[bad]]. the vulgarity of the spectator tends to lower the [[character]] of the [[music]] and therefore of the performers; they look to him- he makes them what they are, and fashions even their bodies [[body]] by the movements which he expects them to exhibit. 

part vii 

we have also to consider rhythms and modes, and their use in [[education]]. shall we use them all or make a distinction? and shall the same distinction be made for those who practice [[music]] with a view to [[education]], or shall it be some other? now we see that [[music]] is produced by melody and rhythm, and we ought to [[know]] what influence these have respectively on [[education]], and whether we should prefer excellence in melody or excellence in rhythm. but as the [[subject]] has been very well treated by many musicians of the [[present]] day, and also by [[philosophers]] who have had considerable [[experience]] of musical [[education]], to these we would refer the more exact student of the [[subject]]; we shall only speak of it now after the manner of the legislator, stating the general principles [[principle]]. 

we accept the division of melodies proposed by [[certain]] [[philosophers]] into ethical melodies, melodies of action, and passionate or inspiring melodies, each having, as they say, a mode corresponding to it. but we maintain further that [[music]] should be [[studied]], not for the sake of one, but of many benefits, that is to say, with a view to (1) [[education]], (2) purgation (the word 'purgation' we use at [[present]] without explanation, but when hereafter we speak of poetry, we will treat the [[subject]] with more precision); [[music]] may also serve (3) for for enjoyment, for relaxation, and for recreation after exertion. it is clear, therefore, that all the modes must be employed by us, but not all of them in the same manner. in [[education]] the most ethical modes are to be preferred, but in listening to the performances of others we may admit the modes of action and passion also. for feelings such as [[pity]] and [[fear]], or, again, enthusiasm, [[exist]] very strongly in some souls [[soul]], and have more or less influence over all. some persons [[person]] fall into a [[religious]] frenzy, whom we see as a result of the [[sacred]] melodies- when they have used the melodies that excite the [[soul]] to mystic frenzy- restored as though they had found healing and purgation. those who are influenced by [[pity]] or [[fear]], and every emotional [[nature]], must have a like [[experience]], and others in so far as each is susceptible to such emotions, and all are in a manner purged and their souls [[soul]] lightened and delighted. the purgative melodies likewise give an [[innocent]] [[pleasure]] to [[mankind]]. such are the modes and the melodies in which those who perform [[music]] at the theater should be invited to compete. but since the spectators are of two kinds- the one [[free]] and educated, and the other a vulgar crowd composed of mechanics, laborers, and the like- there ought to be contests and exhibitions instituted for the relaxation of the second class also. and the [[music]] will correspond to their minds [[mind]]; for as their minds [[mind]] are perverted from the [[natural]] [[state]], so there are perverted modes and highly strung and unnaturally colored melodies. a [[man]] receives [[pleasure]] from what is [[natural]] to him, and therefore professional musicians may be allowed to practice this lower sort of [[music]] before an audience of a lower type. but, for the purposes [[purpose]] of [[education]], as i have already said, those modes and melodies should be employed which are ethical, such as the dorian, as we said before; though we may include any others which are approved by [[philosophers]] who have had a musical [[education]]. the [[socrates]] of the [[republic]] is [[wrong]] in retaining only the phrygian mode along with the dorian, and the more so because he rejects the flute; for the phrygian is to the modes what the flute is to musical instruments- both of them are exciting and emotional. poetry proves this, for bacchic frenzy and all similar emotions are most suitably expressed by the flute, and are [[better]] set to the phrygian than to any other mode. the dithyramb, for [[example]], is acknowledged to be phrygian, a [[fact]] of which the connoisseurs of [[music]] offer many proofs, saying, among other things, that philoxenus, having attempted to compose his mysians as a dithyramb in the dorian mode, found it impossible, and fell back by the very [[nature]] of things into the more appropriate phrygian. all [[men]] agree that the dorian [[music]] is the gravest and manliest. and whereas we say that the extremes should be avoided and the mean followed, and whereas the dorian is a mean between the other modes, it is evident that our [[youth]] should be taught the dorian [[music]]. 

two principles [[principle]] have to be kept in view, what is possible, what is becoming: at these every [[man]] ought to aim. but even these are relative to [[age]]; the old, who have lost their powers [[power]], cannot very well sing the high-strung modes, and [[nature]] herself seems to suggest that their songs [[song]] should be of the more relaxed [[kind]]. wherefore the musicians likewise blame [[socrates]], and with [[justice]], for rejecting the relaxed modes in [[education]] under the [[idea]] that they are intoxicating, not in the ordinary sense of intoxication (for wine rather tends to excite men), but because they have no [[strength]] in them. and so, with a view also to the [[time]] of [[life]] when [[men]] begin to grow old, they ought to practice the gentler modes and melodies as well as the others, and, further, any mode, such as the lydian above all others appears to be, which is suited to [[children]] of tender [[age]], and possesses the elements both of order and of [[education]]. thus it is clear that [[education]] should be based upon three principles- the mean, the possible, the becoming, these three.
