preface.

the [[present]] publication is intended to supply a recognised deficiency in
our literature--a library edition of the essays of montaigne.  this great
french writer deserves to be regarded as a classic, not only in the land
of his birth, but in all countries [[country]] and in all literatures.  his essays,
which are at once the most celebrated and the most permanent of his
productions, form a magazine out of which such minds [[mind]] as those of bacon
and shakespeare did not disdain to [[help]] themselves; and, indeed, as
hallam observes, the frenchman’s literary importance largely results from
the share which his [[mind]] had in influencing other minds [[mind]], coeval and
subsequent.  but, at the same [[time]], estimating the value and rank of the
essayist, we are not to leave out of the account the drawbacks and the
circumstances of the period: the imperfect [[state]] of [[education]], the
comparative scarcity of books [[book]], and the limited opportunities of
intellectual intercourse.  montaigne freely borrowed of others, and he
has found [[men]] willing to borrow of him as freely.  we need not wonder at
the [[reputation]] which he with seeming facility achieved.  he was, without
being aware of it, the leader of a new school in letters and morals [[moral]].  his
book was different from all others which were at that date in the [[world]].
it diverted the ancient currents of [[thought]] into new channels.  it told
its readers, with unexampled frankness, what its writer’s [[opinion]] was
about [[men]] and things, and threw what must have been a [[strange]] [[kind]] of new
light on many matters but darkly understood.  above all, the essayist
uncased himself, and made his intellectual and physical organism public
property.  he took the [[world]] into his confidence on all subjects [[subject]].  his
essays were a sort of literary anatomy, where we get a diagnosis of the
writer’s [[mind]], made by himself at different levels and under a large
variety of operating influences.

of all egotists, montaigne, if not the [[greatest]], was the most
fascinating, because, perhaps, he was the least affected and most
truthful.  what he did, and what he had professed to do, was to dissect
his [[mind]], and show us, as [[best]] he could, how it was made, and what
relation it bore to external objects.  he investigated his mental
structure as a schoolboy pulls his watch to pieces, to examine the
mechanism of the works [[work]]; and the result, accompanied by illustrations
abounding with originality and [[force]], he delivered to his fellow-men in a
book.

eloquence, rhetorical effect, poetry, were alike remote from his design.
he did not write from necessity, scarcely perhaps for fame.  but he
desired to leave [[france]], nay, and the [[world]], something to be remembered
by, something which should tell what [[kind]] of a [[man]] he was--what he [[felt]],
thought, suffered--and he succeeded immeasurably, i apprehend, beyond his
expectations.

it was reasonable enough that montaigne should expect for his [[work]] a
certain share of celebrity in gascony, and even, as [[time]] went on,
throughout [[france]]; but it is scarcely probable that he foresaw how his
renown was to become world-wide; how he was to occupy an almost unique
position as a [[man]] of letters and a moralist; how the essays would be
read, in all the principal languages [[language]] of [[europe]], by millions of
intelligent [[human]] beings, who never heard of perigord or the league, and
who are in [[doubt]], if they are questioned, whether the author lived in the
sixteenth or the eighteenth century.  this is true fame.  a [[man]] of genius
belongs to no period and no [[country]].  he speaks the [[language]] of [[nature]],
which is always everywhere the same.

the text of these volumes is taken from the first edition of cotton’s
version, printed in 3 vols.  8vo, 1685-6, and republished in 1693, 1700,
1711, 1738, and 1743, in the same number of volumes and the same size.
in the earliest impression the errors of the press are corrected merely
as far as page 240 of the first volume, and all the editions [[follow]] one
another.  that of 1685-6 was the only one which the translator lived to
see.  he died in 1687, leaving behind him an interesting and little-known
collection of poems, which appeared posthumously, 8vo, 1689.

it was considered imperative to [[correct]] cotton’s translation by a careful
collation with the ‘variorum’ edition of the original, [[paris]], 1854,
4 vols.  8vo or 12mo, and parallel passages from florin’s earlier
undertaking have occasionally been inserted at the foot of the page.  a
life of the author and all his recovered letters, sixteen in number, have
also been given; but, as regards the correspondence, it can scarcely be
doubted that it is in a purely fragmentary [[state]].  to do more than
furnish a sketch of the leading incidents in montaigne’s [[life]] seemed, in
the presence of bayle st. john’s charming and able biography, an attempt
as difficult as it was useless.

the besetting [[sin]] of both montaigne’s translators seems to have been a
propensity for reducing his [[language]] and phraseology to the [[language]] and
phraseology of the [[age]] and [[country]] to which they belonged, and, moreover,
inserting paragraphs and words, not here and there only, but constantly
and habitually, from an evident [[desire]] and view to elucidate or
strengthen their author’s meaning.  the result has generally been
unfortunate; and i have, in the case of all these interpolations on
cotton’s part, [[felt]] bound, where i did not cancel them, to throw them
down into the notes, not thinking it [[right]] that montaigne should be
allowed any longer to stand sponsor for what he never wrote; and
reluctant, on the other hand, to suppress the intruding matter entirely,
where it appeared to possess a value of its own.

nor is redundancy or paraphrase the only form of transgression in cotton,
for there are places in his author which he [[thought]] proper to omit, and
it is hardly necessary to say that the restoration of all such matter to
the text was considered essential to its integrity and completeness.

my warmest thanks are due to my [[father]], mr registrar hazlitt, the author
of the well-known and excellent edition of montaigne published in 1842,
for the important assistance which he has rendered to me in verifying and
retranslating the quotations, which were in a most [[corrupt]] [[state]], and of
which cotton’s english versions were singularly loose and inexact, and
for the zeal with which he has co-operated with me in collating the
english text, line for line and word for word, with the [[best]] french
edition.

by the favour of mr f. w. cosens, i have had by me, while at [[work]] on this
subject, the copy of cotgrave’s dictionary, folio, 1650, which belonged
to cotton.  it has his autograph and copious mss.  notes, nor is it too
much to presume that it is the very [[book]] employed by him in his
translation.

                         the [[life]] of montaigne

[this is translated freely from that prefixed to the ‘variorum’ paris
edition, 1854, 4 vols.  8vo.  this biography is the more desirable that
it contains all really interesting and important matter in the journal of
the tour in germany and [[italy]], which, as it was merely written under
montaigne’s dictation, is in the third [[person]], is scarcely worth
publication, as a whole, in an english dress.]


the author of the essays was born, as he informs us himself, between
eleven and twelve o’clock in the day, the [[last]] of february 1533, at the
chateau of st. michel de montaigne.  his [[father]], pierre eyquem, esquire,
was successively first jurat of the town of bordeaux (1530), under-mayor
1536, jurat for the second [[time]] in 1540, procureur in 1546, and at
length mayor from 1553 to 1556.  he was a [[man]] of austere probity, who had
“a particular regard for [[honour]] and for propriety in his [[person]] and
attire .  .  .   a mighty [[good]] [[faith]] in his [[speech]], and a [[conscience]] and
a [[religious]] feeling inclining to superstition, rather than to the other
extreme.” [essays, ii. 2.]  pierre eyquem bestowed [[great]] [[care]] on the
education of his [[children]], especially on the practical side of it.  to
associate closely his [[son]] michel with the [[people]], and attach him to those
who stand in need of assistance, he caused him to be held at the font by
persons of meanest position; subsequently he put him out to nurse with a
poor villager, and then, at a later period, made him accustom himself to
the most [[common]] sort of living, taking [[care]], nevertheless, to cultivate
his [[mind]], and superintend its [[development]] without the exercise of undue
rigour or constraint.  michel, who gives us the minutest account of his
earliest years, charmingly narrates how they used to awake him by the
sound of some agreeable [[music]], and how he learned latin, without
suffering the rod or shedding a tear, before beginning french, thanks to
the [[german]] teacher whom his [[father]] had placed near him, and who never
addressed him except in the [[language]] of [[virgil]] and cicero.  the study of
greek took precedence.  at six years of [[age]] [[young]] montaigne went to the
college of guienne at bordeaux, where he had as preceptors the most
eminent scholars of the sixteenth century, nicolas grouchy, guerente,
muret, and buchanan.  at thirteen he had passed through all the classes,
and as he was destined for the [[law]] he left school to study that [[science]].
he was then about fourteen, but these early years of his [[life]] are
involved in obscurity.  the next information that we have is that in 1554
he received the appointment of councillor in the [[parliament]] of bordeaux;
in 1559 he was at bar-le-duc with the court of francis ii, and in the
year following he was [[present]] at rouen to witness the declaration of the
majority of charles ix.  we do not [[know]] in what manner he was engaged on
these occasions [[occasion]].

between 1556 and 1563 an important incident occurred in the [[life]] of
montaigne, in the commencement of his romantic [[friendship]] with etienne de
la boetie, whom he had met, as he tells us, by pure [[chance]] at some
festive celebration in the town.  from their very first interview the two
found themselves drawn irresistibly close to one another, and during six
years this [[alliance]] was foremost in the [[heart]] of montaigne, as it was
afterwards in his memory, when [[death]] had severed it.

although he blames severely in his own [[book]] [essays, i.  27.] those who,
contrary to the [[opinion]] of [[aristotle]], [[marry]] before five-and-thirty,
montaigne did not wait for the period fixed by the philosopher of
stagyra, but in 1566, in his thirty-third year, he espoused francoise de
chassaigne, [[daughter]] of a councillor in the [[parliament]] of bordeaux.  the
history of his early [[married]] [[life]] vies in obscurity with that of his
youth.  his biographers are not agreed among themselves; and in the
same [[degree]] that he lays open to our view all that concerns his secret
thoughts, the innermost mechanism of his [[mind]], he observes too much
reticence in [[respect]] to his [[public]] functions and conduct, and his social
relations.  the title of gentleman in ordinary to the [[king]], which he
assumes, in a preface, and which henry ii.  gives him in a letter, which
we print a little farther on; what he says as to the commotions of
courts, where he passed a portion of his [[life]]; the instructions which he
wrote under the dictation of catherine de medici for [[king]] charles ix.,
and his [[noble]] correspondence with henry iv., leave no [[doubt]], however, as
to the part which he played in the transactions of those times [[time]], and we
find an unanswerable proof of the esteem in which he was held by the most
exalted personages, in a letter which was addressed to him by charles at
the [[time]] he was admitted to the order of st. michael, which was, as he
informs us himself, the highest [[honour]] of the french noblesse.

according to lacroix du maine, montaigne, upon the [[death]] of his eldest
brother, resigned his post of councillor, in order to adopt the military
profession, while, if we might credit the president bouhier, he never
discharged any functions connected with arms.  however, several passages
in the essays seem to indicate that he not only took service, but that he
was actually in numerous campaigns with the catholic armies [[army]].  let us add,
that on his monument he is represented in a coat of mail, with his casque
and gauntlets on his [[right]] side, and a lion at his feet, all which
signifies, in the [[language]] of [[funeral]] emblems, that the departed has been
engaged in some important [[military]] transactions.

however it may be as to these conjectures, our author, having arrived at
his thirty-eighth year, resolved to dedicate to study and contemplation
the remaining term of his [[life]]; and on his birthday, the [[last]] of february
1571, he caused a philosophical inscription, in latin, to be placed upon
one of the walls of his chateau, where it is still to be seen, and of
which the translation is to this effect:--“in the year of [[christ]] .  .  .
in his thirty-eighth year, on the eve of the calends of march, his
birthday, michel montaigne, already weary of court employments and public
honours, withdrew himself entirely into the converse of the learned
virgins where he intends to spend the remaining moiety of the to allotted
to him in tranquil seclusion.”

at the [[time]] to which we have come, montaigne was unknown to the [[world]] of
letters, except as a translator and editor.  in 1569 he had published a
translation of the “natural theology” of raymond de sebonde, which he had
solely undertaken to please his [[father]].  in 1571 he had caused to be
printed at [[paris]] [[certain]] ‘opuscucla’ of etienne de la boetie; and these
two efforts, inspired in one case by filial [[duty]], and in the other by
friendship, prove that affectionate motives overruled with him mere
personal [[ambition]] as a literary [[man]].  we may suppose that he began to
compose the essays at the very outset of his retirement from public
engagements; for as, according to his own account, observes the president
bouhier, he cared neither for the chase, nor building, nor gardening, nor
agricultural pursuits, and was exclusively occupied with reading and
reflection, he devoted himself with satisfaction to the task of setting
down his thoughts [[thought]] just as they occurred to him.  those thoughts [[thought]] became a
book, and the first part of that [[book]], which was to confer immortality on
the writer, appeared at bordeaux in 1580.  montaigne was then
fifty-seven; he had [[suffered]] for some years [[past]] from renal colic and
gravel; and it was with the necessity of distraction from his [[pain]], and
the [[hope]] of deriving relief from the waters, that he undertook at this
time a [[great]] [[journey]].  as the account which he has left of his travels in
germany and [[italy]] comprises some highly interesting particulars of his
life and personal [[history]], it seems worth while to furnish a sketch or
analysis of it.

“the [[journey]], of which we proceed to describe the course simply,” says
the editor of the itinerary, “had, from beaumont-sur-oise to plombieres,
in lorraine, nothing sufficiently interesting to detain us .  .  .  we
must go as far, as basle, of which we have a description, acquainting us
with its physical and [[political]] condition at that period, as well as with
the [[character]] of its baths.  the passage of montaigne through switzerland
is not without interest, as we see there how our philosophical traveller
accommodated himself everywhere to the ways of the [[country]].  the hotels,
the provisions, the swiss cookery, everything, was agreeable to him; it
appears, indeed, as if he preferred to the french manners and tastes
those of the places he was visiting, and of which the simplicity and
freedom (or frankness) accorded more with his own mode of [[life]] and
thinking.  in the towns where he stayed, montaigne took [[care]] to see the
protestant divines, to make himself conversant with all their dogmas.  he
even had disputations with them occasionally.

“having left switzerland he went to isne, an imperial then on to augsburg
and munich.  he afterwards proceeded to the tyrol, where he was agreeably
surprised, after the warnings which he had received, at the very slight
inconveniences which he [[suffered]], which gave him [[occasion]] to remark that
he had all his [[life]] distrusted the statements of others respecting
foreign countries [[country]], each person’s tastes being according to the notions of
his native place; and that he had consequently set very little on what he
was told beforehand.

“upon his arrival at botzen, montaigne wrote to francois hottmann, to say
that he had been so pleased with his visit to germany that he quitted it
with [[great]] regret, although it was to go into [[italy]].  he then passed
through brunsol, trent, where he put up at the rose; thence going to
rovera; and here he first lamented the scarcity of crawfish, but made up
for the loss by partaking of truffles cooked in [[oil]] and vinegar; oranges,
citrons, and olives, in all of which he delighted.”

after passing a restless night, when he bethought himself in the morning
that there was some new town or district to be seen, he rose, we are
told, with alacrity and [[pleasure]].

his secretary, to whom he dictated his journal, assures us that he never
saw him take so much interest in surrounding scenes and persons [[person]], and
believes that the complete [[change]] helped to mitigate his sufferings in
concentrating his attention on other points.  when there was a complaint
made that he had [[led]] his party out of the beaten route, and then returned
very near the spot from which they started, his [[answer]] was that he had no
settled course, and that he merely proposed to himself to [[pay]] visits to
places which he had not seen, and so long as they could not convict him
of traversing the same path twice, or revisiting a point already seen, he
could perceive no harm in his plan.  as to [[rome]], he cared less to go
there, inasmuch as everybody went there; and he said that he never had a
lacquey who could not tell him all about florence or ferrara.  he also
would say that he seemed to himself like those who are reading some
pleasant story or some fine [[book]], of which they [[fear]] to come to the end:
he [[felt]] so much [[pleasure]] in travelling that he dreaded the moment of
arrival at the place where they were to stop for the night.

we see that montaigne travelled, just as he wrote, completely at his
ease, and without the least constraint, turning, just as he fancied, from
the [[common]] or ordinary roads taken by tourists.  the [[good]] inns, the soft
beds, the fine views, attracted his notice at every point, and in his
observations on [[men]] and things he confines himself chiefly to the
practical side.  the consideration of his health was constantly before
him, and it was in consequence of this that, while at venice, which
disappointed him, he took [[occasion]] to note, for the benefit of readers,
that he had an attack of colic, and that he evacuated two large stones
after supper.  on quitting venice, he went in succession to ferrara,
rovigo, padua, bologna (where he had a stomach-ache), florence, &c.; and
everywhere, before alighting, he made it a [[rule]] to send some of his
servants to ascertain where the [[best]] accommodation was to be had.  he
pronounced the florentine [[women]] the finest in the [[world]], but had not an
equally [[good]] [[opinion]] of the food, which was less plentiful than in
germany, and not so well served.  he lets us [[understand]] that in italy
they send up dishes without dressing, but in germany they were much
better seasoned, and served with a variety of sauces and gravies.  he
remarked further, that the glasses were singularly small and the wines
insipid.

after dining with the grand-duke of florence, montaigne passed rapidly
over the intermediate [[country]], which had no fascination for him, and
arrived at [[rome]] on the [[last]] day of november, entering by the porta del
popolo, and putting up at bear.  but he afterwards hired, at twenty
crowns a month, fine furnished rooms in the house of a spaniard, who
included in these terms the use of the kitchen [[fire]].  what most annoyed
him in the eternal [[city]] was the number of frenchmen he met, who all
saluted him in his native tongue; but otherwise he was very comfortable,
and his stay extended to five months.  a [[mind]] like his, full of grand
classical reflections, could not fail to be profoundly impressed in the
presence of the ruins at [[rome]], and he has enshrined in a magnificent
passage of the journal the feelings of the moment: “he said,” writes his
secretary, “that at [[rome]] one saw nothing but the [[sky]] under which she had
been built, and the outline of her site: that the [[knowledge]] we had of her
was abstract, contemplative, not palpable to the actual senses: that
those who said they beheld at least the ruins of [[rome]], went too far, for
the ruins of so gigantic a structure must have commanded greater
reverence-it was nothing but her sepulchre.  the [[world]], [[jealous]] of her,
prolonged [[empire]], had in the first place broken to pieces that admirable
body, and then, when they perceived that the remains attracted worship
and awe, had buried the very wreck itself.--[compare a passage in one
of horace walpole’s letters to richard west, 22 march 1740 (cunningham’s
edit.  i.  41), where walpole, speaking of [[rome]], describes her very ruins
as ruined.]--as to those small fragments which were still to be seen on
the surface, notwithstanding the assaults of [[time]] and all other attacks,
again and again repeated, they had been favoured by [[fortune]] to be some
slight evidence of that infinite grandeur which nothing could entirely
extingish.  but it was likely that these disfigured remains were the
least entitled to attention, and that the enemies [[enemy]] of that immortal
renown, in their fury, had addressed themselves in the first instance to
the destruction of what was most beautiful and worthiest of preservation;
and that the buildings of this bastard [[rome]], raised upon the ancient
productions, although they might excite the admiration of the present
age, reminded him of the crows’ and sparrows’ nests built in the walls
and arches of the old churches [[church]], destroyed by the huguenots.  again, he
was apprehensive, seeing the space which this grave occupied, that the
whole might not have been recovered, and that the burial itself had been
buried.  and, moreover, to see a wretched heap of rubbish, as pieces of
tile and pottery, grow (as it had ages [[age]] since) to a height [[equal]] to that
of mount gurson,--[in perigord.]--and thrice the width of it, appeared to
show a conspiracy of [[destiny]] against the [[glory]] and pre-eminence of that
city, affording at the same [[time]] a novel and extraordinary proof of its
departed greatness.  he (montaigne) observed that it was difficult to
believe considering the limited area taken up by any of her seven hills
and particularly the two most favoured ones, the capitoline and the
palatine, that so many buildings stood on the site.  judging only from
what is left of the temple of concord, along the ‘forum romanum’, of
which the fall seems quite recent, like that of some huge mountain split
into horrible crags, it does not look as if more than two such edifices
could have found room on the capitoline, on which there were at one
period from five-and-twenty to thirty temples, besides private dwellings.
but, in point of [[fact]], there is scarcely any probability of the views
which we take of the [[city]] being [[correct]], its plan and form having changed
infinitely; for instance, the ‘velabrum’, which on account of its
depressed level, received the sewage of the [[city]], and had a lake, has
been raised by artificial accumulation to a height with the other hills,
and mount savello has, in [[truth]], grown simply out of the ruins of the
theatre of marcellus.  he believed that an ancient roman would not
recognise the place again.  it often happened that in digging down into
earth the workmen came upon the [[crown]] of some lofty column, which, though
thus buried, was still standing upright.  the [[people]] there have no
recourse to other foundations than the vaults and arches of the old
houses, upon which, as on slabs of rock, they raise their [[modern]] palaces.
it is easy to see that several of the ancient streets are thirty feet
below those at [[present]] in use.”

sceptical as montaigne shows himself in his books [[book]], yet during his sojourn
at [[rome]] he manifested a [[great]] regard for [[religion]].  he solicited the
honour of being admitted to kiss the feet of the holy [[father]], gregory
xiii.; and the pontiff exhorted him always to continue in the devotion
which he had hitherto exhibited to the [[church]] and the service of the most
christian [[king]].

“after this, one sees,” says the editor of the journal, “montaigne
employing all his [[time]] in making excursions bout the neighbourhood on
horseback or on foot, in visits, in observations of every [[kind]].  the
churches, the stations, the processions even, the sermons; then the
palaces, the vineyards, the gardens, the [[public]] amusements, as the
carnival, &c.--nothing was overlooked.  he saw a jewish child
circumcised, and wrote down a most minute account of the operation.  he
met at san sisto a muscovite ambassador, the second who had come to rome
since the pontificate of paul iii.  this minister had despatches from his
court for venice, addressed to the ‘grand governor of the signory’.  the
court of muscovy had at that [[time]] such limited relations with the other
powers of [[europe]], and it was so imperfect in its information, that it
thought venice to be a dependency of the holy see.”

of all the particulars with which he has furnished us during his stay at
rome, the following passage in reference to the essays is not the least
singular: “the master of the [[sacred]] palace returned him his essays,
castigated in accordance with the views of the learned monks.  ‘he had
only been able to form a [[judgment]] of them,’ said he, ‘through a certain
french monk, not understanding french himself’”--we leave montaigne
himself to tell the story--“and he received so complacently my excuses
and explanations on each of the passages which had been animadverted upon
by the french monk, that he concluded by leaving me at [[liberty]] to revise
the text agreeably to the dictates of my own [[conscience]].  i begged him,
on the contrary, to abide by the [[opinion]] of the [[person]] who had criticised
me, confessing, among other matters, as, for [[example]], in my use of the
word [[fortune]], in quoting historical poets, in my apology for julian, in
my animadversion on the theory that he who prayed ought to be exempt from
vicious inclinations for the [[time]] being; item, in my estimate of [[cruelty]],
as something beyond simple [[death]]; item, in my view that a child ought to
be brought up to do everything, and so on; that these were my opinions [[opinion]],
which i did not [[think]] [[wrong]]; as to other things, i said that the
corrector understood not my meaning.  the master, who is a clever [[man]],
made many excuses for me, and gave me to suppose that he did not concur
in the suggested improvements; and pleaded very ingeniously for me in my
presence against another (also an italian) who opposed my sentiments.”

such is what passed between montaigne and these two personages at that
time; but when the essayist was leaving, and went to bid them farewell,
they used very different [[language]] to him.  “they prayed me,” says he,
“to [[pay]] no attention to the censure passed on my [[book]], in which other
french persons [[person]] had apprised them that there were many foolish things;
adding, that they honoured my affectionate intention towards the [[church]],
and my capacity; and had so high an [[opinion]] of my candour and
conscientiousness that they should leave it to me to make such
alterations as were proper in the [[book]], when i reprinted it; among other
things, the word [[fortune]].  to excuse themselves for what they had said
against my [[book]], they instanced works [[work]] of our [[time]] by cardinals and other
divines of excellent repute which had been blamed for similar faults [[fault]],
which in no way affected [[reputation]] of the author, or of the publication
as a whole; they requested me to lend the [[church]] the support of my
eloquence (this was their [[fair]] speech), and to make longer stay in the
place, where i should be [[free]] from all further intrusion on their part.
it seemed to me that we parted very [[good]] [[friends]].”

before quitting [[rome]], montaigne received his diploma of citizenship, by
which he was greatly flattered; and after a visit to tivoli he set out
for loretto, stopping at ancona, fano, and urbino.  he arrived at the
beginning of may 1581, at bagno della villa, where he established
himself, order to try the waters.  there, we find in the journal, of his
own accord the essayist lived in the strictest conformity with the
regime, and henceforth we only hear of diet, the effect which the waters
had by degrees [[degree]] upon [[system]], of the manner in which he took them; in a
word, he does not omit an item of the circumstances connected with his
daily routine, his habit of [[body]], his baths, and the rest.  it was no
longer the journal of a traveller which he kept, but the diary of an
invalid,--[“i am reading montaigne’s travels, which have lately been
found; there is little in them but the baths and medicines he took, and
what he had everywhere for dinner.”--h.  walpole to sir horace mann, june
8, 1774.]--attentive to the minutest details of the cure which he was
endeavouring to accomplish: a sort of memorandum [[book]], in which he was
noting down everything that he [[felt]] and did, for the benefit of his
medical [[man]] at [[home]], who would have the [[care]] of his health on his return,
and the attendance on his subsequent infirmities.  montaigne gives it as
his [[reason]] and justification for enlarging to this extent here, that he
had omitted, to his regret, to do so in his visits to other baths, which
might have saved him the trouble of writing at such [[great]] length now; but
it is perhaps a [[better]] [[reason]] in our [[eyes]], that what he wrote he wrote
for his own use.

we find in these accounts, however, many touches which are valuable as
illustrating the manners of the place.  the greater part of the entries
in the journal, giving the account of these waters, and of the travels,
down to montaigne’s arrival at the first french town on his homeward
route, are in italian, because he wished to exercise himself in that
language.

the minute and constant watchfulness of montaigne over his health and
over himself might lead one to suspect that excessive [[fear]] of [[death]] which
degenerates into cowardice.  but was it not rather the [[fear]] of the
operation for the stone, at that [[time]] really formidable?  or perhaps he
was of the same way of thinking with the [[greek]] poet, of whom cicero
reports this saying: “i do not [[desire]] to [[die]]; but the [[thought]] of being
dead is indifferent to me.”  let us hear, however, what he says himself
on this point very frankly: “it would be too [[weak]] and unmanly on my part
if, [[certain]] as i am of always finding myself in the position of having to
succumb in that way,--[to the stone or gravel.]--and [[death]] coming nearer
and nearer to me, i did not make some effort, before the [[time]] came, to
bear the [[trial]] with fortitude.  for [[reason]] prescribes that we should
joyfully accept what it may please [[god]] to send us.  therefore the only
remedy, the only [[rule]], and the sole doctrine for avoiding the evils [[evil]] by
which [[mankind]] is surrounded, whatever they are, is to resolve to bear
them so far as our [[nature]] permits, or to put an end to them courageously
and promptly.”

he was still at the waters of la villa, when, on the 7th september 1581,
he learned by letter that he had been elected mayor of bordeaux on the
1st august preceding.  this [[intelligence]] made him hasten his departure;
and from lucca he proceeded to [[rome]].  he again made some stay in that
city, and he there received the letter of the jurats of bordeaux,
notifying to him officially his election to the mayoralty, and inviting
him to return as speedily as possible.  he left for [[france]], accompanied
by [[young]] d’estissac and several other gentlemen, who escorted him a
considerable distance; but none went back to [[france]] with him, not even
his travelling companion.  he passed by padua, milan, mont cenis, and
chambery; thence he went on to lyons, and lost no [[time]] in repairing to
his chateau, after an absence of seventeen months and eight days.

we have just seen that, during his absence in [[italy]], the author of the
essays was elected mayor of bordeaux.  “the gentlemen of bordeaux,” says
he, “elected me mayor of their town while i was at a distance from
france, and far from the [[thought]] of such a thing.  i excused myself; but
they gave to [[understand]] that i was [[wrong]] in so doing, it being also the
command of the [[king]] that i should stand.”  this the letter which henry
iii. wrote to him on the [[occasion]]:

monsieur, de montaigne,--inasmuch as i hold in [[great]] esteem your fidelity
and zealous devotion to my service, it has been a [[pleasure]] to me to learn
that you have been chosen mayor of my town of bordeaux.  i have had the
agreeable [[duty]] of confirming the selection, and i did so the more
willingly, seeing that it was made during your distant absence; wherefore
it is my [[desire]], and i require and command you expressly that you proceed
without delay to enter on the duties [[duty]] to which you have received so
legitimate a call.  and so you will act in a manner very agreeable to me,
while the contrary will displease me greatly.  praying [[god]], m. de
montaigne, to have you in his holy keeping.

“written at [[paris]], the 25th day of november 1581.

“henri.

“a monsieur de montaigne,
knight of my order, gentleman in ordinary of my
chamber, being at [[present]] in [[rome]].”

montaigne, in his new employment, the most important in the province,
obeyed the axiom, that a [[man]] may not refuse a [[duty]], though it absorb his
time and attention, and even involve the [[sacrifice]] of his [[blood]].  placed
between two extreme parties, ever on the point of getting to blows, he
showed himself in practice what he is in his [[book]], the friend of a middle
and temperate policy.  tolerant by [[character]] and on [[principle]], he
belonged, like all the [[great]] minds [[mind]] of the sixteenth century, to that
political sect which sought to improve, without destroying, [[institutions]];
and we may say of him, what he himself said of la boetie, “that he had
that [[maxim]] indelibly impressed on his [[mind]], to obey and submit himself
religiously to the laws [[law]] under which he was born.  affectionately attached
to the repose of his [[country]], an [[enemy]] to changes [[change]] and innovations, he
would have preferred to employ what means he had towards their
discouragement and suppression, than in promoting their [[success]].”  such
was the platform of his administration.

he applied himself, in an especial manner, to the maintenance of peace
between the two [[religious]] factions which at that [[time]] divided the town of
bordeaux; and at the end of his two first years of office, his grateful
fellow-citizens conferred on him (in 1583) the mayoralty for two years
more, a distinction which had been enjoyed, as he tells us, only twice
before.  on the expiration of his official [[career]], after four years’
duration, he could say fairly enough of himself that he left behind him
neither [[hatred]] nor cause of offence.

in the midst of the cares [[care]] of [[government]], montaigne found [[time]] to revise
and enlarge his essays, which, since their appearance in 1580, were
continually receiving augmentation in the form of additional chapters [[chapter]] or
papers.  two more editions were printed in 1582 and 1587; and during this
time the author, while making alterations in the original text, had
composed part of the third [[book]].  he went to [[paris]] to make arrangements
for the publication of his enlarged labours [[labour]], and a fourth impression in
1588 was the result.  he remained in the [[capital]] some [[time]] on this
occasion, and it was now that he met for the first [[time]] mademoiselle de
gournay.  gifted with an active and inquiring spirit, and, above all,
possessing a sound and healthy tone of [[mind]], mademoiselle de gournay had
been carried from her [[childhood]] with that tide which set in with
sixteenth century towards controversy, learning, and [[knowledge]].  she
learnt latin without a master; and when, the [[age]] of eighteen, she
accidentally became possessor of a copy of the essays, she was
transported with delight and admiration.

she quitted the chateau of gournay, to come and see him.  we cannot do
better, in connection with this [[journey]] of sympathy, than to repeat the
words of pasquier: “that [[young]] [[lady]], allied to several [[great]] and noble
families of [[paris]], proposed to herself no other [[marriage]] than with her
honour, enriched with the [[knowledge]] gained from [[good]] books [[book]], and, beyond
all others, from the essays of m. de montaigne, who making in the year
1588 a lengthened stay in the town of [[paris]], she went there for the
purpose of forming his personal acquaintance; and her [[mother]], madame de
gournay, and herself took him back with them to their chateau, where, at
two or three different times [[time]], he spent three months altogether, most
welcome of visitors.”  it was from this moment that mademoiselle de
gournay dated her adoption as montaigne’s [[daughter]], a circumstance which
has tended to confer immortality upon her in a far greater measure than
her own literary productions.

montaigne, on leaving [[paris]], stayed a short [[time]] at blois, to attend the
meeting of the states-general.  we do not [[know]] what part he took in that
assembly: but it is known that he was commissioned, about this period, to
negotiate between henry of navarre (afterwards henry iv.) and the duke of
guise.  his [[political]] [[life]] is almost a blank; but de thou assures us that
montaigne enjoyed the confidence of the principal persons [[person]] of his [[time]].
de thou, who calls him a frank [[man]] without constraint, tells us that,
walking with him and pasquier in the court at the castle of blois, he
heard him pronounce some very remarkable opinions [[opinion]] on contemporary events,
and he adds that montaigne had foreseen that the troubles in [[france]] could
not end without witnessing the [[death]] of either the [[king]] of navarre or of
the duke of guise.  he had made himself so completely master of the views
of these two princes [[prince]], that he told de thou that the [[king]] of navarre would
have been prepared to embrace catholicism, if he had not been afraid of
being abandoned by his party, and that the duke of guise, on his part,
had no particular repugnance to the [[confession]] of augsburg, for which the
cardinal of lorraine, his uncle, had inspired him with a liking, if it
had not been for the peril involved in quitting the romish communion.  it
would have been easy for montaigne to play, as we call it, a [[great]] part
in [[politics]], and create for himself a lofty position but his motto was,
‘otio et libertati’; and he returned quietly [[home]] to compose a chapter
for his next edition on inconveniences of greatness.

the author of the essays was now fifty-five.  the malady which tormented
him grew only worse and worse with years; and yet he occupied himself
continually with reading, meditating, and composition.  he employed the
years 1589, 1590, and 1591 in making fresh additions to his [[book]]; and
even in the approaches of old [[age]] he might fairly anticipate many happy
hours, when he was attacked by quinsy, depriving him of the power
utterance.  pasquier, who has left us some details  his [[last]] hours,
narrates that he remained three days in full possession of his faculties,
but unable to speak, so that, in order to make known his desires [[desire]], he was
obliged to resort to writing; and as he [[felt]] his end drawing near, he
begged his [[wife]] to summon [[certain]] of the gentlemen who lived in the
neighbourhood to bid them a [[last]] farewell.  when they had arrived, he
caused mass to be celebrated in apartment; and just as the [[priest]] was
elevating the host, montaigne fell forward with his arms extended in
front of him, on the bed, and so expired.  he was in his sixtieth year.
it was the 13th september 1592.

montaigne was buried near his own house; but a few years after his
decease, his remains were removed to the [[church]] of a commandery of st.
antoine at bordeaux, where they still continue.  his monument was
restored in 1803 by a descendant.  it was seen about 1858 by an english
traveller (mr. st.  john).’--[“montaigne the essayist,” by bayle st.
john, 1858, 2 vols.  8vo, is one of most delightful books [[book]] of the [[kind]].]--
and was then in [[good]] preservation.

in 1595 mademoiselle de gournay published a new edition of montaigne’s
essays, and the first with the latest emendations of the author, from a
copy presented to her by his widow, and which has not been recovered,
although it is known to have been in existence some years after the date
of the impression, made on its [[authority]].

coldly as montaigne’s literary productions appear to have been received
by the [[generation]] immediately succeeding his own [[age]], his genius grew
into just appreciation in the seventeenth century, when such great
spirits arose as la bruyere, moliere, la fontaine, madame de sevigne.
“o,” exclaimed the chatelaine des rochers, “what [[capital]] company he is,
the dear man!  he is my old friend; and just for the [[reason]] that he is
so, he always seems new.  my god!  how full is that [[book]] of sense!”
 balzac said that he had carried [[human]] [[reason]] as far and as high as it
could go, both in [[politics]] and in morals [[moral]].  on the other hand, malebranche
and the writers of port [[royal]] were against him; some reprehended the
licentiousness of his writings; others their impiety, materialism,
epicureanism.  even pascal, who had carefully [[read]] the essays, and gained
no small [[profit]] by them, did not spare his reproaches.  but montaigne has
outlived detraction.  as [[time]] has gone on, his admirers and borrowers
have increased in number, and his jansenism, which recommended him to the
eighteenth century, may not be his least recommendation in the
nineteenth.  here we have certainly, on the whole, a first-class [[man]], and
one proof of his masterly genius seems to be, that his merits [[merit]] and his
beauties are sufficient to induce us to leave out of consideration
blemishes and faults [[fault]] which would have been fatal to an inferior writer.





                       the letters of montaigne.


i.

to monsieur de montaigne

[this account of the [[death]] of la boetie begins imperfectly.  it first
appeared in a little volume of miscellanies in 1571.  see hazlitt, ubi
sup.  p.  630.]--as to his [[last]] words, doubtless, if any [[man]] can
give [[good]] account of them, it is i, both because, during the whole of his
sickness he conversed as fully with me as with any one, and also because,
in consequence of the singular and brotherly [[friendship]] which we had
entertained for each other, i was perfectly acquainted with the
intentions, opinions [[opinion]], and wishes [[wish]] which he had formed in the course of his
life, as much so, certainly, as one [[man]] can possibly be with those of
another [[man]]; and because i knew them to be elevated, [[virtuous]], full of
steady resolution, and (after all said) admirable.  i well foresaw that,
if his illness permitted him to express himself, he would allow nothing
to fall from him, in such an extremity, that was not replete with good
example.  i consequently took every [[care]] in my [[power]] to treasure what was
said.  true it is, monseigneur, as my memory is not only in itself very
short, but in this case affected by the trouble which i have undergone,
through so heavy and important a loss, that i have forgotten a number of
things which i should [[wish]] to have had known; but those which i recollect
shall be related to you as exactly as lies [[lie]] in my [[power]].  for to represent
in full measure his [[noble]] [[career]] suddenly arrested, to paint to you his
indomitable [[courage]], in a [[body]] worn out and prostrated by [[pain]] and the
assaults of [[death]], i confess, would demand a far [[better]] ability than
mine: because, although, when in former years he discoursed on serious
and important matters, he handled them in such a manner that it was
difficult to reproduce exactly what he said, yet his ideas [[idea]] and his words
at the [[last]] seemed to rival each other in serving him.  for i am sure
that i never knew him give birth to such fine conceptions, or display so
much eloquence, as in the [[time]] of his sickness.  if, monseigneur, you
blame me for introducing his more ordinary observations, please to know
that i do so advisedly; for since they proceeded from him at a season of
such [[great]] trouble, they indicate the [[perfect]] tranquillity of his mind
and thoughts [[thought]] to the [[last]].

on monday, the 9th day of august 1563, on my return from the court, i
sent an invitation to him to come and dine with me.  he returned word
that he was obliged, but, being indisposed, he would thank me to do him
the [[pleasure]] of spending an hour with him before he started for medoc.
shortly after my dinner i went to him.  he had laid himself down on the
bed with his clothes on, and he was already, i perceived, much changed.
he complained of diarrhoea, accompanied by the gripes, and said that he
had it about him ever since he played with m. d’escars with nothing but
his doublet on, and that with him a cold often brought on such attacks.
i advised him to go as he had proposed, but to stay for the night at
germignac, which is only about two leagues from the town.  i gave him
this [[advice]], because some houses, near to that where he was ping, were
visited by the plague, about which he was nervous since his return from
perigord and the agenois, here it had been raging; and, besides, horse
exercise was, from my own [[experience]], beneficial under similar
circumstances.  he set out, accordingly, with his [[wife]] and m.
bouillhonnas, his uncle.

early on the following morning, however, i had [[intelligence]] from madame
de la boetie, that in the night he had fresh and [[violent]] attack of
dysentery.  she had called in physician and apothecary, and prayed me to
lose no [[time]] coming, which (after dinner) i did.  he was delighted to see
me; and when i was going away, under promise to turn the following day,
he begged me more importunately and affectionately than he was wont to
do, to give him as such of my company as possible.  i was a little
affected; yet was about to leave, when madame de la boetie, as if she
foresaw something about to happen, implored me with tears to stay the
night.  when i consented, he seemed to grow more cheerful.  i returned
home the next day, and on the thursday i paid him another visit.  he had
become worse; and his loss of [[blood]] from the dysentery, which reduced his
strength very much, was largely on the increase.  i quitted his side on
friday, but on saturday i went to him, and found him very [[weak]].  he then
gave me to [[understand]] that his complaint was infectious, and, moreover,
disagreeable and depressing; and that he, knowing thoroughly my
constitution, [[desired]] that i should content myself with coming to see him
now and then.  on the contrary, after that i never left his side.

it was only on the sunday that he began to converse with me on any
subject beyond the immediate one of his illness, and what the ancient
doctors [[thought]] of it: we had not touched on [[public]] affairs, for i found
at the very outset that he had a dislike to them.

but, on the sunday, he had a fainting fit; and when he came to himself,
he told me that everything seemed to him confused, as if in a mist and in
disorder, and that, nevertheless, this visitation was not unpleasing to
him.  “death,” i replied, “has no worse sensation, my [[brother]].”  “none so
bad,” was his [[answer]].  he had had no regular sleep since the beginning of
his illness; and as he became worse and worse, he began to turn his
attention to questions [[question]] which [[men]] commonly occupy themselves with in the
last extremity, despairing now of getting [[better]], and intimating as much
to me.  on that day, as he appeared in tolerably [[good]] spirits, i took
occasion to say to him that, in consideration of the singular [[love]] i bore
him, it would become me to take [[care]] that his affairs, which he had
conducted with such rare prudence in his [[life]], should not be neglected at
present; and that i should regret it if, from want of proper counsel, he
should leave anything unsettled, not only on account of the loss to his
family, but also to his [[good]] name.

he thanked me for my [[kindness]]; and after a little reflection, as if he
was resolving [[certain]] doubts [[doubt]] in his own [[mind]], he [[desired]] me to summon his
uncle and his [[wife]] by themselves, in order that he might acquaint them
with his testamentary dispositions.  i told him that this would shock
them.  “no, no,” he answered, “i will cheer them by making out my case to
be [[better]] than it is.”  and then he inquired, whether we were not all
much taken by surprise at his having fainted?  i replied, that it was of
no importance, being incidental to the complaint from which he [[suffered]].
“true, my [[brother]],” said he; “it would be unimportant, even though it
should lead to what you most dread.”  “for you,” i rejoined, “it might be
a [[happy]] thing; but i should be the loser, who would thereby be deprived
of so [[great]], so [[wise]], and so steadfast a friend, a friend whose place i
should never see supplied.”  “it is very likely you may not,” was his
answer; “and be sure that one thing which makes me somewhat anxious to
recover, and to delay my [[journey]] to that place, whither i am already
half-way gone, is the [[thought]] of the loss both you and that [[poor]] [[man]] and
woman there (referring to his uncle and wife) must sustain; for i love
them with my whole [[heart]], and i [[feel]] [[certain]] that they will find it very
hard to lose me.  i should also regret it on account of such as have, in
my lifetime, valued me, and whose conversation i should like to have
enjoyed a little longer; and i beseech you, my [[brother]], if i leave the
world, to carry to them for me an assurance of the esteem i entertained
for them to the [[last]] moment of my existence.  my birth was, moreover,
scarcely to so little [[purpose]] but that, had i lived, i might have done
some service to the [[public]]; but, however this may be, i am prepared to
submit to the will of [[god]], when it shall please him to call me, being
confident of enjoying the tranquillity which you have foretold for me.
as for you, my friend, i [[feel]] sure that you are so [[wise]], that you will
control your emotions, and submit to his [[divine]] ordinance regarding me;
and i beg of you to see that that [[good]] [[man]] and woman do not mourn for my
departure unnecessarily.”

he proceeded to inquire how they behaved at [[present]].  “very well,” said
i, “considering the circumstances.”  “ah!”  he replied, “that is, so long
as they do not abandon all [[hope]] of me; but when that shall be the case,
you will have a hard task to support them.”  it was owing to his strong
regard for his [[wife]] and uncle that he studiously disguised from them his
own conviction as to the certainty of his end, and he prayed me to do the
same.  when they were near him he assumed an appearance of gaiety, and
flattered them with hopes [[hope]].  i then went to call them.  they came, wearing
as composed an air as possible; and when we four were together, he
addressed us, with an untroubled countenance, as follows: “uncle and
wife, rest assured that no new attack of my disease, or fresh [[doubt]] that
i have as to my recovery, has [[led]] me to take this step of communicating
to you my intentions, for, thank [[god]], i [[feel]] very well and hopeful; but
taught by observation and [[experience]] the instability of all [[human]] things,
and even of the [[life]] to which we are so much attached, and which is,
nevertheless, a mere bubble; and knowing, moreover, that my [[state]] of
health brings me more within the danger of [[death]], i have [[thought]] proper
to settle my worldly affairs, having the benefit of your [[advice]].”  then
addressing himself more particularly to his uncle, “good uncle,” said he,
“if i were to rehearse all the obligations under which i [[lie]] to you, i am
sure that i never should make an end.  let me only say that, wherever i
have been, and with whomsoever i have conversed, i have represented you
as doing for me all that a [[father]] could do for a [[son]]; both in the care
with which you tended my [[education]], and in the zeal with which you pushed
me forward into [[public]] [[life]], so that my whole existence is a testimony of
your [[good]] offices towards me.  in short, i am indebted for all that i
have to you, who have been to me as a parent; and therefore i have no
right to part with anything, unless it be with your approval.”

there was a general [[silence]] hereupon, and his uncle was prevented from
replying by tears and sobs.  at [[last]] he said that whatever he [[thought]] for
the [[best]] would be agreeable to him; and as he intended to make him his
heir, he was at [[liberty]] to dispose of what would be his.

then he turned to his [[wife]].  “my image,” said he (for so he often called
her, there being some sort of relationship between them), “since i have
been [[united]] to you by [[marriage]], which is one of the most weighty and
sacred ties imposed on us by [[god]], for the [[purpose]] of maintaining human
society, i have continued to [[love]], cherish, and value you; and i know
that you have returned my affection, for which i have no sufficient
acknowledgment.  i beg you to accept such portion of my estate as i
bequeath to you, and be satisfied with it, though it is very inadequate
to your desert.”

afterwards he turned to me.  “my [[brother]],” he began, “for whom i have so
entire a [[love]], and whom i selected out of so large a number, thinking to
revive with you that [[virtuous]] and sincere [[friendship]] which, owing to the
degeneracy of the [[age]], has grown to be almost unknown to us, and now
exists only in [[certain]] vestiges of antiquity, i beg of you, as a mark of
my affection to you, to accept my library: a slender offering, but given
with a cordial will, and suitable to you, seeing that you are fond of
learning.  it will be a memorial of your old companion.”

then he addressed all three of us.  he blessed [[god]] that in his extremity
he had the [[happiness]] to be surrounded by those whom he held dearest in
the [[world]], and he looked upon it as a fine spectacle, where four persons
were together, so unanimous in their feelings, and loving each other for
each other’s sake.  he commended us one to the other; and proceeded thus:
“my worldly matters being arranged, i must now [[think]] of the welfare of my
soul.  i am a [[christian]]; i am a catholic.  i have lived one, and i shall
die one.  send for a [[priest]]; for i [[wish]] to conform to this [[last]] christian
obligation.”  he now concluded his discourse, which he had conducted with
such a firm face and with so distinct an utterance, that whereas, when i
first entered his room, he was feeble, inarticulate in his [[speech]], his
pulse low and feverish, and his features pallid, now, by a sort of
miracle, he appeared to have rallied, and his pulse was so [[strong]] that
for the sake of comparison, i [[asked]] him to [[feel]] mine.

i [[felt]] my [[heart]] so [[oppressed]] at this moment, that i had not the [[power]] to
make him any [[answer]]; but in the course of two or three hours, solicitous
to keep up his [[courage]], and, likewise, out of the tenderness which i had
had all my [[life]] for his [[honour]] and fame, wishing a larger number of
witnesses to his admirable fortitude, i said to him, how much i was
ashamed to [[think]] that i lacked [[courage]] to listen to what he, so [[great]] a
sufferer, had the [[courage]] to deliver; that down to the [[present]] [[time]] i had
scarcely conceived that [[god]] granted us such command over human
infirmities, and had found a difficulty in crediting the examples [[example]] i had
read in histories [[history]]; but that with such evidence of the thing before my
eyes, i gave [[praise]] to [[god]] that it had shown itself in one so excessively
dear to me, and who loved me so entirely, and that his [[example]] would help
me to act in a similar manner when my turn came.  interrupting me, he
begged that it might happen so, and that the conversation which had
passed between us might not be mere words, but might be impressed deeply
on our minds [[mind]], to be put in exercise at the first [[occasion]]; and that this
was the real object and aim of all [[philosophy]].

he then took my hand, and continued: “brother, friend, there are many
acts of my [[life]], i [[think]], which have cost me as much difficulty as this
one is likely to do; and, after all, i have been long prepared for it,
and have my lesson by [[heart]].  have i not lived long enough?  i am just
upon thirty-three.  by the grace of [[god]], my days so far have known
nothing but health and [[happiness]]; but in the ordinary course of our
unstable [[human]] affairs, this could not have lasted much longer; it would
have become [[time]] for me to enter on graver avocations, and i should thus
have involved myself in numberless vexations, and, among them, the
troubles of old [[age]], from which i shall now be exempt.  moreover, it is
probable that hitherto my [[life]] has been spent more simply, and with less
of [[evil]], than if [[god]] had spared me, and i had survived to [[feel]] the
thirst for riches [[rich]] and worldly [[prosperity]].  i am sure, for my part, that
i now go to [[god]] and the place of the blessed.”  he seemed to detect in
my expression some inquietude at his words; and he exclaimed, “what, my
brother, would you make me entertain apprehensions?  had i any, whom
would it become so much as yourself to remove them?”

the notary, who had been summoned to draw up his will, came in the
evening, and when he had the documents prepared, i inquired of la boetie
if he would sign them.  “sign them,” cried he; “i will do so with my own
hand; but i could [[desire]] more [[time]], for i [[feel]] exceedingly timid and
weak, and in a manner exhausted.”  but when i was going to [[change]] the
conversation, he suddenly rallied, said he had but a short [[time]] to [[live]],
and [[asked]] if the notary wrote rapidly, for he should dictate without
making any pause.  the notary was called, and he dictated his will there
and then with such speed that the [[man]] could scarcely keep up with him;
and when he had done, he [[asked]] me to [[read]] it out, saying to me, “what a
good thing it is to look after what are called our riches [[rich]].”  ‘sunt haec,
quoe hominibus vocantur bona’.  as soon as the will was signed, the
chamber being full, he [[asked]] me if it would hurt him to talk.  i
answered, that it would not, if he did not speak too loud.  he then
summoned mademoiselle de saint quentin, his niece, to him, and addressed
her thus: “dear niece, since my earliest acquaintance with thee, i have
observed the marks of, [[great]] [[natural]] goodness in thee; but the services
which thou rendered to me, with so much affectionate diligence, in my
present and [[last]] necessity, inspire me with high hopes [[hope]] of thee; and i am
under [[great]] obligations to thee, and give thee most affectionate thanks.
let me relieve my [[conscience]] by counselling thee to be, in the first
place, devout, to [[god]]: for this doubtless is our first [[duty]], failing
which all others can be of little advantage or grace, but which, duly
observed, carries with it necessarily all other virtues [[virtue]].  after [[god]], thou
shouldest [[love]] thy [[father]] and mother--thy [[mother]], my sister, whom i
regard as one of the [[best]] and most [[intelligent]] of [[women]], and by whom i
beg of thee to let thy own [[life]] be regulated.  allow not thyself to be
led away by pleasures [[pleasure]]; shun, like the plague, the foolish familiarities
thou seest between some [[men]] and [[women]]; harmless enough at first, but
which by insidious degrees [[degree]] [[corrupt]] the [[heart]], and thence lead it to
negligence, and then into the vile slough of [[vice]].  credit me, the
greatest safeguard to female chastity is sobriety of demeanour.  i
beseech and direct that thou often call to [[mind]] the [[friendship]] which was
betwixt us; but i do not [[wish]] thee to mourn for me too much--an
injunction which, so far as it is in my [[power]], i lay on all my [[friends]],
since it might seem that by doing so they [[felt]] a [[jealousy]] of that blessed
condition in which i am about to be placed by [[death]].  i assure thee, my
dear, that if i had the option now of continuing in [[life]] or of completing
the [[voyage]] on which i have set out, i should find it very hard to choose.
adieu, dear niece.”

mademoiselle d’arsat, his stepdaughter, was next called.  he said to her:
“daughter, you stand in no [[great]] need of [[advice]] from me, insomuch as you
have a [[mother]], whom i have ever found most sagacious, and entirely in
conformity with my own opinions [[opinion]] and wishes [[wish]], and whom i have never found
faulty; with such a preceptress, you cannot fail to be properly
instructed.  do not account it singular that i, with no tie of [[blood]] to
you, am interested in you; for, being the child of one who is so closely
allied to me, i am necessarily concerned in what concerns you; and
consequently the affairs of your [[brother]], m. d’arsat, have ever been
watched by me with as much [[care]] as my own; nor perhaps will it be to your
disadvantage that you were my step-daughter.  you enjoy sufficient store
of [[wealth]] and [[beauty]]; you are a [[lady]] of [[good]] [[family]]; it only remains for
you to add to these possessions the cultivation of your [[mind]], in which i
exhort you not to fail.  i do not [[think]] necessary to warn you against
vice, a thing so odious in [[women]], for i would not even suppose that you
could harbour any inclination for it--nay, i [[believe]] that you hold the
very name in abhorrence.  dear [[daughter]], farewell.”

all in the room were weeping and lamenting; but he held without
interruption the thread of his discourse, which was pretty long.  but
when he had done, he directed us all to leave the room, except the women
attendants, whom he styled his garrison.  but first, calling to him my
brother, m. de beauregard, he said to him: “m. de beauregard, you have
my [[best]] thanks for all the [[care]] you have taken of me.  i have now a thing
which i am very anxious indeed to mention to you, and with your
permission i will do so.”  as my [[brother]] gave him encouragement to
proceed, he added: “i assure you that i never knew any [[man]] who engaged in
the reformation of our [[church]] with greater sincerity, earnestness, and
single-heartedness than yourself.  i consider that you were [[led]] to it by
observing the vicious [[character]] of our prelates, which no [[doubt]] much
requires setting in order, and by imperfections which [[time]] has brought
into our [[church]].  it is not my [[desire]] at [[present]]  discourage you from
this course, for i would have no one act in opposition to his [[conscience]];
but i [[wish]], having regard to the [[good]] repute acquired by your [[family]] from
its enduring concord--a [[family]] than which none can be dearer to me; a
family, thank god!  no member of which has ever been guilty of dishonour
--in regard, further, to the will of your [[good]] [[father]] to whom you owe so
much, and of your, uncle, i [[wish]] you to avoid extreme means; avoid
harshness and [[violence]]: be reconciled with your relatives; do not act
apart, but unite.  you perceive what disasters our quarrels have brought
upon this [[kingdom]], and i anticipate still worse mischiefs; and in your
goodness and [[wisdom]], beware of involving your [[family]] in such broils; let
it continue to enjoy its former [[reputation]] and [[happiness]].  m. de
beauregard, take what i say in [[good]] part, and as a proof of the
friendship i [[feel]] for you.  i postponed till now any communication with
you on the [[subject]], and perhaps the condition in which you see me address
you, may cause my [[advice]] and [[opinion]] to carry greater [[authority]].”  my
brother expressed his thanks to him cordially.

on the monday morning he had become so ill that he quite despaired of
himself; and he said to me very pitifully: “brother, do not you [[feel]] pain
for all the [[pain]] i am suffering?  do you not perceive now that the help
you give me has no other effect than that of lengthening my suffering?”

shortly afterwards he fainted, and we all [[thought]] him gone; but by the
application of vinegar and wine he rallied.  but he soon sank, and when
he heard us in lamentation, he murmured, “o god!  who is it that teases
me so?  why did you break the agreeable repose i was enjoying?  i beg of
you to leave me.”  and then, when he caught the sound of my voice, he
continued: “and art [[arts]] thou, my [[brother]], likewise unwilling to see me at
peace?  o, how thou robbest me of my repose!”  after a while, he seemed
to gain more [[strength]], and called for wine, which he relished, and
declared it to be the finest drink possible.  i, in order to [[change]] the
current of his thoughts [[thought]], put in, “surely not; water is the [[best]].”  “ah,
yes,” he returned, “doubtless so;--(greek phrase)--.”  he had now become,
icy-cold at his extremities, even to his face; a deathly perspiration was
upon him, and his pulse was scarcely perceptible.

this morning he confessed, but the [[priest]] had omitted to bring with him
the necessary apparatus for celebrating mass.  on the tuesday, however,
m. de la boetie summoned him to aid him, as he said, in discharging the
last office of a [[christian]].   after the conclusion of mass, he took the
sacrament; when the [[priest]] was about to depart, he said to him:
“spiritual [[father]], i implore you humbly, as well as those over whom you
are set, to [[pray]] to the almighty on my behalf; that, if it be decreed in
heaven that i am now to end my [[life]], he will take compassion on my [[soul]],
and pardon me my sins [[sin]], which are manifold, it not being possible for so
weak and [[poor]] a creature as i to obey completely the will of such a
master; or, if he [[think]] fit to keep me longer here, that it may please
him to release my [[present]] extreme anguish, and to direct my footsteps in
the [[right]] path, that i may become a [[better]] [[man]] than i have been.”  he
paused to recover breath a little; [[priest]] was about to go away, he called
him back and proceeded: “i [[desire]] to say, besides, in your hearing this:
i declare that i was christened and i have lived, and that so i [[wish]] to
die, in the [[faith]] which [[moses]] preached in [[egypt]]; which afterwards the
patriarchs accepted and professed in judaea; and which, in the course of
time, has been transmitted to [[france]] and to us.”  he seemed desirous of
adding something more, but he ended with a request to his uncle and me to
send up prayers for him; “for those are,” he said, “the [[best]] duties [[duty]] that
christians can fulfil one for another.”  in the course of talking, his
shoulder was uncovered, and although a man-servant stood near him, he
asked his uncle to re-adjust the clothes.  then, turning his [[eyes]] towards
me, he said, “ingenui est, cui multum debeas, ei plurimum velle debere.”

m. de belot called in the afternoon to see him, and m. de la boetie,
taking his hand, said to him: “i was on the point of discharging my debt,
but my [[kind]] creditor has given me a little further [[time]].”  a little while
after, appearing to wake out of a sort of reverie, he uttered words which
he had employed once or twice before in the course of his sickness:
“ah well, ah well, whenever the hour comes, i await it with [[pleasure]] and
fortitude.”  and then, as they were holding his mouth open by [[force]] to
give him a draught, he observed to m. de belot: “an vivere tanti est?”

as the evening approached, he began perceptibly to sink; and while i
supped, he sent for me to come, being no more than the shadow of a [[man]],
or, as he put it himself, ‘non homo, sed [[species]] hominis’; and he said to
me with the utmost difficulty: “my [[brother]], my friend, please [[god]] i may
realise the imaginations [[imagination]] i have just enjoyed.”  afterwards, having waited
for some [[time]] while he remained silent, and by painful efforts was
drawing long sighs (for his tongue at this point began to refuse its
functions), i said, “what are they?”  “grand, grand!”  he replied.  “i
have never yet failed,” returned i, “to have the [[honour]] of hearing your
conceptions and imaginations [[imagination]] communicated to me; will you not now still
let me enjoy them?”  “i would indeed,” he answered; “but, my [[brother]],
i am not able to do so; they are admirable, infinite, and unspeakable.”
 we stopped short there, for he could not go on.  a little before, indeed,
he had shown a [[desire]] to speak to his [[wife]], and had told her, with as gay
a countenance as he could contrive to assume, that he had a story to tell
her.  and it seemed as if he was making an attempt to gain utterance;
but, his [[strength]] failing him, he begged a little wine to resuscitate it.
it was of no avail, for he fainted away suddenly, and was for some time
insensible.  having become so near a neighbour to [[death]], and hearing the
sobs of mademoiselle de la boetie, he called her, and said to her thus:
“my own likeness, you grieve yourself beforehand; will you not have pity
on me?  take [[courage]].  assuredly, it costs me more than half the [[pain]] i
endure, to see you suffer; and reasonably so, because the evils [[evil]] which we
ourselves [[feel]] we do not actually ourselves suffer, but it certain
sentient faculties which [[god]] plants in us, that [[feel]] them: whereas what
we [[feel]] on account of others, we [[feel]] by consequence of a certain
reasoning process which goes on within our minds [[mind]].  but i am going away”
 --that he said because his [[strength]] was failing him; and fearing that he
had frightened his [[wife]], he resumed, observing: “i am going to sleep.
good night, my [[wife]]; go thy way.”  this was the [[last]] farewell he took of
her.

after she had left, “my [[brother]],” said he to me, “keep near me, if you
please;” and then feeling the advance of [[death]] more pressing and more
acute, or else the effect of some warm draught which they had made him
swallow, his voice grew stronger and clearer, and he turned quite with
violence in his bed, so that all began again to entertain the [[hope]] which
we had lost only upon witnessing his extreme prostration.

at this stage he proceeded, among other things, to [[pray]] me again and
again, in a most affectionate manner, to give him a place; so that i was
apprehensive that his [[reason]] might be impaired, particularly when, on my
pointing out to him that he was doing himself harm, and that these were
not of the words of a [[rational]] [[man]], he did not yield at first, but
redoubled his outcry, saying, “my [[brother]], my brother!  dost thou then
refuse me a place?”  insomuch that he constrained me to demonstrate to
him that, as he breathed and spoke, and had his physical being, therefore
he had his place.  “yes, yes,” he responded, “i have; but it is not that
which i need; and, besides, when all is said, i have no longer any
existence.”  “god,” i replied, “will grant you a [[better]] one soon.”
 “would it were now, my [[brother]],” was his [[answer]].  “it is now three days
since i have been eager to take my departure.”

being in this extremity, he frequently called me, merely to satisfy him
that i was at his side.  at length, he composed himself a little to rest,
which strengthened our hopes [[hope]]; so much so, indeed, that i left the room,
and went to rejoice thereupon with mademoiselle de la boetie.  but, an
hour or so afterwards, he called me by name once or twice, and then with
a long sigh expired at three o’clock on wednesday morning, the 18th
august 1563, having lived thirty-two years, nine months, and seventeen
days.




ii.

to monseigneur, monseigneur de montaigne.

[this letter is prefixed to montaigne’s translation of the “natural
theology” of raymond de sebonde, printed at [[paris]] in 1569.]

in pursuance of the instructions which you gave me [[last]] year in your
house at montaigne, monseigneur, i have put into a french dress, with my
own hand, raymond de sebonde, that [[great]] spanish theologian and
philosopher; and i have divested him, so far as i could, of that rough
bearing and barbaric appearance which you saw him wear at first; that, in
my [[opinion]], he is now qualified to [[present]] himself in the [[best]] company.
it is perfectly possible that some fastidious persons [[person]] will detect in the
book some trace of gascon parentage; but it will be so much the more to
their discredit, that they allowed the task to devolve on one who is
quite a novice in these things.  it is only [[right]], monseigneur, that the
work should come before the [[world]] under your auspices, since whatever
emendations and polish it may have received, are owing to you.  still i
see well that, if you [[think]] proper to balance accounts with the author,
you will find yourself much his debtor; for against his excellent and
religious discourses, his lofty and, so to speak, [[divine]] conceptions, you
will find that you will have to set nothing but words and phraseology; a
sort of merchandise so ordinary and commonplace, that whoever has the
most of it, peradventure is the worst off.

monseigneur, i [[pray]] [[god]] to grant you a very long and [[happy]] [[life]].  from
paris, this 18th of june 1568.  your most humble and most [[obedient]] [[son]],

michel de montaigne




iii.

to monsieur, monsieur de lansac,--[this letter appears to belong to
1570.]--knight of the king’s order, privy councillor, sub-controller of
his finance, and captain of the cent gardes of his household.

monsieur,--i send you the oeconomics of xenophon, put into french by the
late m. de la boetie,--[printed at [[paris]], 8vo, 1571, and reissued, with
the addition of some notes, in 1572, with a fresh title-page.]--a present
which appears to me to be appropriate, as well because it is the [[work]] of
a gentleman of mark,--[meaning xenophon.]--a [[man]] illustrious in [[war]] and
peace, as because it has taken its second shape from a personage whom i
know to have been held by you in affectionate regard during his [[life]].
this will be an inducement to you to continue to cherish towards his
memory, your [[good]] [[opinion]] and goodwill.  and to be bold with you,
monsieur, do not [[fear]] to increase these sentiments somewhat; for, as you
had [[knowledge]] of his high qualities only in his [[public]] capacity, it rests
with me to assure you how many endowments he possessed beyond your
personal [[experience]] of him.  he did me the [[honour]], while he lived, and i
count it amongst the most fortunate circumstances in my own [[career]], to
have with me a [[friendship]] so close and so intricately knit, that no
movement, impulse, [[thought]], of his [[mind]] was kept from me, and if i have
not formed a [[right]] [[judgment]] of him, i must suppose it to be from my own
want of scope.  indeed, without exaggeration, he was so nearly a prodigy,
that i am afraid of not being credited when i speak of him, even though i
should keep much within the mark of my own actual [[knowledge]].  and for
this [[time]], monsieur, i shall content myself with praying you, for the
honour and [[respect]] we owe to [[truth]], to testify and [[believe]] that our
guienne never beheld his peer among the [[men]] of his vocation.  under the
hope, therefore, that you will [[pay]] him his just due, and in order to
refresh him in your memory, i [[present]] you this [[book]], which will answer
for me that, were it not for the insufficiency of my [[power]], i would offer
you as willingly something of my own, as an acknowledgment of the
obligations i owe to you, and of the ancient favour and [[friendship]] which
you have borne towards the members of our house.  but, monsieur, in
default of [[better]] coin, i offer you in payment the assurance of my desire
to do you humble service.

monsieur, i [[pray]] [[god]] to have you in his keeping.  your [[obedient]] servant,
michel de montaigne.




iv.

to monsieur, monsieur de mesmes, [[lord]] of roissy and malassize, privy
councillor to the [[king]].

monsieur,--it is one of the most conspicuous follies committed by [[men]],
to employ the [[strength]] of their understanding in overturning and
destroying those opinions [[opinion]] which are commonly received among us, and which
afford us satisfaction and content; for while everything beneath heaven
employs the ways and means placed at its disposal by [[nature]] for the
advancement and commodity of its being, these, in order to appear of a
more sprightly and enlightened wit, not accepting anything which has not
been tried and balanced a thousand times [[time]] with the most subtle reasoning,
sacrifice their [[peace]] of [[mind]] to [[doubt]], uneasiness, and feverish
excitement.  it is not without [[reason]] that [[childhood]] and simplicity have
been recommended by holy writ itself.  for my part, i prefer to be quiet
rather than clever: give me content, even if i am not to be so wide in my
range.  this is the [[reason]], monsieur, why, although persons [[person]] of an
ingenious turn laugh at our [[care]] as to what will happen after our own
time, for instance, to our souls [[soul]], which, lodged elsewhere, will lose all
consciousness of what goes on here below, yet i consider it to be a great
consolation for the frailty and brevity of [[life]], to reflect that we have
the [[power]] of prolonging it by [[reputation]] and fame; and i embrace very
readily this pleasant and favourable notion original with our being,
without inquiring too critically how or why it is.  insomuch that having
loved, beyond everything, the late m. de la boetie, the [[greatest]] [[man]], in
my [[judgment]], of our [[age]], i should [[think]] myself very negligent of my duty
if i failed, to the utmost of my [[power]], to prevent such a name as his,
and a memory so richly meriting remembrance, from falling into oblivion;
and if i did not use my [[best]] endeavour to keep them fresh.  i believe
that he feels [[feel]] something of what i do on his behalf, and that my services
touch and rejoice him.  in [[fact]], he lives [[life]] in my [[heart]] so vividly and so
wholly, that i am loath to [[believe]] him committed to the dull ground, or
altogether cast off from communication with us.  therefore, monsieur,
since every new [[light]] i can shed on him and his name, is so much added to
his second period of existence, and, moreover, since his name is ennobled
and honoured by the place which receives it, it falls to me not only to
extend it as widely as i can, but to confide it to the keeping of persons
of [[honour]] and [[virtue]]; among whom you hold such a rank, that, to afford
you the opportunity of receiving this new guest, and giving him good
entertainment, i decided on presenting to you this little [[work]], not for
any [[profit]] you are likely to derive from it, being well aware that you do
not need to have plutarch and his companions interpreted to you--but it
is possible that madame de roissy, reading in it the order of her
household management and of your [[happy]] accord painted to the [[life]], will
be pleased to see how her own [[natural]] inclination has not only reached
but surpassed the theories of the wisest [[philosophers]], regarding the
duties and laws [[law]] of the wedded [[state]].  and, at all events, it will be
always an [[honour]] to me, to be able to do anything which shall be for the
pleasure of you and yours, on account of the obligation under which i lie
to serve you.

monsieur, i [[pray]] [[god]] to grant you a long and [[happy]] [[life]].  from montaigne,
this 30th april 1570.  your humble servant,
michel de montaigne.




v.

to monsieur, monsieur de l’hospital, chancellor of france

monseigneur,--i am of the [[opinion]] that persons [[person]] such as you, to whom
fortune and [[reason]] have committed the charge of [[public]] affairs, are not
more inquisitive in any point than in ascertaining the [[character]] of those
in office under you; for no [[society]] is so poorly furnished, but that, if
a proper distribution of [[authority]] be used, it has persons [[person]] sufficient for
the discharge of all official duties [[duty]]; and when this is the case, nothing
is wanting to make a [[state]] [[perfect]] in its [[constitution]].  now, in
proportion as this is so much to be [[desired]], so it is the more difficult
of accomplishment, since you cannot have [[eyes]] to embrace a multitude so
large and so widely extended, nor to see to the bottom of hearts [[heart]], in
order that you may discover intentions and consciences, matters
principally to be considered; so that there has never been any
commonwealth so well organised, in which we might not detect often enough
defect in such a department or such a [[choice]]; and in those systems [[system]], where
ignorance and malice, favouritism, intrigue, and [[violence]] govern, if any
selection happens to be made on the ground of [[merit]] and regularity, we
may doubtless thank [[fortune]], which, in its capricious movements, has for
once taken the path of [[reason]].

this consideration, monseigneur, often consoled me, when i beheld m.
etienne de la boetie, one of the fittest [[men]] for high office in [[france]],
pass his whole [[life]] without employment and notice, by his domestic
hearth, to the singular detriment of the [[public]]; for, so far as he was
concerned, i may assure you, monseigneur, that he was so [[rich]] in those
treasures which defy [[fortune]], that never was [[man]] more satisfied or
content.  i [[know]], indeed, that he was raised to the dignities connected
with his neighbourhood--dignities accounted considerable; and i know
also, that no one ever acquitted himself [[better]] of them; and when he died
at the [[age]] of thirty-two, he enjoyed a [[reputation]] in that way beyond all
who had preceded him.

but for all that, it is no [[reason]] that a [[man]] should be left a common
soldier, who deserves to become a captain; nor to assign mean functions
to those who are perfectly [[equal]] to the highest.  in [[truth]], his powers
were badly economised and too sparingly employed; insomuch that, over and
above his actual [[work]], there was abundant capacity lying idle which might
have been called into service, both to the [[public]] advantage and his own
private [[glory]].

therefore, monseigneur, since he was so indifferent to his own fame (for
virtue and [[ambition]], unfortunately, seldom lodge together), and since he
lived in an [[age]] when others were too dull or too [[jealous]] to witness to
his [[character]], i have it marvellously at [[heart]] that his memory, at all
events, to which i owe the [[good]] offices of a friend, should enjoy the
recompense of his brave [[life]]; and that it should survive in the good
report of [[men]] of [[honour]] and [[virtue]].  on this account, sir, i have been
desirous to bring to [[light]], and [[present]] to you, such few latin verses as
he left behind.  different from the builder, who places the most
attractive, portion of his house towards the street, and to the draper,
who displays in his window his [[best]] goods [[good]], that which was most precious
in my friend, the juice and marrow of his genius, departed with him, and
there have remained to us but the bark and the leaves.

the exactly regulated movements of his [[mind]], his piety, his [[virtue]], his
justice, his vivacity, the solidity and soundness of his [[judgment]], the
loftiness of his ideas [[idea]], raised so far above the [[common]] level, his
learning, the grace which accompanied his most ordinary actions, the
tender affection he had for his miserable [[country]], and his supreme and
sworn detestation of all [[vice]], but principally of that villainous traffic
which disguises itself under the honourable name of [[justice]], should
certainly impress all well-disposed persons [[person]] with a singular [[love]] towards
him, and an extraordinary regret for his loss.  but, sir, i am unable to
do [[justice]] to all these qualities; and of the fruit of his own studies it
had not entered into his [[mind]] to leave any proof to [[posterity]]; all that
remains, is the little which, as a pastime, he did at intervals.

however this may be, i beg you, sir, to receive it kindly; and as our
judgment of [[great]] things is many times [[time]] formed from lesser things, and as
even the recreations of illustrious [[men]] carry with them, to intelligent
observers, some honourable traits of their origin, i would have you form
from this, some [[knowledge]] of him, and hence lovingly cherish his name and
his memory.  in this, sir, you will only reciprocate the high opinion
which he had of your [[virtue]], and realise what he infinitely [[desired]] in
his lifetime; for there was no one in the [[world]] in whose acquaintance and
friendship he would have been so [[happy]] to see himself established, as in
your own.  but if any [[man]] is offended by the [[freedom]] which i use with the
belongings of another, i can tell him that nothing which has been written
or been laid down, even in the schools of [[philosophy]], respecting the
sacred duties [[duty]] and rights [[right]] of [[friendship]], could give an adequate [[idea]] of
the relations which subsisted between this personage and myself.

moreover, sir, this slender gift, to make two throws of one stone at the
same [[time]], may likewise serve, if you please, to testify the [[honour]] and
respect which i entertain for your ability and high qualities; for as to
those gifts which are adventitious and accidental, it is not to my taste
to take them into account.

sir, i [[pray]] [[god]] to grant you a very [[happy]] and a very long [[life]].  from
montaigne, this 30th of april 1570.--your humble and [[obedient]] servant,

michel de montaigne.




to monsieur, monsieur de folx, privy councillor, and ambassador of his
majesty to the signory of venice.--[ printed before the ‘vers francois’
of etienne de la boetie, 8vo, [[paris]], 1572.]

sir,--being on the point of commending to you and to [[posterity]] the memory
of the late etienne de la boetie, as well for his extreme [[virtue]] as for
the singular affection which he bore to me, it struck me as an
indiscretion very serious in its results, and meriting some coercion from
our laws [[law]], the practice which often prevails of robbing [[virtue]] of [[glory]],
its faithful associate, in order to confer it, in accordance with our
private interests and without discrimination, on the first comer; seeing
that our two principal guiding reins are [[reward]] and [[punishment]], which
only touch us properly, and as [[men]], through the medium of [[honour]] and
dishonour, forasmuch as these penetrate the [[mind]], and come [[home]] to our
most intimate feelings: just where animals themselves are susceptible,
more or less, to all other kinds [[kind]] of recompense and corporal chastisement.
moreover, it is well to notice that the custom of praising [[virtue]], even
in those who are no longer with us, impalpable as it is to them, serves
as a stimulant to the living to imitate their [[example]]; just as capital
sentences are carried out by the [[law]], more for the sake of warning to
others, than in relation to those who suffer.  now, commendation and its
opposite being analogous as regards effects, we cannot easily deny
the [[fact]], that although the [[law]] prohibits one [[man]] from slandering the
reputation of another, it does not prevent us from bestowing reputation
without cause.  this pernicious licence in [[respect]] to the distribution of
praise, has formerly been confined in its area of operations; and it may
be the [[reason]] why poetry once lost favour with the more judicious.
however this may be, it cannot be concealed that the [[vice]] of falsehood is
one very unbecoming in gentleman, let it assume what guise it will.

as for that personage of whom i am speaking to you, sir he leads me far
away indeed from this [[kind]] of [[language]]; for the danger in his case is
not, lest i should lend him anything, but that i might take something
from him; and it is his ill-fortune that, while he has supplied me, so
far as ever a [[man]] could, with just and obvious opportunities for
commendation, i find myself unable and unqualified to render it to him
--i, who am his debtor for so many vivid communications, and who alone
have it in my [[power]] to [[answer]] for a million of accomplishments,
perfections, and virtues [[virtue]], latent (thanks to his unkind stars) in so noble
a [[soul]].  for the [[nature]] of things having (i [[know]] not how) permitted that
truth, [[fair]] and acceptable--as it may be of itself, is only embraced
where there are [[arts]] of persuasion, to insinuate it into our minds [[mind]], i see
myself so wanting, both in [[authority]] to support my simple testimony, and
in the eloquence requisite for lending it value and weight, that i was on
the eve of relinquishing the task, having nothing of his which would
enable me to exhibit to the [[world]] a proof of his genius and [[knowledge]].

in [[truth]], sir, having been overtaken by his [[fate]] in the flower of his
age, and in the full enjoyment of the most vigorous health, it had been
his design to publish some day works [[work]] which would have demonstrated to
posterity what sort of a [[man]] he was; and, peradventure, he was
indifferent enough to fame, having formed such a plan in his head, to
proceed no further in it.  but i have come to the conclusion, that it was
far more excusable in him to bury with him all his rare endowments, than
it would be on my part to bury also with me the [[knowledge]] of them which i
had acquired from him; and, therefore, having collected with [[care]] all the
remains which i found scattered here and there among his papers, i intend
to distribute them so as to recommend his memory to as many persons [[person]] as
possible, selecting the most suitable and worthy of my acquaintance, and
those whose testimony might do him [[greatest]] [[honour]]: such as you, sir, who
may very possibly have had some [[knowledge]] of him during his [[life]], but
assuredly too slight to discover the [[perfect]] extent of his worth.
posterity may credit me, if it chooses, when i swear upon my [[conscience]],
that i knew and saw him to be such as, all things considered, i could
neither [[desire]] nor imagine a genius surpassing his.

i beg you very humbly, sir, not only to take his name under your general
protection, but also these ten or twelve french stanzas, which lay
themselves, as of necessity, under shadow of your patronage.  for i will
not [[disguise]] from you, that their publication was deferred, upon the
appearance of his other writings, under the pretext (as it was alleged
yonder at paris) that they were too crude to come to [[light]].  you will
judge, sir, how much [[truth]] there is in this; and since it is [[thought]] that
hereabout nothing can be produced in our own dialect but what is
barbarous and unpolished, it falls to you, who, besides your rank as the
first house in guienne, indeed down from your [[ancestors]], possess every
other sort of qualification, to establish, not merely by your [[example]],
but by your authoritative testimony, that such is not always the case:
the more so that, though ‘tis more [[natural]] with the gascons to act than
talk, yet sometimes they employ the tongue more than the arm, and wit in
place of valour.

for my own part; sir, it is not in my way to [[judge]] of such matters; but i
have heard persons [[person]] who are supposed to [[understand]] them, say that these
stanzas are not only worthy to be presented in the market-place, but,
independently of that, as regards [[beauty]] and [[wealth]] of invention, they
are full of marrow and matter as any compositions of the [[kind]], which have
appeared in our [[language]].  naturally each workman feels [[feel]] himself more
strong in some special part his art [[arts]], and those are to be regarded as most
fortunate, who lay hands on the noblest, for all the parts essential to
the construction of any whole are not equally precious.  we find
elsewhere, perhaps, greater delicacy phrase, greater softness and harmony
of [[language]]; but imaginative grace, and in the store of pointed wit, i do
not [[think]] he has been surpassed; and we should take the account that he
made these things neither his occupation nor his study, and that he
scarcely took a pen in his hand more than once a year, as is shown by the
very slender quantity of his remains.  for you see here, sir, green wood
and dry, without any sort of selection, all that has come into my
possession; insomuch that there are among the rest efforts even of his
boyhood.  in point of [[fact]], he seems to have written them merely to show
that he was capable of dealing with all subjects [[subject]]: for otherwise,
thousands of times [[time]], in the course of ordinary conversation, i have heard
things drop from him infinitely more worthy of being admired, infinitely
more worthy of being preserved.

such, sir, is what [[justice]] and affection, forming in this instance a rare
conjunction, oblige me to say of this [[great]] and [[good]] [[man]]; and if i have
at all offended by the [[freedom]] which i have taken in addressing myself to
you on such a [[subject]] at such a length, be pleased to recollect that the
principal result of greatness and eminence is to lay one open to
importunate appeals on behalf of the rest of the [[world]].  herewith, after
desiring you to accept my affectionate devotion to your service,
i beseech [[god]] to vouchsafe you, sir, a fortunate and prolonged [[life]].
from montaigne, this 1st of september 1570.--your [[obedient]] servant,

michel de montaigne.





to mademoiselle de montaigne, my [[wife]].--[printed as a preface to the
“consolation of plutarch to his [[wife]],” published by montaigne, with
several other tracts by la boetie, about 1571.]

my [[wife]],--you [[understand]] well that it is not proper for a [[man]] of the
world, according to the rules [[rule]] of this our [[time]], to continue to court and
caress you; for they say that a sensible [[person]] may take a [[wife]] indeed,
but that to espouse her is to act like a [[fool]].  let them talk; i adhere
for my part the custom of the [[good]] old days; i also wear my hair as it
used to be then; and, in [[truth]], novelty costs this [[poor]] [[country]] up to the
present moment so dear (and i do not [[know]] whether we have reached the
highest pitch yet), that everywhere and in everything i renounce the
fashion.  let us [[live]], my [[wife]], you and i, in the old french method.
now, you may recollect that the late m. de la boetie, my [[brother]] and
inseparable companion, gave me, on his death-bed, all his books [[book]] and
papers, which have remained ever since the most precious part of my
effects.  i do not [[wish]] to keep them niggardly to myself alone, nor do i
deserve to have the exclusive use of them; so that i have resolved to
communicate them to my [[friends]]; and because i have none, i [[believe]], more
particularly intimate you, i send you the consolatory letter written by
plutarch to his [[wife]], translated by him into french; regretting much that
fortune has made it so suitable a [[present]] you, and that, having had but
one child, and that a [[daughter]], long looked for, after four years of your
married [[life]] it was your lot to lose her in the second year of her [[age]].
but i leave to plutarch the [[duty]] of comforting you, acquainting you with
your [[duty]] herein, begging you to put your [[faith]] in him for my sake; for
he will reveal to you my own ideas [[idea]], and will express the matter far
better than i should myself.  hereupon, my [[wife]], i commend myself very
heartily to your [[good]] will, and [[pray]] [[god]] to have you in his keeping.
from [[paris]], this 10th september 1570.--your [[good]] husband,

michel de montaigne.




viii.

to monsieur dupuy,--[this is probably the claude dupuy, born at [[paris]] in
1545, and one of the fourteen judges [[judge]] sent into guienne after the treaty
of fleix in 1580.  it was perhaps under these circumstances that
montaigne addressed to him the [[present]] letter.]--the king’s councillor in
his court and [[parliament]] of [[paris]].

monsieur,--the [[business]] of the sieur de verres, a [[prisoner]], who is
extremely well known to me, deserves, in the arrival at a decision,
the exercise of the clemency [[natural]] to you, if, in the [[public]] interest,
you can fairly call it into play.  he has done a thing not only
excusable, according to the [[military]] laws [[law]] of this [[age]], but necessary and
(as we are of opinion) commendable.  he committed the act, without [[doubt]],
unwillingly and under pressure; there is no other passage of his life
which is open to reproach.  i beseech you, sir, to lend the matter your
attentive consideration; you will find the [[character]] of it as i represent
it to you.  he is persecuted on this crime, in a way which is far worse
than the offence itself.  if it is likely to be of use to him, i desire
to inform you that he is a [[man]] brought up in my house, related to several
respectable families [[family]], and a [[person]] who, having [[led]] an honourable [[life]],
is my particular friend.  by saving him you lay me under an extreme
obligation.  i beg you very humbly to regard him as recommended by me,
and, after kissing your hands, i [[pray]] [[god]], sir, to grant you a long and
happy [[life]].  from castera, this 23d of april [1580].  your affectionate
servant,
montaigne.





ix.

to the jurats of bordeaux.--[published from the original among the
archives of the town of bordeaux, m. gustave brunet in the bulletin du
bibliophile, july 1839.]

gentlemen,--i trust that the [[journey]] of monsieur de cursol will be of
advantage to the town.  having in hand a case so just and so favourable,
you did all in your [[power]] to put the [[business]] in [[good]] trim; and matters
being so well situated, i beg you to excuse my absence for some little
time longer, and i will abridge my stay so far as the pressure of my
affairs permits.  i [[hope]] that the delay will be short; however, you will
keep me, if you please, in your [[good]] grace, and will command me, if the
occasion shall arise, in employing me in the [[public]] service and in yours.
monsieur de cursol has also written to me and apprised me of his [[journey]].
i humbly commend myself to you, and [[pray]] [[god]], gentlemen, to grant you
long and [[happy]] [[life]].  from montaigne, this 21st of may 1582.  your humble
brother and servant,
montaigne.




x.

to the same.--[the original is among the archives of toulouse.]

gentlemen,--i have taken my [[fair]] share of the satisfaction which you
announce to me as feeling at the [[good]] despatch of your [[business]], as
reported to you by your deputies, and i regard it as a favourable sign
that you have made such an auspicious commencement of the year.  i hope
to join you at the earliest convenient opportunity.  i recommend myself
very humbly to your gracious consideration, and [[pray]] [[god]] to grant you,
gentlemen, a [[happy]] and long [[life]].  from montaigne, this 8th february
1585.  your humble [[brother]] and servant,
montaigne.




xi.

to the same.

gentlemen,--i have here received news of you from m. le marechal.  i will
not spare either my [[life]] or anything else for your service, and will
leave it to your [[judgment]] whether the assistance i might be able to
render by my presence at the forthcoming election, would be worth the
risk i should run by going into the town, seeing the [[bad]] [[state]] it is in,
--[this refers to the plague then raging, and which carried off 14,000
persons at bordeaux.]--particularly for [[people]] coming away from so fine
an air as this is where i am.  i will draw as near to you on wednesday as
i can, that is, to feuillas, if the malady has not reached that place,
where, as i write to m. de la molte, i shall be very pleased to have the
honour of seeing one of you to take your directions, and relieve myself
of the credentials which m. le marechal will give me for you all:
commending myself hereupon humbly to your [[good]] grace, and praying [[god]] to
grant you, gentlemen, long and [[happy]] [[life]].  at libourne, this 30th of
july 1585.  your humble servant and [[brother]],
montaigne.




xii.--[“according to dr. payen, this letter belongs to 1588.  its
authenticity has been called in [[question]]; but wrongly, in our [[opinion]].
see ‘documents inedits’, 1847, p.  12.”--note in ‘essais’, ed.  [[paris]],
1854, iv.  381.  it does not appear to whom the letter was addressed.]

monseigneur,--you have heard of our baggage being taken from us under our
eyes in the forest of villebois: then, after a [[good]] deal of discussion
and delay, of the capture being pronounced illegal by the [[prince]].  we
dared not, however, proceed on our way, from an uncertainty as to the
safety of our persons [[person]], which should have been clearly expressed on our
passports.  the league has done this, m. de barrant and m. de la
rochefocault; the storm has burst on me, who had my [[money]] in my box.  i
have recovered none of it, and most of my papers and cash--[the french
word is hardes, which st. john renders things.  but compare chambers’s
“domestic annals of [[scotland]],” 2d ed.  i.  48.]--remain in their
possession.  i have not seen the [[prince]].  fifty were lost .  .  .  as for
the count of thorigny, he lost some ver plate and a few articles of
clothing.  he diverged from his route to [[pay]] a visit to the mourning
ladies at montresor, where are the remains of his two brothers [[brother]] and his
grandmother, and came to us again in this town, whence we shall resume
our [[journey]] shortly.  the [[journey]] to normandy is postponed.  the [[king]] has
despatched mm. de bellieure and de la guiche to m. de guise to summon him
to court; we shall be there on thursday.

from orleans, this 16th of february, in the morning [1588-9?].--your very
humble servant,
montaigne.





xiii.

to mademoiselle paulmier.--[this letter, at the [[time]] of the publication
of the variorum edition of 1854, appears to have been in private hands.
see vol.  iv.  p.  382.]

mademoiselle,--my [[friends]] [[know]] that, from the first moment of our
acquaintance, i have destined a copy of my [[book]] for you; for i [[feel]] that
you have done it much [[honour]].  the courtesy of m. paulmier would deprive
me of the [[pleasure]] of giving it to you now, for he has obliged me since a
great deal beyond the worth of my [[book]].  you will accept it then, if you
please, as having been yours before i owed it to you, and will confer on
me the favour of loving it, whether for its own sake or for mine; and i
will keep my debt to m. paulmier undischarged, that i may requite him, if
i have at some other [[time]] the means of serving him.




xiv.

to the [[king]], henry iv.--[the original is in the french national library,
in the dupuy collection.  it was first discovered by m. achille jubinal,
who printed it with a facsimile of the entire autograph, in 1850.  st.
john gives the date wrongly as the 1st january 1590.]

sire, it is to be above the weight and crowd of your [[great]] and important
affairs, to [[know]], as you do, how to lend yourself, and attend to small
matters in their turn, according to the [[duty]] of your [[royal]] [[dignity]], which
exposes you at all times [[time]] to every description and [[degree]] of [[person]] and
employment.  yet, that your majesty should have deigned to consider my
letter, and direct a reply to be made to it, i prefer to owe, less to
your [[strong]] understanding, than to your [[kindness]] of [[heart]].  i have always
looked forward to your enjoyment of your [[present]] [[fortune]], and you may
recollect that, even when i had to make [[confession]] of itto my cure, i
viewed your successes with satisfaction: now, with the greater propriety
and [[freedom]], i embrace them affectionately.  they serve you where you are
as positive matters of [[fact]]; but they serve us here no less by the fame
which they diffuse: the echo carries as much weight as the blow.  we
should not be able to derive from the [[justice]] of your cause such powerful
arguments for the maintenance and reduction of your subjects [[subject]], as we do
from the reports of the [[success]] of your undertaking; and then i have to
assure your majesty, that the recent changes [[change]] to your advantage, which you
observe hereabouts, the prosperous issue of your proceedings at dieppe,
have opportunely seconded the honest zeal and marvellous prudence of m.
the marshal de matignon, from whom i flatter myself that you do not
receive day by day accounts of such [[good]] and signal services without
remembering my assurances and expectations.  i look to the next summer,
not only for fruits which we may [[eat]], but for those to grow out of our
common tranquillity, and that it will pass over our heads with the same
even tenor of [[happiness]], dissipating, like its predecessors, all the fine
promises with which your adversaries sustain the spirits of their
followers.  the popular inclinations resemble a tidal wave; if the
current once commences in your favour, it will go on of its own [[force]] to
the end.  i could have [[desired]] much that the private gain of the soldiers
of your [[army]], and the necessity for satisfying them, had not deprived
you, especially in this principal town, of the glorious credit of treating
your mutinous subjects [[subject]], in the midst of [[victory]], with greater clemency
than their own protectors, and that, as distinguished from a passing and
usurped repute, you could have shown them to be really your own, by the
exercise of a protection truly paternal and [[royal]].  in the conduct of
such affairs as you have in hand, [[men]] are obliged to have recourse to
unusual expedients.  it is always seen that they are surmounted by their
magnitude and difficulty; it not being found easy to complete the
conquest by arms and [[force]], the end has been accomplished by clemency and
generosity, excellent lures to draw [[men]] particularly towards the just and
legitimate side.  if there is to be severity and [[punishment]], let it be
deferred till [[success]] has been assured.  a [[great]] conqueror of [[past]] times
boasts that he gave his enemies [[enemy]] as [[great]] an inducement to [[love]] him, as
his [[friends]].  and here we [[feel]] already some effect of the favourable
impression produced upon our rebellious towns by the contrast between
their rude treatment, and that of those which are [[loyal]] to you.  desiring
your majesty a [[happiness]] more tangible and less hazardous, and that you
may be beloved rather than feared by your [[people]], and believing that your
welfare and theirs are of necessity knit together, i rejoice to [[think]] that
the [[progress]] which you make is one towards more practicable conditions of
peace, as well as towards victory!

sire, your letter of the [[last]] of november came to my hand only just now,
when the [[time]] which it pleased you to name for meeting you at tours had
already passed.  i take it as a singular favour that you should have
deigned to [[desire]] a visit from so useless a [[person]], but one who is wholly
yours, and more so even by affection than from [[duty]].  you have acted very
commendably in adapting yourself, in the matter of external forms, to
your new fortunes [[fortune]]; but the preservation of your old affability and
frankness in private intercourse is entitled to an [[equal]] share of [[praise]].
you have condescended to take [[thought]] for my [[age]], no less than for the
desire which i have to see you, where you may be at rest from these
laborious agitations.  will not that be soon at [[paris]], sire?  and may
nothing prevent me from presenting myself there!--your very humble and
very [[obedient]] servant and [[subject]],
montaigne.

from montaigne, this 18th of january [1590].




xv.
to the same.--[ this letter is also in the national collection, among the
dupuy papers.  it was first printed in the “journal de l’instruction
publique,” 4th november 1846.]

sire,--the letter which it pleased your majesty to write to me on the
20th of july, was not delivered to me till this morning, and found me
laid up with a very [[violent]] tertian ague, a complaint very [[common]] in this
part of the [[country]] during the [[last]] month.  sire, i consider myself
greatly honoured by the receipt of your commands, and i have not omitted
to communicate to m. the marshal de matignon three times [[time]] most
emphatically my intention and obligation to proceed to him, and even so
far as to indicate the route by which i proposed to join him secretly, if
he [[thought]] proper.  having received no [[answer]], i consider that he has
weighed the difficulty and risk of the [[journey]] to me.  sire, your majesty
dill do me the favour to [[believe]], if you please, that i shall never
complain of the expense on occasions [[occasion]] where i should not hesitate to
devote my [[life]].  i have never derived any substantial benefit whatever
from the bounty of kings [[king]], which i have neither sought nor merited; nor
have i had any recompense for the services which i have performed for
them: whereof your majesty is in part aware.  what i have done for your
predecessors i shall do still more readily for you.  i am as [[rich]], sire,
as i [[desire]] to be.  when i shall have exhausted my purse in attendance on
your majesty at [[paris]], i will take the [[liberty]] to tell you, and then, if
you should regard me as worthy of being retained any longer in your
suite, you will find me more modest in my claims upon you than the
humblest of your officers.

sire, i [[pray]] [[god]] for your [[prosperity]] and health.  your very humble and
very [[obedient]] servant and [[subject]],
montaigne.

from montaigne, this 2d of september [1590].




xvi.

to the governor of guienne.

monseigneur,--i have received this morning your letter, which i have
communicated to m. de gourgues, and we have dined together at the house
of m.[the mayor] of bourdeaux.  as to the inconvenience of transporting
the [[money]] named in your memorandum, you see how difficult a thing it is
to provide for; but you may be sure that we shall keep as close a watch
over it as possible.  i used every exertion to discover the [[man]] of whom
you spoke.  he has not been here; and m. de bordeaux has shown me a
letter in which he mentions that he could not come to see the director of
bordeaux, as he intended, having been informed that you mistrust him.
the letter is of the day before yesterday.  if i could have found him, i
might perhaps have pursued the gentler course, being uncertain of your
views; but i entreat you nevertheless to [[feel]] no manner of [[doubt]] that i
refuse to carry out any wishes [[wish]] of yours, and that, where your commands
are concerned, i [[know]] no distinction of [[person]] or matter.  i [[hope]] that
you have in guienne many as well affected to you as i am.  they report
that the nantes galleys are advancing towards brouage.  m. the marshal de
biron has not yet left.  those who were charged to convey the message to
m. d’usee say that they cannot find him; and i [[believe]] that, if he has
been here, he is so no longer.  we keep a vigilant eye on our gates and
guards, and we look after them a little more attentively in your absence,
which makes me apprehensive, not merely on account of the preservation of
the town, but likewise for your oven sake, knowing that the enemies [[enemy]] of
the [[king]] [[feel]] how necessary you are to his service, and how ill we should
prosper without you.  i am afraid that, in the part where you are, you
will be overtaken by so many affairs requiring your attention on every
side, that it will take you a long [[time]] and involve [[great]] difficulty
before you have disposed of everything.  if there is any important news,
i will despatch an express at once, and you may conclude that nothing is
stirring if you do not hear from me: at the same [[time]] begging you to bear
in [[mind]] that movements of this [[kind]] are wont to be so sudden and
unexpected that, if they occur, they will grasp me by the throat, before
they say a word.  i will do what i can to collect news, and for this
purpose i will make a point of visiting and seeing [[men]] of every shade of
opinion.  down to the [[present]] [[time]] nothing is stirring.  m. de londel has
seen me this morning, and we have been arranging for some advances for
the place, where i shall go to-morrow morning.  since i began this
letter, i have learnt from chartreux that two gentlemen, describing
themselves as in the service of m. de guise, and coming from agen, have
passed near chartreux; but i was not able to ascertain which road they
have taken.  they are expecting you at agen.  the sieur de mauvesin came
as far as canteloup, and thence returned, having got some [[intelligence]].
i am in search of one captain rous, to whom .  .  .  wrote, trying to
draw him into his cause by all sorts of promises.  the rumour of the two
nantes galleys ready to descend on brouage is confirmed as [[certain]]; they
carry two companies of foot.  m. de mercure is at nantes.  the sieur de
la courbe said to m. the president nesmond that m. d’elbeuf is on this
side of angiers, and lodges with his [[father]].  he is drawing towards lower
poictou with 4000 foot and 400 or 500 horse, having been reinforced by
the [[troops]] of m. de brissac and others, and m. de mercure is to join him.
the report goes also that m. du maine is about to take the command of all
the forces [[force]] they have collected in auvergne, and that he will cross le
foret to advance on rouergue and us, that is to say, on the [[king]] of
navarre, against whom all this is being directed.  m. de lansac is at
bourg, and has two [[war]] vessels, which remain in attendance on him.  his
functions are naval.  i tell you what i learn, and mix up together the
more or less probable hearsay of the town with actual matter of [[fact]],
that you may be in possession of everything.  i beg you most humbly to
return directly affairs may allow you to do so, and assure you that,
meanwhile, we shall not spare our [[labour]], or (if that were necessary) our
life, to maintain the king’s [[authority]] throughout.  monseigneur, i kiss
your hands very respectfully, and [[pray]] [[god]] to have you in his keeping.
from bordeaux, wednesday night, 22d may (1590-91).--your very humble
servant,

montaigne.

i have seen no one from the [[king]] of navarre; they say that m. de biron
has seen him.






            the author to the reader.--[omitted by cotton.]

reader, thou hast here an honest [[book]]; it doth at the outset forewarn
thee that, in contriving the same, i have proposed to myself no other
than a domestic and private end: i have had no consideration at all
either to thy service or to my [[glory]].  my powers [[power]] are not capable of any
such design.  i have dedicated it to the particular commodity of my
kinsfolk and [[friends]], so that, having lost me (which they must do
shortly), they may therein recover some traits of my conditions and
humours, and by that means preserve more whole, and more life-like, the
knowledge they had of me.  had my intention been to seek the world’s
favour, i should surely have adorned myself with borrowed beauties [[beauty]]: i
desire therein to be viewed as i appear in mine own [[genuine]], simple, and
ordinary manner, without study and artifice: for it is myself i paint.
my defects are therein to be [[read]] to the [[life]], and any imperfections and
my [[natural]] form, so far as [[public]] reverence hath permitted me.  if i had
lived among those nations, which (they say) yet dwell under the sweet
liberty of nature’s primitive laws [[law]], i assure thee i would most willingly
have painted myself quite fully and quite naked.  thus, reader, myself am
the matter of my [[book]]: there’s no [[reason]] thou shouldst employ thy leisure
about so frivolous and [[vain]] a [[subject]].   therefore farewell.

that [[men]] by various ways arrive at the same end.

the most usual way of appeasing the indignation of such as we have any
way offended, when we see them in possession of the [[power]] of [[revenge]],
and find that we absolutely [[lie]] at their [[mercy]], is by submission, to move
them to commiseration and [[pity]]; and yet bravery, constancy, and
resolution, however quite contrary means, have sometimes served to
produce the same effect.--[florio’s version begins thus: “the most
vsuall waie to appease those minds [[mind]] wee have offended, when [[revenge]] lies
in their hands, and that we stand at their mercie, is by submission to
move them to commiseration and [[pity]]: nevertheless, [[courage]], constancie,
and resolution (means altogether opposite) have sometimes wrought the
same effect.”--] [the spelling is florio’s d.w.]

edward, [[prince]] of wales [edward, the black [[prince]].  d.w.] (the same who
so long governed our guienne, a personage whose condition and fortune
have in them a [[great]] deal of the most notable and most considerable parts
of grandeur), having been highly incensed by the limousins, and taking
their [[city]] by assault, was not, either by the cries of the [[people]], or the
prayers and tears of the [[women]] and [[children]], abandoned to slaughter and
prostrate at his feet for [[mercy]], to be stayed from prosecuting his
revenge; till, penetrating further into the town, he at [[last]] took notice
of three french gentlemen,--[these were jean de villemure, hugh de la
roche, and roger de beaufort.--froissart, i. c. 289. {the [[city]] was
limoges.  d.w.}]--who with incredible bravery alone sustained the power
of his victorious [[army]].  then it was that consideration and [[respect]] unto
so remarkable a valour first stopped the torrent of his fury, and that
his clemency, beginning with these three cavaliers, was afterwards
extended to all the remaining inhabitants of the [[city]].

scanderbeg, [[prince]] of epirus, pursuing one of his soldiers with purpose
to kill him, the soldier, having in [[vain]] tried by all the ways of
humility and supplication to appease him, resolved, as his [[last]] refuge,
to face about and await him [[sword]] in hand: which behaviour of his gave a
sudden stop to his captain’s fury, who, for seeing him assume so notable
a resolution, received him into grace; an [[example]], however, that might
suffer another interpretation with such as have not [[read]] of the
prodigious [[force]] and valour of that [[prince]].

the [[emperor]] conrad iii. having besieged guelph, duke of bavaria,--[in
1140, in weinsberg, upper bavaria.]--would not be prevailed upon, what
mean and unmanly satisfactions soever were tendered to him, to condescend
to milder conditions than that the ladies [[lady]] and gentlewomen only who were
in the town with the duke might go out without violation of their [[honour]],
on foot, and with so much only as they could carry about them.  whereupon
they, out of magnanimity of [[heart]], presently contrived to carry out, upon
their shoulders, their husbands and [[children]], and the duke himself;
a sight at which the [[emperor]] was so pleased, that, ravished with the
generosity of the action, he wept for joy, and immediately extinguishing
in his [[heart]] the mortal and [[capital]] [[hatred]] he had conceived against this
duke, he from that [[time]] forward treated him and his with all [[humanity]].
the one and the other of these two ways would with [[great]] facility work
upon my [[nature]]; for i have a marvellous propensity to [[mercy]] and mildness,
and to such a [[degree]] that i fancy of the two i should sooner [[surrender]] my
anger to compassion than to esteem.  and yet [[pity]] is reputed a vice
amongst the stoics, who will that we succour the afflicted, but not that
we should be so affected with their sufferings as to suffer with them.
i conceived these examples [[example]] not ill suited to the [[question]] in hand, and
the rather because therein we observe these [[great]] souls [[soul]] assaulted and
tried by these two several ways, to resist the one without relenting, and
to be shook and subjected by the other.  it may be true that to suffer a
man’s [[heart]] to be totally subdued by compassion may be imputed to
facility, effeminacy, and over-tenderness; whence it comes to pass that
the weaker natures [[nature]], as of [[women]], [[children]], and the [[common]] sort of [[people]],
are the most [[subject]] to it but after having resisted and disdained the
power of groans and tears, to yield to the sole reverence of the sacred
image of valour, this can be no other than the effect of a [[strong]] and
inflexible [[soul]] enamoured of and honouring masculine and obstinate
courage.  nevertheless, astonishment and admiration may, in less generous
minds, beget a like effect: witness the [[people]] of thebes, who, having put
two of their generals upon [[trial]] for their lives [[life]] for having continued in
arms beyond the precise term of their commission, very hardly pardoned
pelopidas, who, bowing under the weight of so dangerous an accusation,
made no manner of defence for himself, nor produced other arguments than
prayers and supplications; whereas, on the contrary, epaminondas, falling
to recount magniloquently the exploits he had performed in their service,
and, after a haughty and arrogant manner reproaching them with
ingratitude and [[injustice]], they had not the [[heart]] to proceed any further
in his [[trial]], but broke up the court and departed, the whole assembly
highly commending the high [[courage]] of this personage.--[plutarch, how
far a [[man]] may [[praise]] himself, c. 5.]

dionysius the elder, after having, by a tedious siege and through
exceeding [[great]] difficulties, taken the [[city]] of reggio, and in it the
governor phyton, a very gallant [[man]], who had made so obstinate a defence,
was resolved to make him a tragical [[example]] of his [[revenge]]: in order
whereunto he first told him, “that he had the day before caused his son
and all his kindred to be drowned.”  to which phyton returned no other
answer but this: “that they were then by one day happier than he.”  after
which, causing him to be stripped, and delivering him into the hands of
the tormentors, he was by them not only dragged through the streets of
the town, and most ignominiously and cruelly whipped, but moreover
vilified with most bitter and contumelious [[language]]: yet still he
maintained his [[courage]] entire all the way, with a [[strong]] voice and
undaunted countenance proclaiming the honourable and glorious cause of
his [[death]]; namely, for that he would not deliver up his [[country]] into the
hands of a [[tyrant]]; at the same [[time]] denouncing against him a speedy
chastisement from the offended gods.  at which dionysius, reading in his
soldiers’ looks, that instead of being incensed at the haughty language
of this conquered [[enemy]], to the contempt of their captain and his
triumph, they were not only struck with admiration of so rare a [[virtue]],
but moreover inclined to mutiny, and were even ready to rescue the
prisoner out of the hangman’s hands, he caused the torturing to cease,
and afterwards privately caused him to be thrown into the sea.--[diod.
sic., xiv. 29.]

man (in [[good]] earnest) is a marvellous [[vain]], fickle, and unstable [[subject]],
and on whom it is very hard to form any [[certain]] and uniform [[judgment]].
for pompey could pardon the whole [[city]] of the mamertines, though
furiously incensed against it, upon the [[single]] account of the [[virtue]] and
magnanimity of one citizen, zeno,--[plutarch calls him stheno, and also
sthemnus and sthenis]--who took the [[fault]] of the [[public]] wholly upon
himself; neither entreated other favour, but alone to undergo the
punishment for all: and yet sylla’s host, having in the [[city]] of perugia
--[plutarch says preneste, a town of latium.]--manifested the same
virtue, obtained nothing by it, either for himself or his
fellow-citizens.

and, directly contrary to my first examples [[example]], the bravest of all [[men]], and
who was reputed so gracious to all those he overcame, alexander, having,
after many [[great]] difficulties, forced the [[city]] of gaza, and, entering,
found betis, who commanded there, and of whose valour in the [[time]] of this
siege he had most marvellous manifest proof, alone, forsaken by all his
soldiers, his armour hacked and hewed to pieces, covered all over with
blood and wounds, and yet still fighting in the crowd of a number of
macedonians, who were laying on him on all sides, he said to him, nettled
at so dear-bought a [[victory]] (for, in addition to the other damage, he had
two wounds newly received in his own person), “thou shalt not [[die]], betis,
as thou dost intend; be sure thou shall suffer all the torments that can
be inflicted on a captive.”  to which menace the other returning no other
answer, but only a fierce and disdainful look; “what,” says alexander,
observing his haughty and obstinate [[silence]], “is he too stiff to bend a
knee!  is he too proud to utter one suppliant word!  truly, i will
conquer this [[silence]]; and if i cannot [[force]] a word from his mouth, i
will, at least, extract a groan from his [[heart]].”  and thereupon
converting his anger into fury, presently commanded his heels to be bored
through, causing him, alive, to be dragged, mangled, and dismembered at a
cart’s tail.--[quintus curtius, iv. 6.  this act of [[cruelty]] has been
doubted, notwithstanding the statement of curtius.]--was it that the
height of [[courage]] was so [[natural]] and familiar to this conqueror, that
because he could not [[admire]], he respected it the less?  or was it that he
conceived valour to be a [[virtue]] so peculiar to himself, that his pride
could not, without envy, endure it in another?  or was it that the
natural impetuosity of his fury was incapable of opposition?  certainly,
had it been capable of moderation, it is to be believed that in the sack
and desolation of thebes, to see so many valiant [[men]], lost and totally
destitute of any further defence, cruelly massacred before his [[eyes]],
would have appeased it: where there were above six thousand put to the
sword, of whom not one was seen to fly, or heard to cry out for quarter;
but, on the contrary, every one running here and there to seek out and to
provoke the victorious [[enemy]] to [[help]] them to an honourable end.  not one
was seen who, however weakened with wounds, did not in his [[last]] gasp yet
endeavour to [[revenge]] himself, and with all the arms of a brave despair,
to sweeten his own [[death]] in the [[death]] of an [[enemy]].  yet did their valour
create no [[pity]], and the length of one day was not enough to satiate the
thirst of the conqueror’s [[revenge]], but the slaughter continued to the
last drop of [[blood]] that was capable of being shed, and stopped not till
it met with none but unarmed persons [[person]], old [[men]], [[women]], and [[children]], of
them to carry away to the number of thirty thousand slaves [[slave]].




chapter ii

of sorrow

no [[man]] living is more [[free]] from this passion than i, who yet neither like
it in myself nor [[admire]] it in others, and yet generally the [[world]], as a
settled thing, is pleased to grace it with a particular esteem, clothing
therewith [[wisdom]], [[virtue]], and [[conscience]].  foolish and sordid guise!
--[“no [[man]] is more [[free]] from this passion than i, for i neither [[love]] nor
regard it: albeit the [[world]] hath undertaken, as it were upon covenant, to
grace it with a particular favour.  therewith they adorne [[age]], vertue,
and [[conscience]].  oh foolish and base ornament!”  florio, 1613, p. 3]
--the italians have more fitly baptized by this name--[la tristezza]--
malignity; for ‘tis a quality always hurtful, always idle and [[vain]]; and
as being cowardly, mean, and base, it is by the stoics expressly and
particularly forbidden to their sages.

but the story--[herodotus, iii.  14.]--says that psammenitus, [[king]] of
egypt, being defeated and taken [[prisoner]] by cambyses, [[king]] of [[persia]],
seeing his own [[daughter]] pass by him as [[prisoner]], and in a wretched habit,
with a bucket to draw water, though his [[friends]] about him were so
concerned as to break out into tears and lamentations, yet he himself
remained unmoved, without uttering a word, his [[eyes]] fixed upon the
ground; and seeing, moreover, his [[son]] immediately after [[led]] to execution,
still maintained the same countenance; till spying at [[last]] one of his
domestic and familiar [[friends]] dragged away amongst the captives, he fell
to tearing his hair and beating his breast, with all the other
extravagances of extreme [[sorrow]].

a story that may very fitly be coupled with another of the same [[kind]], of
recent date, of a [[prince]] of our own nation, who being at trent, and
having news there brought him of the [[death]] of his elder [[brother]], a
brother on whom depended the whole support and [[honour]] of his house, and
soon after of that of a younger [[brother]], the second [[hope]] of his [[family]],
and having withstood these two assaults with an exemplary resolution; one
of his servants happening a few days after to [[die]], he [[suffered]] his
constancy to be overcome by this [[last]] accident; and, parting with his
courage, so abandoned himself to [[sorrow]] and mourning, that some thence
were forward to conclude that he was only touched to the quick by this
last stroke of [[fortune]]; but, in [[truth]], it was, that being before brimful
of [[grief]], the least addition overflowed the bounds of all patience.
which, i [[think]], might also be said of the former [[example]], did not the
story proceed to tell us that cambyses asking psammenitus, “why, not
being moved at the calamity of his [[son]] and [[daughter]], he should with so
great [[impatience]] bear the misfortune of his friend?”  “it is,” answered
he, “because only this [[last]] affliction was to be manifested by tears, the
two first far exceeding all manner of expression.”

and, peradventure, something like this might be working in the fancy of
the ancient painter,--[cicero, de orator., c. 22 ; pliny, xxxv. 10.]--
who having, in the [[sacrifice]] of iphigenia, to represent the [[sorrow]] of the
assistants proportionably to the several degrees [[degree]] of interest every one
had in the [[death]] of this [[fair]] [[innocent]] virgin, and having, in the other
figures, laid out the utmost [[power]] of his art [[arts]], when he came to that of
her [[father]], he drew him with a veil over his face, meaning thereby that
no [[kind]] of countenance was capable of expressing such a [[degree]] of [[sorrow]].
which is also the [[reason]] why the poets feign the miserable [[mother]], niobe,
having first lost seven sons [[son]], and then afterwards as many daughters
(overwhelmed with her losses), to have been at [[last]] transformed into a
rock--

               “diriguisse malis,”

     [“petrified with her misfortunes.”--ovid, met., vi. 304.]

thereby to express that melancholic, dumb, and deaf stupefaction, which
benumbs all our faculties, when [[oppressed]] with accidents greater than we
are able to bear.  and, indeed, the [[violence]] and impression of an
excessive [[grief]] must of necessity astonish the [[soul]], and wholly deprive
her of her ordinary functions: as it happens to every one of us, who,
upon any sudden alarm of very ill news, find ourselves surprised,
stupefied, and in a manner deprived of all [[power]] of motion, so that the
soul, beginning to vent itself in tears and lamentations, seems to free
and disengage itself from the sudden oppression, and to have obtained
some room to [[work]] itself out at greater [[liberty]].

          “et via vix tandem voci laxata dolore est.”

     [“and at length and with difficulty is a passage opened by [[grief]] for
     utterance.”--aeneid, xi. 151.]

in the [[war]] that ferdinand made upon the widow of [[king]] john of hungary,
about buda, a man-at-arms was particularly taken notice of by every one
for his singular gallant behaviour in a [[certain]] encounter; and, unknown,
highly commended, and lamented, being left [[dead]] upon the place: but by
none so much as by raisciac, a [[german]] [[lord]], who was infinitely enamoured
of so rare a valour.  the [[body]] being brought off, and the count, with the
common curiosity coming to view it, the armour was no sooner taken off
but he immediately knew him to be his own [[son]], a thing that added a
second blow to the compassion of all the beholders; only he, without
uttering a word, or turning away his [[eyes]] from the woeful object, stood
fixedly contemplating the [[body]] of his [[son]], till the vehemency of sorrow
having overcome his vital spirits, made him sink down stone-dead to the
ground.

          “chi puo dir com’ egli arde, a in picciol fuoco,”

     [“he who can say how he burns with [[love]], has little fire”
      --petrarca, sonetto 137.]

say the innamoratos, when they would represent an ‘insupportable passion.

                         “misero quod omneis
               eripit sensus mihi: nam simul te,
               lesbia, aspexi, nihil est super mi,
                         quod loquar amens.
               lingua sed torpet: tenuis sub artus
               flamma dimanat; sonitu suopte
               tintinant aures; gemina teguntur
                         lumina nocte.”

     [“love deprives me of all my faculties: lesbia, when once in thy
     presence, i have not left the [[power]] to tell my distracting passion:
     my tongue becomes torpid; a subtle flame creeps through my veins; my
     ears tingle in deafness; my [[eyes]] are veiled with darkness.”
      catullus, epig. li. 5]

neither is it in the height and [[greatest]] fury of the fit that we are in a
condition to pour out our complaints or our amorous persuasions, the soul
being at that [[time]] over-burdened, and labouring with profound thoughts [[thought]];
and the [[body]] dejected and languishing with [[desire]]; and thence it is that
sometimes proceed those accidental impotencies that so unseasonably
surprise the lover, and that frigidity which by the [[force]] of an
immoderate ardour seizes him even in the very lap of fruition.
--[the edition of 1588 has here, “an accident not unknown to myself.”]--
for all [[passions]] that suffer themselves to be relished and digested are
but moderate:

               “curae leves loquuntur, ingentes stupent.”

     [“light griefs can speak: deep sorrows [[sorrow]] are dumb.”
      --seneca, hippolytus, act ii. scene 3.]

a surprise of unexpected joy does likewise often [[produce]] the same effect:

               “ut me conspexit venientem, et troja circum
               arma amens vidit, magnis exterrita monstris,
               diriguit visu in medio, calor ossa reliquit,
               labitur, et longo vix tandem tempore fatur.”

     [“when she beheld me advancing, and saw, with stupefaction, the
     trojan arms around me, terrified with so [[great]] a prodigy, she
     fainted away at the very sight: vital warmth forsook her limbs: she
     sinks down, and, after a long interval, with difficulty speaks.”--
     aeneid, iii. 306.]

besides the examples [[example]] of the roman [[lady]], who died for joy to see her son
safe returned from the defeat of cannae; and of sophocles and of
dionysius the [[tyrant]],--[pliny, vii.  53.  diodorus siculus, however (xv.
c. 20), tells us that dionysius “was so overjoyed at the news that he
made a [[great]] [[sacrifice]] upon it to the gods, prepared sumptuous feasts, to
which he invited all his [[friends]], and therein drank so excessively that
it threw him into a very [[bad]] distemper.”]--who died of joy; and of
thalna, who died in corsica, reading news of the honours [[honour]] the roman senate
had decreed in his favour, we have, moreover, one in our [[time]], of pope
leo x., who upon news of the taking of milan, a thing he had so ardently
desired, was rapt with so sudden an excess of joy that he immediately
fell into a fever and died.--[guicciardini, storia d’italia, vol.
xiv.]--and for a more notable testimony of the imbecility of human
nature, it is recorded by the ancients--[pliny, ‘ut supra’]--that
diodorus the dialectician died upon the spot, out of an extreme passion
of shame, for not having been able in his own school, and in the presence
of a [[great]] auditory, to disengage himself from a nice argument that was
propounded to him.  i, for my part, am very little [[subject]] to these
violent [[passions]]; i am naturally of a stubborn apprehension, which also,
by reasoning, i every day harden and fortify.




chapter iii

that our affections carry themselves beyond us

such as accuse [[mankind]] of the folly of gaping after future things, and
advise us to make our benefit of those which are [[present]], and to set up
our rest upon them, as having no grasp upon that which is to come, even
less than that which we have upon what is [[past]], have hit upon the most
universal of [[human]] errors, if that may be called an error to which nature
herself has disposed us, in order to the continuation of her own [[work]],
prepossessing us, amongst several others, with this deceiving
imagination, as being more [[jealous]] of our action than afraid of our
knowledge.

we are never [[present]] with, but always beyond ourselves: [[fear]], [[desire]],
hope, still push us on towards the future, depriving us, in the meantime,
of the sense and consideration of that which is to amuse us with the
thought of what shall be, even when we shall be no more.--[rousseau,
emile, livre ii.]

          “calamitosus est animus futuri auxius.”

     [“the [[mind]] anxious about the future is unhappy.”
      --seneca, epist., 98.]

we find this [[great]] precept often repeated in [[plato]], “do thine own [[work]],
and [[know]] thyself.”  of which two parts, both the one and the other
generally, comprehend our whole [[duty]], and do each of them in like manner
involve the other; for who will do his own [[work]] aright will find that his
first lesson is to [[know]] what he is, and that which is proper to himself;
and who rightly understands himself will never mistake another man’s work
for his own, but will [[love]] and improve himself above all other things,
will refuse superfluous employments, and reject all unprofitable thoughts
and propositions.  as folly, on the one side, though it should enjoy all
it [[desire]], would notwithstanding never be content, so, on the other,
wisdom, acquiescing in the [[present]], is never dissatisfied with itself.
--[cicero, tusc.  quae., 57, v. 18.]--epicurus dispenses his sages from
all foresight and [[care]] of the future.

amongst those laws [[law]] that relate to the [[dead]], i look upon that to be very
sound by which the actions of princes [[prince]] are to be examined after their
decease.--[diodorus siculus, i. 6.]-- they are equals [[equal]] with, if not
masters of the laws [[law]], and, therefore, what [[justice]] could not inflict upon
their persons [[person]], ‘tis but [[reason]] should be executed upon their reputations
and the estates of their successors--things that we often value above
life itself.  ‘tis a custom of singular advantage to those countries
where it is in use, and by all [[good]] princes [[prince]] to be [[desired]], who have
reason to take it ill, that the memories of the wicked should be used
with the same reverence and [[respect]] with their own.  we owe subjection
and [[obedience]] to all our kings [[king]], whether [[good]] or [[bad]], alike, for that has
respect unto their office; but as to esteem and affection, these are only
due to their [[virtue]].  let us grant to [[political]] [[government]] to endure them
with patience, however unworthy; to conceal their vices [[vice]]; and to assist
them with our recommendation in their indifferent actions, whilst their
authority stands in need of our support.  but, the relation of [[prince]] and
subject being once at an end, there is no [[reason]] we should deny the
expression of our real opinions [[opinion]] to our own [[liberty]] and [[common]] [[justice]],
and especially to interdict to [[good]] subjects [[subject]] the [[glory]] of having
reverently and faithfully served a [[prince]], whose imperfections were to
them so well known; this were to deprive [[posterity]] of a useful [[example]].
and such as, out of [[respect]] to some private obligation, unjustly espouse
and vindicate the memory of a faulty [[prince]], do private [[right]] at the
expense of [[public]] [[justice]].  livy does very truly say,--[xxxv. 48.]--
“that the [[language]] of [[men]] bred up in courts is always full of vain
ostentation and false testimony, every one indifferently magnifying his
own master, and stretching his commendation to the utmost extent of
virtue and [[sovereign]] grandeur.”  some may condemn the [[freedom]] of those
two soldiers who so roundly answered nero to his beard; the one being
asked by him why he bore him ill-will?  “i loved thee,” answered he,
“whilst thou wert worthy of it, but since thou art [[arts]] become a parricide, an
incendiary, a player, and a coachman, i hate thee as thou dost deserve.”
 and the other, why he should attempt to kill him?  “because,” said he,
“i could [[think]] of no other remedy against thy perpetual mischiefs.”
 --[tacitus, annal., xv. 67.]--but the [[public]] and universal testimonies
that were given of him after his [[death]] (and so will be to all [[posterity]],
both of him and all other wicked princes [[prince]] like him), of his tyrannies and
abominable deportment, who, of a sound [[judgment]], can reprove them?

i am scandalised, that in so [[sacred]] a [[government]] as that of the
lacedaemonians there should be mixed so hypocritical a [[ceremony]] at the
interment of their kings [[king]]; where all their confederates and neighbours,
and all sorts and degrees [[degree]] of [[men]] and [[women]], as well as their slaves [[slave]], cut
and slashed their foreheads in token of [[sorrow]], repeating in their cries
and lamentations that that [[king]] (let him have been as wicked as the
devil) was the [[best]] that ever they had;--[herodotus, vi.  68.]--by this
means attributing to his quality the [[praise]] that only belongs to [[merit]],
and that of [[right]] is due to supreme desert, though lodged in the lowest
and most inferior [[subject]].

aristotle, who will still have a hand in everything, makes a ‘quaere’
upon the saying of solon, that none can be said to be [[happy]] until he is
dead: “whether, then, he who has lived and died according to his heart’s
desire, if he have left an ill repute behind him, and that his posterity
be miserable, can be said to be [[happy]]?”  whilst we have [[life]] and motion,
we convey ourselves by fancy and preoccupation, whither and to what we
please; but once out of being, we have no more any manner of
communication with that which is, and it had therefore been [[better]] said
by solon that [[man]] is never [[happy]], because never so, till he is no more.

                              “quisquam
          vix radicitus e vita se tollit, et eicit;
          sed facit esse sui quiddam super inscius ipse,
          nec removet satis a projecto corpore sese, et
          vindicat.”

     [“scarcely one [[man]] can, even in dying, wholly detach himself from
     the [[idea]] of [[life]]; in his ignorance he must needs imagine that there
     is in him something that survives him, and cannot sufficiently
     separate or emancipate himself from his remains”
      --lucretius, iii. 890.]

bertrand de guesclin, dying at the siege of the castle of rancon, near
unto puy, in auvergne, the besieged were afterwards, upon [[surrender]],
enjoined to lay down the keys of the place upon the corpse of the dead
general.  bartolommeo d’alviano, the venetian general, happening to die
in the service of the [[republic]] in brescia, and his corpse being to be
carried through the territory of verona, an enemy’s [[country]], most of the
army were inclined to demand safe-conduct from the veronese; but theodoro
trivulzio opposed the motion, rather choosing to make his way by [[force]] of
arms, and to run the hazard of a [[battle]], saying it was by no means fit
that he who in his [[life]] was never afraid of his enemies [[enemy]] should seem to
apprehend them when he was [[dead]].  in [[truth]], in affairs of the same
nature, by the [[greek]] laws [[law]], he who made suit to an [[enemy]] for a [[body]] to
give it burial renounced his [[victory]], and had no more [[right]] to erect a
trophy, and he to whom such suit was made was reputed victor.  by this
means it was that nicias lost the advantage he had visibly obtained over
the corinthians, and that agesilaus, on the contrary, assured that which
he had before very doubtfully gained over the boeotians.--[plutarch,
life of nicias, c. ii.; [[life]] of agesilaus, c. vi.]

these things might appear [[strange]], had it not been a general practice in
all ages [[age]] not only to extend the concern of ourselves beyond this [[life]],
but, moreover, to fancy that the favour of [[heaven]] does not only very
often accompany us to the grave, but has also, even after [[life]], a concern
for our ashes.  of which there are so many ancient examples [[example]] (to say
nothing of those of our own observation), that it is not necessary i
should longer insist upon it.  edward i., [[king]] of [[england]], having in the
long wars [[war]] betwixt him and robert, [[king]] of [[scotland]], had [[experience]] of how
great importance his own immediate presence was to the [[success]] of his
affairs, having ever been victorious in whatever he undertook in his own
person, when he came to [[die]], bound his [[son]] in a solemn oath that, so soon
as he should be [[dead]] he should boil his [[body]] till the flesh parted from
the bones, and bury the flesh, reserving the bones to carry continually
with him in his [[army]], so often as he should be obliged to go against the
scots, as if [[destiny]] had inevitably attached [[victory]], even to his
remains.  john zisca, the same who, to vindication of wicliffe’s
heresies, troubled the bohemian [[state]], left order that they should flay
him after his [[death]], and of his skin make a drum to carry in the war
against his enemies [[enemy]], fancying it would contribute to the continuation of
the successes he had always obtained in the wars [[war]] against them.  in like
manner [[certain]] of the indians [[indian]], in their battles [[battle]] with the spaniards,
carried with them the bones of one of their captains, in consideration of
the victories [[victory]] they had formerly obtained under his conduct.  and other
people of the same new [[world]] carry about with them, in their wars [[war]], the
relics of valiant [[men]] who have died in [[battle]], to incite their courage
and advance their [[fortune]].  of which examples [[example]] the first reserve nothing
for the tomb but the [[reputation]] they have acquired by their former
achievements, but these attribute to them a [[certain]] [[present]] and active
power.

the proceeding of captain bayard is of a [[better]] composition, who finding
himself wounded to [[death]] with an harquebuss shot, and being importuned to
retire out of the [[fight]], made [[answer]] that he would not begin at the last
gasp to turn his back to the [[enemy]], and accordingly still fought on, till
feeling himself too faint and no longer able to sit on his horse, he
commanded his steward to set him down at the foot of a tree, but so that
he might [[die]] with his face towards the [[enemy]], which he did.

i must yet add another [[example]], equally remarkable for the present
consideration with any of the former.  the [[emperor]] maximilian,
great-grandfather to the now [[king]] philip,--[philip ii. of [[spain]].]--was a
prince endowed throughout with [[great]] and extraordinary qualities, and
amongst the rest with a singular [[beauty]] of [[person]], but had withal a
humour very contrary to that of other princes [[prince]], who for the despatch of
their most important affairs convert their close-stool into a chair of
state, which was, that he would never permit any of his bedchamber, how
familiar soever, to see him in that posture, and would steal aside to
make water as religiously as a virgin, shy to discover to his physician
or any other whomsoever those parts that we are accustomed to conceal.
i myself, who have so impudent a way of talking, am, nevertheless,
naturally so modest this way, that unless at the importunity of necessity
or [[pleasure]], i scarcely ever communicate to the sight of any either those
parts or actions that custom orders us to conceal, wherein i suffer more
constraint than i conceive is very well becoming a [[man]], especially of my
profession.  but he nourished this modest [[humour]] to such a [[degree]] of
superstition as to give express orders in his [[last]] will that they should
put him on drawers so soon as he should be [[dead]]; to which, methinks, he
would have done well to have added that he should be blindfolded, too,
that put them on.  the charge that cyrus left with his [[children]], that
neither they, nor any other, should either see or touch his [[body]] after
the [[soul]] was departed from it,--[xenophon, cyropedia, viii. 7.]--i
attribute to some [[superstitious]] devotion of his; for both his historian
and himself, amongst their [[great]] qualities, marked the whole course of
their lives [[life]] with a singular [[respect]] and reverence to [[religion]].

i was by no means pleased with a story, told me by a [[man]] of very great
quality of a relation of mine, and one who had given a very [[good]] account
of himself both in [[peace]] and [[war]], that, coming to [[die]] in a very old [[age]],
of excessive [[pain]] of the stone, he spent the [[last]] hours of his [[life]] in an
extraordinary solicitude about ordering the [[honour]] and [[ceremony]] of his
funeral, pressing all the [[men]] of condition who came to see him to engage
their word to attend him to his grave: importuning this very [[prince]], who
came to visit him at his [[last]] gasp, with a most earnest supplication that
he would order his [[family]] to be there, and presenting before him several
reasons and examples [[example]] to prove that it was a [[respect]] due to a [[man]] of his
condition; and seemed to [[die]] content, having obtained this promise, and
appointed the method and order of his [[funeral]] parade.  i have seldom
heard of so persistent a vanity.

another, though contrary curiosity (of which singularity, also, i do not
want domestic example), seems to be somewhat akin to this, that a man
shall cudgel his brains at the [[last]] moments of his [[life]] to contrive his
obsequies to so particular and unusual a parsimony as of one servant with
a lantern, i see this [[humour]] commended, and the appointment of marcus.
emilius lepidus, who forbade his heirs to bestow upon his hearse even the
common ceremonies [[ceremony]] in use upon such occasions [[occasion]].  is it yet temperance and
frugality to avoid expense and [[pleasure]] of which the use and knowledge
are imperceptible to us?  see, here, an easy and cheap reformation.  if
instruction were at all necessary in this case, i should be of opinion
that in this, as in all other actions of [[life]], each [[person]] should
regulate the matter according to his [[fortune]]; and the philosopher lycon
prudently ordered his [[friends]] to dispose of his [[body]] where they should
think most fit, and as to his [[funeral]], to order it neither too
superfluous nor too mean.  for my part, i should wholly refer the
ordering of this [[ceremony]] to custom, and shall, when the [[time]] comes,
accordingly leave it to their discretion to whose lot it shall fall to do
me that [[last]] office. “totus hic locus est contemnendus in nobis, non
negligendus in nostris;”--[“the place of our sepulture is to be contemned
by us, but not to be neglected by our [[friends]].”--cicero, tusc. i. 45.]--
and it was a holy saying of a saint, “curatio funeris, conditio
sepultura: pompa exequiarum, magis sunt vivorum solatia, quam subsidia
mortuorum.”--[“the [[care]] of [[death]], the place of sepulture, the pomps of
obsequies, are rather consolations to the living than succours to the
dead.” august. de civit. dei, i.  12.]--which made [[socrates]] answer
crito, who, at [[death]], [[asked]] him how he would be buried: “how you will,”
 said he. “if i were to concern myself beyond the [[present]] about this
affair, i should be most tempted, as the [[greatest]] satisfaction of this
kind, to imitate those who in their lifetime entertain themselves with
the [[ceremony]] and honours [[honour]] of their own obsequies beforehand, and are
pleased with beholding their own [[dead]] countenance in marble.  [[happy]] are
they who can gratify their senses by insensibility, and [[live]] by their
death!”

i am ready to conceive an implacable [[hatred]] against all popular
domination, though i [[think]] it the most [[natural]] and equitable of all, so
oft as i call to [[mind]] the inhuman [[injustice]] of the [[people]] of [[athens]], who,
without remission, or once vouchsafing to hear what they had to say for
themselves, put to [[death]] their brave captains newly returned triumphant
from a naval [[victory]] they had obtained over the lacedaemonians near the
arginusian isles, the most bloody and obstinate engagement that ever the
greeks fought at sea; because (after the victory) they followed up the
blow and pursued the advantages presented to them by the [[rule]] of [[war]],
rather than stay to gather up and bury their [[dead]].  and the execution is
yet rendered more odious by the behaviour of diomedon, who, being one of
the condemned, and a [[man]] of most eminent [[virtue]], [[political]] and [[military]],
after having heard the sentence, advancing to speak, no audience till
then having been allowed, instead of laying before them his own cause,
or the impiety of so cruel a sentence, only expressed a solicitude for
his judges’ preservation, beseeching the gods to convert this sentence to
their [[good]], and praying that, for neglecting to fulfil the vows which he
and his companions had made (with which he also acquainted them) in
acknowledgment of so glorious a [[success]], they might not draw down the
indignation of the gods upon them; and so without more words went
courageously to his [[death]].

fortune, a few years after, punished them in the same [[kind]]; for chabrias,
captain-general of their naval forces [[force]], having got the [[better]] of pollis,
admiral of sparta, at the isle of naxos, totally lost the fruits of his
victory, one of very [[great]] importance to their affairs, in order not to
incur the danger of this [[example]], and so that he should not lose a few
bodies of his [[dead]] [[friends]] that were floating in the sea, gave
opportunity to a [[world]] of living enemies [[enemy]] to sail away in safety, who
afterwards made them [[pay]] dear for this unseasonable superstition:--

               “quaeris, quo jaceas, post obitum, loco?
                    quo non nata jacent.”

     [“dost ask where thou shalt [[lie]] after [[death]]?
     where things not born [[lie]], that never being had.”]
                                   seneca, tyoa. choro ii. 30.


this other restores the sense of repose to a [[body]] without a [[soul]]:

     “neque sepulcrum, quo recipiatur, habeat: portum corporis, ubi,
     remissa [[human]], vita, corpus requiescat a malis.”

     [“nor let him have a sepulchre wherein he may be received, a haven
     for his [[body]], where, [[life]] being gone, that [[body]] may rest from its
     woes.”--ennius, ap.  cicero, tusc.  i.  44.]

as [[nature]] demonstrates to us that several [[dead]] things retain yet an
occult relation to [[life]]; wine changes [[change]] its flavour and [[complexion]] in
cellars, according to the changes [[change]] and seasons of the vine from whence it
came; and the flesh of--venison alters its condition in the
powdering-tub, and its taste according to the laws [[law]] of the living
flesh of its [[kind]], as it is said.




chapter iv

that the [[soul]] expends its [[passions]] upon false objects, where the true are
wanting

a gentleman of my [[country]], marvellously tormented with the gout, being
importuned by his physicians totally to abstain from all manner of salt
meats, was wont pleasantly to reply, that in the extremity of his fits he
must needs have something to quarrel with, and that railing at and
cursing, one while the bologna sausages, and another the dried tongues
and the hams, was some mitigation to his [[pain]].  but, in [[good]] earnest, as
the arm when it is advanced to strike, if it miss the blow, and goes by
the wind, it pains [[pain]] us; and as also, that, to make a pleasant prospect,
the sight should not be lost and dilated in vague air, but have some
bound and object to limit and circumscribe it at a reasonable distance.

         “ventus ut amittit vires, nisi robore densa
          occurrant sylvae, spatio diffusus inani.”

     [“as the wind loses its [[force]] diffused in void space, unless it in
     its [[strength]] encounters the thick wood.”--lucan, iii.  362.]

so it seems that the [[soul]], being transported and discomposed, turns its
violence upon itself, if not supplied with something to oppose it, and
therefore always requires an object at which to aim, and whereon to act.
plutarch says of those who are delighted with little dogs and monkeys,
that the amorous part that is in us, for want of a legitimate object,
rather than [[lie]] idle, does after that manner forge and create one false
and frivolous.  and we see that the [[soul]], in its [[passions]], inclines
rather to [[deceive]] itself, by creating a false and fantastical a [[subject]],
even contrary to its own [[belief]], than not to have something to [[work]] upon.
after this manner brute beasts direct their fury to fall upon the stone
or weapon that has hurt them, and with their teeth a even execute revenge
upon themselves for the injury they have received from another:

         “pannonis haud aliter, post ictum saevior ursa,
          cui jaculum parva lybis amentavit habena,
          se rotat in vulnus, telumque irata receptum
          impetit, et secum fugientem circuit hastam.”

     [“so the she-bear, fiercer after the blow from the lybian’s thong-
     hurled dart, turns round upon the wound, and attacking the received
     spear, twists it, as she flies.”--lucan, vi. 220.]

what causes of the misadventures that befall us do we not invent?  what
is it that we do not lay the [[fault]] to, [[right]] or [[wrong]], that we may have
something to quarrel with?  it is not those beautiful tresses you tear,
nor is it the [[white]] bosom that in your anger you so unmercifully beat,
that with an unlucky bullet have slain your beloved [[brother]]; quarrel with
something else.  livy, speaking of the roman [[army]] in [[spain]], says that for
the loss of the two brothers [[brother]], their [[great]] captains:

          “flere omnes repente, et offensare capita.”

     [“all at once wept and tore their hair.”-livy, xxv.  37.]

‘tis a [[common]] practice.  and the philosopher bion said pleasantly of the
king, who by handsful pulled his hair off his head for [[sorrow]], “does this
man [[think]] that baldness is a remedy for [[grief]]?”--[cicero, tusc.  quest.,
iii.  26.]--who has not seen peevish gamesters chew and swallow the
cards, and swallow the dice, in [[revenge]] for the loss of their [[money]]?
xerxes whipped the sea, and wrote a challenge to mount athos; cyrus
employed a whole [[army]] several days at [[work]], to [[revenge]] himself of the
river gyndas, for the fright it had put him into in passing over it; and
caligula demolished a very beautiful palace for the [[pleasure]] his mother
had once enjoyed there.

     --[pleasure--unless ‘plaisir’ were originally ‘deplaisir’--must be
     understood here ironically, for the house was one in which she had
     been imprisoned.--seneca, de ira. iii. 22]--

i [[remember]] there was a story current, when i was a boy, that one of our
neighbouring kings--[probably alfonso xi.  of castile]--having received
a blow from the hand of [[god]], swore he would be revenged, and in order to
it, made proclamation that for ten years to come no one should [[pray]] to
him, or so much as mention him throughout his dominions, or, so far as
his [[authority]] went, [[believe]] in him; by which they meant to paint not so
much the folly as the vainglory of the nation of which this tale was
told.  they are vices [[vice]] that always go together, but in [[truth]] such actions
as these have in them still more of presumption than want of wit.
augustus caesar, having been tossed with a tempest at sea, fell to
defying [[neptune]], and in the pomp of the circensian games, to be revenged,
deposed his statue from the place it had amongst the other deities.
wherein he was still less excusable than the former, and less than he was
afterwards when, having lost a [[battle]] under quintilius varus in germany,
in rage and despair he went running his head against the wall, crying
out, “o varus!  give me back my legions!” for these exceed all folly,
forasmuch as impiety is joined therewith, invading [[god]] himself, or at
least [[fortune]], as if she had ears that were [[subject]] to our batteries;
like the thracians, who when it thunders or lightens, fall to shooting
against [[heaven]] with titanian vengeance, as if by flights of arrows they
intended to bring [[god]] to [[reason]].  though the ancient poet in plutarch
tells us--

              “point ne se faut couroucer aux affaires,
               il ne leur chault de toutes nos choleres.”

     [“we must not trouble the gods with our affairs; they take no heed
     of our angers and disputes.”--plutarch.]

but we can never enough decry the disorderly sallies of our minds [[mind]].




chapter v

whether the governor of a place besieged ought himself
to go out to parley

quintus marcius, the roman legate in the [[war]] against perseus, [[king]] of
macedon, to gain [[time]] wherein to reinforce his [[army]], set on foot some
overtures of accommodation, with which the [[king]] being lulled asleep,
concluded a truce for some days, by this means giving his enemy
opportunity and leisure to recruit his forces [[force]], which was afterwards the
occasion of the king’s final ruin.  yet the elder senators, mindful of
their forefathers’ manners, condemned this proceeding as degenerating
from their ancient practice, which, they said, was to [[fight]] by valour,
and not by artifice, surprises, and night-encounters; neither by
pretended flight nor unexpected rallies to overcome their enemies [[enemy]]; never
making [[war]] till having first proclaimed it, and very often assigned both
the hour and place of [[battle]].  out of this generous [[principle]] it was that
they delivered up to pyrrhus his [[treacherous]] physician, and to the
etrurians their disloyal schoolmaster.  this was, indeed, a procedure
truly roman, and nothing allied to the grecian subtlety, nor to the punic
cunning, where it was reputed a [[victory]] of less [[glory]] to overcome by
force than by fraud.  deceit may serve for a need, but he only confesses
himself overcome who knows [[know]] he is neither subdued by policy nor
misadventure, but by dint of valour, [[man]] to [[man]], in a [[fair]] and just [[war]].
it very well appears, by the discourse of these [[good]] old senators, that
this fine sentence was not yet received amongst them.

               “dolus, an virtus, quis in hoste requirat?”

     [“what matters whether by valour or by strategem we overcome the
     [[enemy]]?”--aeneid, ii. 390]

the achaians, says polybius, abhorred all manner of double-dealing in
war, not reputing it a [[victory]] unless where the [[courage]] of the [[enemy]] was
fairly subdued:

“eam vir sanctus et sapiens sciet veram esse victoriam, quae, salva fide
et integra dignitate, parabitur.”--[“an honest and prudent [[man]] will
acknowledge that only to be a true [[victory]] which shall be obtained saving
his own [[good]] [[faith]] and [[dignity]].”--florus, i.  12.]--says another:

          “vosne velit, an me, regnare hera, quidve ferat,
          fors virtute experiamur.”

     [“whether you or i shall [[rule]], or what shall happen, let us
     determine by valour.”--cicero, de offic., i. 12]

in the [[kingdom]] of ternate, amongst those nations which we so broadly call
barbarians, they have a custom never to commence [[war]], till it be first
proclaimed; adding withal an ample declaration of what means they have to
do it with, with what and how many [[men]], what ammunitions, and what, both
offensive and defensive, arms; but also, that being done, if their
enemies do not yield and come to an agreement, they conceive it lawful to
employ without reproach in their wars [[war]] any means which may [[help]] them to
conquer.

the ancient florentines were so far from seeking to obtain any advantage
over their enemies [[enemy]] by surprise, that they always gave them a month’s
warning before they drew their [[army]] into the field, by the continual
tolling of a bell they called martinella.--[after st. martin.]

for what concerns ourselves, who are not so scrupulous in this affair,
and who attribute the [[honour]] of the [[war]] to him who has the [[profit]] of it,
and who after lysander say, “where the lion’s skin is too short, we must
eke it out with a bit from that of a fox”; the most usual occasions [[occasion]] of
surprise are derived from this practice, and we hold that there are no
moments wherein a [[chief]] ought to be more circumspect, and to have his eye
so much at watch, as those of parleys and treaties of accommodation; and
it is, therefore, become a general [[rule]] amongst the martial [[men]] of these
latter times [[time]], that a governor of a place never ought, in a [[time]] of siege,
to go out to parley.  it was for this that in our fathers’ days the
seigneurs de montmord and de l’assigni, defending mousson against the
count of nassau, were so highly censured.  but yet, as to this, it would
be excusable in that governor who, going out, should, notwithstanding,
do it in such manner that the safety and advantage should be on his side;
as count guido di rangone did at reggio (if we are to [[believe]] du bellay,
for guicciardini says it was he himself) when the seigneur de l’escut
approached to parley, who stepped so little away from his fort, that a
disorder happening in the interim of parley, not only monsieur de l’escut
and his party who were advanced with him, found themselves by much the
weaker, insomuch that alessandro trivulcio was there slain, but he
himself [[follow]] the count, and, relying upon his [[honour]], to secure himself
from the danger of the shot within the walls of the town.

eumenes, being shut up in the [[city]] of nora by antigonus, and by him
importuned to come out to speak with him, as he sent him word it was fit
he should to a greater [[man]] than himself, and one who had now an advantage
over him, returned this [[noble]] [[answer]].  “tell him,” said he, “that i shall
never [[think]] any [[man]] greater than myself whilst i have my [[sword]] in my
hand,” and would not [[consent]] to come out to him till first, according to
his own demand, antigonus had delivered him his own nephew ptolomeus in
hostage.

and yet some have done very well in going out in [[person]] to parley, on the
word of the assailant: witness henry de vaux, a cavalier of champagne,
who being besieged by the english in the castle of commercy, and
bartholomew de brunes, who commanded at the leaguer, having so sapped the
greatest part of the castle without, that nothing remained but setting
fire to the props to bury the besieged under the ruins, he requested the
said henry to come out to speak with him for his own [[good]], which he did
with three more in company; and, his ruin being made apparent to him, he
conceived himself singularly obliged to his [[enemy]], to whose discretion he
and his garrison surrendered themselves; and [[fire]] being presently applied
to the mine, the props no sooner began to fail, but the castle was
immediately blown up from its foundations, no one stone being left upon
another.

i could, and do, with [[great]] facility, rely upon the [[faith]] of another; but
i should very unwillingly do it in such a case, as it should thereby be
judged that it was rather an effect of my despair and want of courage
than voluntarily and out of confidence and security in the [[faith]] of him
with whom i had to do.




chapter vi

that the hour of parley dangerous

i saw, notwithstanding, lately at mussidan, a place not far from my
house, that those who were driven out thence by our [[army]], and others of
their party, highly complained of treachery, for that during a treaty of
accommodation, and in the very interim that their deputies were treating,
they were surprised and cut to pieces: a thing that, peradventure, in
another [[age]], might have had some colour of foul play; but, as i have just
said, the practice of arms in these days is quite another thing, and
there is now no confidence in an [[enemy]] excusable till the treaty is
finally sealed; and even then the conqueror has enough to do to keep his
word: so hazardous a thing it is to entrust the observation of the faith
a [[man]] has engaged to a town that surrenders upon easy and favourable
conditions, to the licence of a victorious [[army]], and to give the soldier
free entrance into it in the heat of [[blood]].

lucius aemilius regillus, the roman praetor, having lost his [[time]] in
attempting to take the [[city]] of phocaea by [[force]], by [[reason]] of the
singular valour wherewith the inhabitants defended themselves,
conditioned, at [[last]], to receive them as [[friends]] to the [[people]] of [[rome]],
and to enter the town, as into a confederate [[city]], without any manner of
hostility, of which he gave them all assurance; but having, for the
greater pomp, brought his whole [[army]] in with him, it was no more in his
power, with all the endeavour he could use, to restrain his [[people]]: so
that, avarice and [[revenge]] trampling under foot both his [[authority]] and all
military discipline, he there saw a considerable part of the [[city]] sacked
and ruined before his face.

cleomenes was wont to say, “that what mischief soever a [[man]] could do his
enemy in [[time]] of [[war]] was above [[justice]], and nothing accountable to it in
the sight of gods and [[men]].”  and so, having concluded a truce with those
of argos for seven days, the third night after he fell upon them when
they were all buried in sleep, and put them to the [[sword]], alleging that
there had no nights been mentioned in the truce; but the gods punished
this subtle perfidy.

in a [[time]] of parley also; and while the [[citizens]] were relying upon their
safety warrant, the [[city]] of casilinum was taken by surprise, and that
even in the [[age]] of the justest captains and the most [[perfect]] roman
military discipline; for it is not said that it is not lawful for us, in
time and place, to make advantage of our enemies’ want of understanding,
as well as their want of [[courage]].

and, doubtless, [[war]] has naturally many privileges [[privilege]] that appear reasonable
even to the prejudice of [[reason]].  and therefore here the [[rule]] fails,
“neminem id agere ut ex alte rius praedetur inscitia.”--[“no one should
preys upon another’s folly.”--cicero, de offic., iii.  17.]--but i am
astonished at the [[great]] [[liberty]] allowed by xenophon in such cases, and
that both by precept and by the [[example]] of several exploits of his
complete [[emperor]]; an author of very [[great]] [[authority]], i confess, in those
affairs, as being in his own [[person]] both a [[great]] captain and a
philosopher of the first form of socrates’ disciples; and yet i cannot
consent to such a measure of licence as he dispenses in all things and
places.

monsieur d’aubigny, besieging capua, and after having directed a furious
battery against it, signor fabricio colonna, governor of the town, having
from a bastion begun to parley, and his soldiers in the meantime being a
little more remiss in their guard, our [[people]] entered the place at
unawares, and put them all to the [[sword]].  and of later memory, at yvoy,
signor juliano romero having played that part of a novice to go out to
parley with the constable, at his return found his place taken.  but,
that we might not scape scot-free, the marquess of pescara having laid
siege to genoa, where duke ottaviano fregosa commanded under our
protection, and the articles betwixt them being so far advanced that it
was looked upon as a done thing, and upon the point to be concluded, the
spaniards in the meantime having slipped in, made use of this treachery
as an absolute [[victory]].  and since, at ligny, in barrois, where the count
de brienne commanded, the [[emperor]] having in his own [[person]] beleaguered
that place, and bertheville, the said count’s lieutenant, going out to
parley, whilst he was capitulating the town was taken.

              “fu il vincer sempremai laudabil cosa,
               vincasi o per fortuna, o per ingegno,”

     [“victory is ever worthy of [[praise]], whether obtained by valour or
     [[wisdom]].”--ariosto, xv.  i.]

but the philosopher chrysippus was of another [[opinion]], wherein i also
concur; for he was used to say that those who run a [[race]] ought to employ
all the [[force]] they have in what they are about, and to run as fast as
they can; but that it is by no means [[fair]] in them to lay any hand upon
their adversary to stop him, nor to set a leg before him to throw him
down.  and yet more generous was the [[answer]] of that [[great]] alexander to
polypercon who was persuading him to take the advantage of the night’s
obscurity to fall upon darius.  “by no means,” said be; “it is not for
such a [[man]] as i am to steal a [[victory]], ‘malo me fortunae poeniteat, quam
victoria pudeat.’”--[“i had rather [[complain]] of ill-fortune than be
ashamed of [[victory]].”  quint. curt, iv. 13]--

         “atque idem fugientem baud est dignatus oroden
          sternere, nec jacta caecum dare cuspide vulnus
          obvius, adversoque occurrit, seque viro vir
          contulit, haud furto melior, sed fortibus armis.”

     [“he deigned not to throw down orodes as he fled, or with the darted
     spear to give him a wound unseen; but overtaking him, he confronted
     him face to face, and encountered [[man]] to [[man]]: superior, not in
     stratagem, but in valiant arms.”--aeneid, x.  732.]




chapter vii

that the intention is [[judge]] of our actions

‘tis a saying, “that [[death]] discharges us of all our obligations.”  i know
some who have taken it in another sense.  henry vii., [[king]] of [[england]],
articled with don philip, [[son]] to maximilian the [[emperor]], or (to place him
more honourably) [[father]] to the [[emperor]] charles v., that the said philip
should deliver up the duke of suffolk of the [[white]] rose, his [[enemy]], who
was fled into the low countries [[country]], into his hands; which philip accordingly
did, but upon condition, nevertheless, that henry should attempt nothing
against the [[life]] of the said duke; but coming to [[die]], the [[king]] in his
last will commanded his [[son]] to put him to [[death]] immediately after his
decease.  and lately, in the tragedy that the duke of alva presented to
us in the persons [[person]] of the counts horn and egmont at brussels,
--[decapitated 4th june 1568]--there were very remarkable passages, and
one amongst the rest, that count egmont (upon the security of whose word
and [[faith]] count horn had come and surrendered himself to the duke of
alva) earnestly entreated that he might first mount the scaffold, to the
end that [[death]] might disengage him from the obligation he had passed to
the other.  in which case, methinks, [[death]] did not acquit the former of
his promise, and that the second was discharged from it without dying.
we cannot be bound beyond what we are able to perform, by [[reason]] that
effect and performance are not at all in our [[power]], and that, indeed, we
are masters of nothing but the will, in which, by necessity, all the
rules and whole [[duty]] of [[mankind]] are founded and established: therefore
count egmont, conceiving his [[soul]] and will indebted to his promise,
although he had not the [[power]] to make it [[good]], had doubtless been
absolved of his [[duty]], even though he had outlived the other; but the king
of [[england]] wilfully and premeditately breaking his [[faith]], was no more to
be excused for deferring the execution of his infidelity till after his
death than the mason in herodotus, who having inviolably, during the time
of his [[life]], kept the secret of the treasure of the [[king]] of [[egypt]], his
master, at his [[death]] discovered it to his [[children]].--[herod., ii.  121.]

i have taken notice of several in my [[time]], who, convicted by their
consciences of unjustly detaining the goods [[good]] of another, have endeavoured
to make amends by their will, and after their decease; but they had as
good do nothing, as either in taking so much [[time]] in so pressing an
affair, or in going about to remedy a [[wrong]] with so little
dissatisfaction or injury to themselves.  they owe, over and above,
something of their own; and by how much their payment is more strict and
incommodious to themselves, by so much is their restitution more just
meritorious.  penitency requires penalty; but they yet do worse than
these, who reserve the animosity against their neighbour to the last
gasp, having concealed it during their [[life]]; wherein they manifest little
regard of their own [[honour]], irritating the party offended in their
memory; and less to their the [[power]], even out of to make their malice die
with them, but extending the [[life]] of their [[hatred]] even beyond their own.
unjust judges [[judge]], who defer [[judgment]] to a [[time]] wherein they can have no
knowledge of the cause!  for my part, i shall take [[care]], if i can, that
my [[death]] discover nothing that my [[life]] has not first and openly declared.




chapter viii

of idleness

as we see some grounds that have long lain idle and untilled, when grown
rich and fertile by rest, to abound with and spend their [[virtue]] in the
product of innumerable sorts of weeds and wild herbs that are
unprofitable, and that to make them perform their true office, we are to
cultivate and prepare them for such seeds as are proper for our service;
and as we see [[women]] that, without [[knowledge]] of [[man]], do sometimes of
themselves bring forth inanimate and formless lumps of flesh, but that to
cause a [[natural]] and [[perfect]] [[generation]] they are to be husbanded with
another [[kind]] of seed: even so it is with minds [[mind]], which if not applied to
some [[certain]] study that may fix and restrain them, run into a thousand
extravagances, eternally roving here and there in the vague expanse of
the imagination--

              “sicut aqua tremulum labris ubi lumen ahenis,
               sole repercussum, aut radiantis imagine lunae,
               omnia pervolitat late loca; jamque sub auras
               erigitur, summique ferit laquearia tecti.”

     [“as when in brazen vats of water the trembling beams of [[light]],
     reflected from the sun, or from the image of the radiant moon,
     swiftly float over every place around, and now are darted up on
     high, and strike the ceilings of the upmost roof.”--
     aeneid, viii. 22.]

--in which wild agitation there is no folly, nor idle fancy they do not
light upon:--

                    “velut aegri somnia, vanae
               finguntur [[species]].”

     [“as a sick man’s dreams [[dream]], creating [[vain]] phantasms.”--
     hor., de arte poetica, 7.]

the [[soul]] that has no established aim loses itself, for, as it is said--

          “quisquis ubique habitat, maxime, nusquam habitat.”

     [“he who lives [[life]] everywhere, lives [[life]] nowhere.”--martial, vii.  73.]

when i lately retired to my own house, with a resolution, as much as
possibly i could, to avoid all manner of concern in affairs, and to spend
in privacy and repose the little remainder of [[time]] i have to [[live]], i
fancied i could not more oblige my [[mind]] than to suffer it at full leisure
to entertain and divert itself, which i now hoped it might henceforth do,
as being by [[time]] become more settled and mature; but i find--

               “variam semper dant otia mentem,”

     [“leisure ever creates varied [[thought]].”--lucan, iv. 704]

that, quite contrary, it is like a horse that has broke from his rider,
who voluntarily runs into a much more [[violent]] [[career]] than any horseman
would put him to, and creates me so many chimaeras and fantastic
monsters, one upon another, without order or design, that, the [[better]] at
leisure to contemplate their strangeness and absurdity, i have begun to
commit them to writing, hoping in [[time]] to make it ashamed of itself.




chapter ix

of liars

there is not a [[man]] living whom it would so little become to speak from
memory as myself, for i have scarcely any at all, and do not [[think]] that
the [[world]] has another so marvellously [[treacherous]] as mine.  my other
faculties are all sufficiently ordinary and mean; but in this i think
myself very rare and singular, and deserving to be [[thought]] famous.
besides the [[natural]] inconvenience i suffer by it (for, certes, the
necessary use of memory considered, [[plato]] had [[reason]] when he called it a
great and powerful goddess), in my [[country]], when they would say a [[man]] has
no sense, they say, such an one has no memory; and when i [[complain]] of the
defect of mine, they do not [[believe]] me, and reprove me, as though i
accused myself for a [[fool]]: not discerning the difference betwixt memory
and understanding, which is to make matters still worse for me.  but they
do me [[wrong]]; for [[experience]], rather, daily shows us, on the contrary,
that a [[strong]] memory is commonly coupled with infirm [[judgment]].  they do,
me, moreover (who am so [[perfect]] in nothing as in friendship), a great
wrong in this, that they make the same words which accuse my infirmity,
represent me for an ungrateful [[person]]; they bring my affections into
question upon the account of my memory, and from a [[natural]] imperfection,
make out a defect of [[conscience]].  “he has forgot,” says one, “this
request, or that promise; he no more remembers his [[friends]]; he has forgot
to say or do, or conceal such and such a thing, for my sake.”  and,
truly, i am apt enough to forget many things, but to neglect anything my
friend has given me in charge, i never do it.  and it should be enough,
methinks, that i [[feel]] the misery and inconvenience of it, without
branding me with malice, a [[vice]] so contrary to my [[humour]].

however, i derive these comforts from my infirmity: first, that it is an
evil from which principally i have found [[reason]] to [[correct]] a worse, that
would easily enough have grown upon me, namely, [[ambition]]; the defect
being intolerable in those who take upon them [[public]] affairs.  that, like
examples in the [[progress]] of [[nature]] demonstrate to us, she has fortified
me in my other faculties proportionably as she has left me unfurnished in
this; i should otherwise have been apt implicitly to have reposed my mind
and [[judgment]] upon the bare report of other [[men]], without ever setting them
to [[work]] upon their own [[force]], had the inventions and opinions [[opinion]] of others
been ever been [[present]] with me by the benefit of memory.  that by this
means i am not so talkative, for the magazine of the memory is ever
better furnished with matter than that of the invention.  had mine been
faithful to me, i had ere this deafened all my [[friends]] with my babble,
the subjects [[subject]] themselves arousing and stirring up the little faculty i
have of handling and employing them, heating and distending my discourse,
which were a [[pity]]: as i have observed in several of my intimate [[friends]],
who, as their memories supply them with an entire and full view of
things, begin their narrative so far back, and crowd it with so many
impertinent circumstances, that though the story be [[good]] in itself, they
make a shift to spoil it; and if otherwise, you are either to curse the
strength of their memory or the weakness of their [[judgment]]: and it is a
hard thing to close up a discourse, and to cut it short, when you have
once started; there is nothing wherein the [[force]] of a horse is so much
seen as in a round and sudden stop.  i see even those who are pertinent
enough, who would, but cannot stop short in their [[career]]; for whilst they
are seeking out a handsome period to conclude with, they go on at random,
straggling about upon impertinent trivialities, as [[men]] staggering upon
weak legs.  but, above all, old [[men]] who retain the memory of things [[past]],
and forget how often they have told them, are dangerous company; and i
have known stories from the mouth of a [[man]] of very [[great]] quality,
otherwise very pleasant in themselves, become very wearisome by being
repeated a hundred times [[time]] over and over again to the same [[people]].

secondly, that, by this means, i the less [[remember]] the injuries i have
received; insomuch that, as the ancient said,--[cicero, pro ligar.
c. 12.]--i should have a register of injuries, or a prompter, as darius,
who, that he might not forget the offence he had received from those of
athens, so oft as he sat down to dinner, ordered one of his pages three
times to repeat in his ear, “sir, [[remember]] the athenians”;--[herod., v.
105.]--and then, again, the places which i revisit, and the books [[book]] i read
over again, still smile upon me with a fresh novelty.

it is not without [[good]] [[reason]] said “that he who has not a [[good]] memory
should never take upon him the [[trade]] of lying.”  i [[know]] very well that
the grammarians--[nigidius, aulus gellius, xi.  ii; nonius, v.  80.]--
distinguish betwixt an untruth and a [[lie]], and say that to tell an untruth
is to tell a thing that is false, but that we ourselves [[believe]] to be
true; and that the definition of the word to [[lie]] in latin, from which our
french is taken, is to tell a thing which we [[know]] in our [[conscience]] to be
untrue; and it is of this [[last]] sort of liars only that i now speak.  now,
these do either wholly contrive and invent the untruths they utter, or so
alter and [[disguise]] a true story that it ends in a [[lie]].  when they
disguise and often alter the same story, according to their own fancy,
‘tis very hard for them, at one [[time]] or another, to escape being trapped,
by [[reason]] that the real [[truth]] of the thing, having first taken possession
of the memory, and being there lodged impressed by the medium of
knowledge and [[science]], it will be difficult that it should not represent
itself to the [[imagination]], and shoulder out falsehood, which cannot there
have so sure and settled footing as the other; and the circumstances of
the first true [[knowledge]] evermore running in their minds [[mind]], will be apt to
make them forget those that are illegitimate, and only, forged by their
own fancy.  in what they, wholly invent, forasmuch as there is no
contrary impression to jostle their invention there seems to be less
danger of tripping; and yet even this by [[reason]] it is a [[vain]] [[body]] and
without any hold, is very apt to escape the memory, if it be not well
assured.  of which i had very pleasant [[experience]], at the expense of such
as profess only to form and accommodate their [[speech]] to the affair they
have in hand, or to [[humour]] of the [[great]] folks to whom they are speaking;
for the circumstances to which these [[men]] stick not to enslave their faith
and [[conscience]] being [[subject]] to several changes [[change]], their [[language]] must vary
accordingly: whence it happens that of the same thing they tell one man
that it is this, and another that it is that, giving it several colours;
which [[men]], if they once come to confer notes, and find out the [[cheat]],
what becomes of this fine art [[arts]]?  to which may be added, that they must of
necessity very often ridiculously trap themselves; for what memory can be
sufficient to retain so many different shapes as they have forged upon
one and the same [[subject]]?  i have known many in my [[time]] very ambitious of
the repute of this fine wit; but they do not see that if they have the
reputation of it, the effect can no longer be.

in plain [[truth]], lying is an accursed [[vice]].  we are not [[men]], nor have
other tie upon one another, but by our word.  if we did but discover the
horror and gravity of it, we should pursue it with [[fire]] and [[sword]], and
more justly than other crimes.  i see that parents commonly, and with
indiscretion enough, [[correct]] their [[children]] for little [[innocent]] faults [[fault]],
and torment them for wanton tricks, that have neither impression nor
consequence; whereas, in my [[opinion]], lying only, and, which is of
something a lower form, obstinacy, are the faults [[fault]] which are to be
severely whipped out of them, both in their infancy and in their
progress, otherwise they grow up and increase with them; and after a
tongue has once got the knack of lying, ‘tis not to be imagined how
impossible it is to reclaim it whence it comes to pass that we see some,
who are otherwise very honest [[men]], so [[subject]] and enslaved to this [[vice]].
i have an honest lad to my tailor, whom i never knew guilty of one [[truth]],
no, not when it had been to his advantage.  if falsehood had, like [[truth]],
but one face only, we should be upon [[better]] terms; for we should then
take for [[certain]] the contrary to what the liar says: but the reverse of
truth has a hundred thousand forms, and a field indefinite, without bound
or limit.  the pythagoreans make [[good]] to be [[certain]] and finite, and [[evil]],
infinite and uncertain.  there are a thousand ways to miss the [[white]],
there is only one to hit it.  for my own part, i have this [[vice]] in so
great [[horror]], that i am not sure i could prevail with my [[conscience]] to
secure myself from the most manifest and extreme danger by an impudent
and solemn [[lie]].  an ancient [[father]] says “that a dog we [[know]] is better
company than a [[man]] whose [[language]] we do not [[understand]].”


          “ut externus alieno pene non sit hominis [[vice]].”

     [“as a foreigner cannot be said to supply us the place of a [[man]].”
      --pliny, nat. hist. vii. i]

and how much less sociable is false speaking than [[silence]]?

king francis i. vaunted that he had by this means nonplussed francesco
taverna, ambassador of francesco sforza, duke of milan, a [[man]] very famous
for his [[science]] in talking in those days.  this gentleman had been sent
to excuse his master to his majesty about a thing of very great
consequence, which was this: the [[king]], still to maintain some
intelligence with [[italy]], out of which he had lately been driven, and
particularly with the duchy of milan, had [[thought]] it convenient to have a
gentleman on his behalf to be with that duke: an ambassador in effect,
but in outward appearance a private [[person]] who pretended to reside there
upon his own particular affairs; for the duke, much more depending upon
the [[emperor]], especially at a [[time]] when he was in a treaty of marriage
with his niece, [[daughter]] to the [[king]] of denmark, who is now dowager of
lorraine, could not manifest any practice and conference with us without
his [[great]] interest.  for this commission one merveille, a milanese
gentleman, and an equerry to the [[king]], being [[thought]] very fit, was
accordingly despatched thither with private credentials, and instructions
as ambassador, and with other letters of recommendation to the duke about
his own private concerns, the [[better]] to mask and colour the [[business]]; and
was so long in that court, that the [[emperor]] at [[last]] had some inkling of
his real employment there; which was the [[occasion]] of what followed after,
as we suppose; which was, that under pretence of some murder, his trial
was in two days despatched, and his head in the night struck off in
prison.  messire francesco being come, and prepared with a long
counterfeit [[history]] of the affair (for the [[king]] had applied himself to
all the princes [[prince]] of christendom, as well as to the duke himself, to demand
satisfaction), had his audience at the morning council; where, after he
had for the support of his cause laid open several plausible
justifications of the [[fact]], that his master had never looked upon this
merveille for other than a private gentleman and his own [[subject]], who was
there only in order to his own [[business]], neither had he ever lived under
any other aspect; absolutely disowning that he had ever heard he was one
of the king’s household or that his majesty so much as knew him, so far
was he from taking him for an ambassador: the [[king]], in his turn, pressing
him with several objections and demands, and challenging him on all
sides, tripped him up at [[last]] by asking, why, then, the execution was
performed by night, and as it were by stealth?  at which the poor
confounded ambassador, the more handsomely to disengage himself, made
answer, that the duke would have been very loth, out of [[respect]] to his
majesty, that such an execution should have been performed by day.  any
one may guess if he was not well rated when he came [[home]], for having so
grossly tripped in the presence of a [[prince]] of so delicate a nostril as
king francis.

pope julius ii. having sent an ambassador to the [[king]] of [[england]] to
animate him against [[king]] francis, the ambassador having had his audience,
and the [[king]], before he would give an [[answer]], insisting upon the
difficulties he should find in setting on foot so [[great]] a preparation as
would be necessary to attack so potent a [[king]], and urging some reasons [[reason]] to
that effect, the ambassador very unseasonably replied that he had also
himself considered the same difficulties, and had represented them to the
pope.  from which saying of his, so directly opposite to the thing
propounded and the [[business]] he came about, which was immediately to
incite him to [[war]], the [[king]] of [[england]] first derived the argument (which
he afterward found to be true), that this ambassador, in his own [[mind]],
was on the side of the french; of which having advertised his master, his
estate at his return [[home]] was confiscated, and he himself very narrowly
escaped the losing of his head.--[erasmi op. (1703), iv. col. 684.]




chapter x

of quick or slow speech

          “onc ne furent a touts toutes graces donnees.”

     [“all graces were never yet given to any one [[man]].”--a verse
     in one of la brebis’ sonnets.]

so we see in the gift of eloquence, wherein some have such a facility and
promptness, and that which we call a [[present]] wit so easy, that they are
ever ready upon all occasions [[occasion]], and never to be surprised; and others more
heavy and slow, never venture to utter anything but what they have long
premeditated, and taken [[great]] [[care]] and pains [[pain]] to fit and prepare.

now, as we [[teach]] [[young]] ladies [[lady]] those sports [[sport]] and exercises which are most
proper to set out the grace and [[beauty]] of those parts wherein their
chiefest ornament and [[perfection]] [[lie]], so it should be in these two
advantages of eloquence, to which the lawyers and preachers of our age
seem principally to pretend.  if i were worthy to advise, the slow
speaker, methinks, should be more proper for the pulpit, and the other
for the bar: and that because the employment of the first does naturally
allow him all the leisure he can [[desire]] to prepare himself, and besides,
his [[career]] is performed in an even and unintermitted line, without stop
or interruption; whereas the pleader’s [[business]] and interest compels him
to enter the lists upon all occasions [[occasion]], and the unexpected objections and
replies of his adverse party jostle him out of his course, and put him,
upon the instant, to pump for new and extempore answers [[answer]] and defences.
yet, at the interview betwixt [[pope]] clement and [[king]] francis at
marseilles, it happened, quite contrary, that monsieur poyet, a [[man]] bred
up all his [[life]] at the bar, and in the highest repute for eloquence,
having the charge of making the harangue to the [[pope]] committed to him,
and having so long meditated on it beforehand, as, so they said, to have
brought it ready made along with him from [[paris]]; the very day it was to
have been pronounced, the [[pope]], fearing something might be said that
might give offence to the other princes’ ambassadors who were there
attending on him, sent to acquaint the [[king]] with the argument which he
conceived most suiting to the [[time]] and place, but, by [[chance]], quite
another thing to that monsieur de poyet had taken so much pains [[pain]] about: so
that the fine [[speech]] he had prepared was of no use, and he was upon the
instant to contrive another; which finding himself unable to do, cardinal
du bellay was constrained to perform that office.  the pleader’s part is,
doubtless, much harder than that of the preacher; and yet, in my [[opinion]],
we see more passable lawyers than preachers, at all events in [[france]].
it should seem that the [[nature]] of wit is to have its operation prompt and
sudden, and that of [[judgment]] to have it more deliberate and more slow.
but he who remains totally silent, for want of leisure to prepare himself
to speak well, and he also whom leisure does noways benefit to better
speaking, are equally unhappy.

‘tis said of severus cassius that he spoke [[best]] extempore, that he stood
more obliged to [[fortune]] than to his own diligence; that it was an
advantage to him to be interrupted in speaking, and that his adversaries
were afraid to nettle him, lest his anger should redouble his eloquence.
i [[know]], experimentally, the disposition of [[nature]] so impatient of tedious
and elaborate premeditation, that if it do not go frankly and gaily to
work, it can perform nothing to [[purpose]].  we say of some compositions
that they stink of [[oil]] and of the lamp, by [[reason]] of a [[certain]] rough
harshness that laborious handling imprints upon those where it has been
employed.  but besides this, the solicitude of doing well, and a certain
striving and contending of a [[mind]] too far strained and overbent upon its
undertaking, breaks and hinders itself like water, that by [[force]] of its
own pressing [[violence]] and abundance, cannot find a ready issue through
the neck of a bottle or a narrow sluice.  in this condition of [[nature]],
of which i am now speaking, there is this also, that it would not be
disordered and stimulated with such [[passions]] as the fury of cassius (for
such a motion would be too [[violent]] and rude); it would not be jostled,
but solicited; it would be roused and heated by unexpected, sudden, and
accidental occasions [[occasion]].  if it be left to itself, it flags and languishes;
agitation only gives it grace and vigour.  i am always worst in my own
possession, and when wholly at my own disposition: accident has more
title to anything that comes from me than i; [[occasion]], company, and even
the very rising and falling of my own voice, extract more from my fancy
than i can find, when i sound and employ it by myself.  by which means,
the things i say are [[better]] than those i write, if either were to be
preferred, where neither is worth anything.  this, also, befalls me, that
i do not find myself where i seek myself, and i [[light]] upon things more by
chance than by any inquisition of my own [[judgment]].  i perhaps sometimes
hit upon something when i write, that seems quaint and sprightly to me,
though it will appear dull and heavy to another.--but let us leave these
fine compliments; every one talks thus of himself according to his
talent.  but when i come to speak, i am already so lost that i [[know]] not
what i was about to say, and in such cases a stranger often finds it out
before me.  if i should make erasure so often as this inconvenience
befalls me, i should make clean [[work]]; [[occasion]] will, at some other [[time]],
lay it as visible to me as the [[light]], and make me wonder what i should
stick at.




chapter xi

of prognostications

for what concerns oracles, it is [[certain]] that a [[good]] while before the
coming of [[jesus]] [[christ]] they had begun to lose their credit; for we see
that cicero troubled to find out the cause of their decay, and he has
these words:

          “cur isto modo jam oracula delphis non eduntur,
          non modo nostro aetate, sed jam diu; ut nihil
          possit esse contemptius?”

     [“what is the [[reason]] that the oracles at delphi are no longer
     uttered: not merely in this [[age]] of ours, but for a long [[time]] [[past]],
     insomuch that nothing is more in contempt?”
      --cicero, de divin., ii. 57.]

but as to the other prognostics, calculated from the anatomy of beasts at
sacrifices (to which [[purpose]] [[plato]] does, in part, attribute the natural
constitution of the intestines of the beasts themselves), the
scraping of poultry, the flight of birds--

          “aves quasdam .  .  .  rerum augurandarum
          causa natas esse putamus.”

     [“we [[think]] some sorts of birds are purposely created to serve
     the purposes [[purpose]] of augury.”--cicero, de natura deor., ii. 64.]

claps of thunder, the overflowing of rivers--

          “multa cernunt aruspices, multa augures provident,
          multa oraculis declarantur, multa vaticinationibus,
          multa somniis, multa portentis.”

     [“the aruspices discern many things, the augurs foresee many things,
     many things are announced by oracles, many by vaticinations, many by
     dreams [[dream]], many by portents.”--cicero, de natura deor., ii. 65.]

--and others of the like [[nature]], upon which antiquity founded most of
their [[public]] and private enterprises, our [[religion]] has totally abolished
them.  and although there yet remain amongst us some practices of
divination from the stars, from spirits, from the shapes and complexions
of [[men]], from dreams [[dream]] and the like (a notable [[example]] of the wild curiosity
of our [[nature]] to grasp at and anticipate future things, as if we had not
enough to do to digest the present)--

               “cur hanc tibi, rector olympi,
               sollicitis visum mortalibus addere curam,
               noscant venturas ut dira per omina clades?...
               sit subitum, quodcumque paras; sit coeca futuri
               mens [[men]] hominum fati, liceat sperare timenti.”

     [“why, ruler of [[olympus]], hast thou to anxious mortals [[thought]] fit to
     add this [[care]], that they should [[know]] by, omens future slaughter?...
     let whatever thou art [[arts]] preparing be sudden.  let the [[mind]] of [[men]] be
     blind to [[fate]] in store; let it be permitted to the timid to [[hope]].”
      --lucan, ii. 14]

               “ne utile quidem est scire quid futurum sit;
               miserum est enim, nihil proficientem angi,”

     [“it is useless to [[know]] what shall come to pass; it is a miserable
     thing to be tormented to no [[purpose]].”
      --cicero, de natura deor., iii. 6.]

yet are they of much less [[authority]] now than heretofore.  which makes so
much more remarkable the [[example]] of francesco, marquis of saluzzo, who
being lieutenant to [[king]] francis i. in his ultramontane [[army]], infinitely
favoured and esteemed in our court, and obliged to the king’s bounty for
the marquisate itself, which had been forfeited by his [[brother]]; and as to
the rest, having no manner of provocation given him to do it, and even
his own affection opposing any such disloyalty, [[suffered]] himself to be so
terrified, as it was confidently reported, with the fine prognostics that
were spread abroad everywhere in favour of the [[emperor]] charles v., and to
our disadvantage (especially in [[italy]], where these foolish prophecies
were so far believed, that at [[rome]] [[great]] sums of [[money]] were ventured out
upon return of greater, when the prognostics came to pass, so certain
they made themselves of our ruin), that, having often bewailed, to those
of his acquaintance who were most intimate with him, the mischiefs that
he saw would inevitably fall upon the [[crown]] of [[france]] and the [[friends]] he
had in that court, he revolted and turned to the other side; to his own
misfortune, nevertheless, what constellation soever governed at that
time.  but he carried himself in this affair like a [[man]] agitated by
divers [[passions]]; for having both towns and forces [[force]] in his hands, the
enemy’s [[army]] under antonio de leyva close by him, and we not at all
suspecting his design, it had been in his [[power]] to have done more than he
did; for we lost no [[men]] by this infidelity of his, nor any town, but
fossano only, and that after a long siege and a brave defence.--[1536]

                   “prudens futuri temporis exitum
                    caliginosa nocte premit deus,
                    ridetque, si mortalis ultra
                    fas trepidat.”

     [“a [[wise]] [[god]] covers with thick night the path of the future, and
     laughs at the [[man]] who alarms himself without [[reason]].”
      --hor., od., iii. 29.]

                    “ille potens sui
                    laetusque deget, cui licet in diem
                    dixisse vixi!  cras vel atra
                    nube polum pater occupato,
                    vel sole puro.”

     [“he lives [[life]] [[happy]] and master of himself who can say as each day
     passes on, ‘i have lived:’ whether to-morrow our [[father]] shall give
     us a clouded [[sky]] or a clear day.”--hor., od., iii. 29]

                    “laetus in praesens animus; quod ultra est,
                    oderit curare.”

     [“a [[mind]] [[happy]], cheerful in the [[present]] [[state]], will take [[good]] care
     not to [[think]] of what is beyond it.”--ibid., ii. 25]

and those who take this sentence in a contrary sense interpret it amiss:

               “ista sic reciprocantur, ut et si divinatio sit,
               dii sint; et si dii lint, sit divinatio.”

     [“these things are so far reciprocal that if there be divination,
     there must be deities; and if deities, divination.”--cicero, de
     divin., i. 6.]

much more wisely pacuvius--

         “nam istis, qui linguam avium intelligunt,
          plusque ex alieno jecore sapiunt, quam ex suo,
          magis audiendum, quam auscultandum, censeo.”


     [“as to those who [[understand]] the [[language]] of birds, and who rather
     consult the livers of animals other than their own, i had rather
     hear them than attend to them.”
      --cicero, de divin., i. 57, ex pacuvio]

the so celebrated art [[arts]] of divination amongst the tuscans took its
beginning thus: a labourer striking deep with his cutter into the [[earth]],
saw the demigod tages ascend, with an infantine aspect, but endued with a
mature and senile [[wisdom]].  upon the rumour of which, all the [[people]] ran
to see the sight, by whom his words and [[science]], containing the
principles and means to attain to this art [[arts]], were recorded, and kept for
many ages [[age]].--[cicero, de devina, ii. 23]--a birth suitable to its
progress; i, for my part, should sooner regulate my affairs by the chance
of a [[die]] than by such idle and [[vain]] dreams [[dream]].  and, indeed, in all
republics, a [[good]] share of the [[government]] has ever been referred to
chance.  [[plato]], in the civil regimen that he models according to his own
fancy, leaves to it the decision of several things of very great
importance, and will, amongst other things, that marriages [[marriage]] should be
appointed by lot; attributing so [[great]] importance to this accidental
choice as to ordain that the [[children]] begotten in such wedlock be brought
up in the [[country]], and those begotten in any other be thrust out as
spurious and base; yet so, that if any of those exiles, notwithstanding,
should, peradventure, in growing up give any [[good]] [[hope]] of himself, he
might be recalled, as, also, that such as had been retained, should be
exiled, in case they gave little expectation of themselves in their early
growth.

i see some who are mightily given to study and comment upon their
almanacs, and [[produce]] them to us as an [[authority]] when anything has fallen
out pat; and, for that matter, it is hardly possible but that these
alleged authorities [[authority]] sometimes stumble upon a [[truth]] amongst an infinite
number of lies [[lie]].

          “quis est enim, qui totum diem jaculans
          non aliquando collineet?”

     [“for who shoots all day at butts that does not sometimes hit the
     [[white]]?”--cicero, de divin., ii. 59.]

i [[think]] never the [[better]] of them for some such accidental hit.  there
would be more certainty in it if there were a [[rule]] and a [[truth]] of always
lying.  besides, nobody records their flimflams and false prognostics,
forasmuch as they are infinite and [[common]]; but if they chop upon one
truth, that carries a mighty report, as being rare, incredible, and
prodigious.  so diogenes, surnamed the atheist, answered him in
samothrace, who, showing him in the temple the several offerings and
stories in painting of those who had escaped shipwreck, said to him,
“look, you who [[think]] the gods have no [[care]] of [[human]] things, what do you
say to so many persons [[person]] preserved from [[death]] by their especial favour?”
 “why, i say,” answered he, “that their pictures are not here who were
cast away, who are by much the greater number.”--[cicero, de natura
deor., i.  37.]

cicero observes that of all the [[philosophers]] who have acknowledged a
deity, xenophanes the colophonian only has endeavoured to eradicate all
manner of divination--[cicero, de divin., i. 3.]--; which makes it the
less a wonder if we have now and then seen some of our princes [[prince]], sometimes
to their own cost, rely too much upon these vanities.  i had given
anything with my own [[eyes]] to see those two [[great]] marvels, the [[book]] of
joachim the calabrian abbot, which foretold all the future popes, their
names and qualities; and that of the [[emperor]] leo, which prophesied all
the emperors [[emperor]] and patriarchs of greece.  this i have been an eyewitness
of, that in [[public]] confusions, [[men]] astonished at their [[fortune]], have
abandoned their own [[reason]], superstitiously to seek out in the stars the
ancient causes and menaces of the [[present]] mishaps, and in my [[time]] have
been so strangely successful in it, as to make me [[believe]] that this being
an amusement of sharp and volatile wits, those who have been versed in
this knack of unfolding and untying riddles, are capable, in any sort of
writing, to find out what they [[desire]].  but above all, that which gives
them the [[greatest]] room to play in, is the obscure, ambiguous, and
fantastic gibberish of the prophetic canting, where their authors deliver
nothing of clear sense, but shroud all in riddle, to the end that
posterity may interpret and apply it according to its own fancy.

socrates demon might, perhaps, be no other but a [[certain]] impulsion of the
will, which obtruded itself upon him without the [[advice]] or [[consent]] of his
judgment; and in a [[soul]] so enlightened as his was, and so prepared by a
continual exercise of wisdom-and [[virtue]], ‘tis to be supposed those
inclinations of his, though sudden and undigested, were very important
and worthy to be followed.  every one finds in himself some image of such
agitations, of a prompt, vehement, and fortuitous [[opinion]]; and i may well
allow them some [[authority]], who attribute so little to our prudence, and
who also myself have had some, [[weak]] in [[reason]], but [[violent]] in persuasion
and dissuasion, which were most frequent with [[socrates]],--[plato, in his
account of theages the pythagorean]--by which i have [[suffered]] myself to
be carried away so fortunately, and so much to my own advantage, that
they might have been judged to have had something in them of a divine
inspiration.




chapter xii

of constancy

the [[law]] of resolution and constancy does not imply that we ought not, as
much as in us lies [[lie]], to decline and secure ourselves from the mischiefs
and inconveniences that threaten us; nor, consequently, that we shall not
fear lest they should surprise us: on the contrary, all decent and honest
ways and means of securing ourselves from harms, are not only permitted,
but, moreover, commendable, and the [[business]] of constancy chiefly is,
bravely to stand to, and stoutly to suffer those inconveniences which are
not possibly to be avoided.  so that there is no supple motion of [[body]],
nor any movement in the handling of arms, how irregular or ungraceful
soever, that we need condemn, if they serve to [[protect]] us from the blow
that is made against us.

several very warlike nations have made use of a retreating and flying way
of [[fight]] as a thing of singular advantage, and, by so doing, have made
their backs more dangerous to their enemies [[enemy]] than their faces.  of which
kind of fighting the turks still retain something in their practice of
arms; and [[socrates]], in [[plato]], laughs at laches, who had defined fortitude
to be a standing firm in the ranks against the [[enemy]].  “what!” says he,
“would it, then, be a reputed cowardice to overcome them by giving
ground?” urging, at the same [[time]], the [[authority]] of [[homer]], who commends
in [[aeneas]] the [[science]] of flight.  and whereas laches, considering better
of it, admits the practice as to the scythians, and, in general, all
cavalry whatever, he again attacks him with the [[example]] of the
lacedaemonian foot--a nation of all other the most obstinate in
maintaining their ground--who, in the [[battle]] of plataea, not being able
to break into the persian phalanx, bethought themselves to disperse and
retire, that by the [[enemy]] supposing they fled, they might break and
disunite that vast [[body]] of [[men]] in the pursuit, and by that stratagem
obtained the [[victory]].

as for the scythians, ‘tis said of them, that when darius went his
expedition to subdue them, he sent, by a herald, highly to reproach their
king, that he always retired before him and declined a [[battle]]; to which
idanthyrses,--[herod., iv.  127.]--for that was his name, returned
answer, that it was not for [[fear]] of him, or of any [[man]] living, that he
did so, but that it was the way of marching in practice with his nation,
who had neither tilled fields, cities [[city]], nor houses to defend, or to fear
the [[enemy]] should make any advantage of but that if he had such a stomach
to [[fight]], let him but come to view their ancient places of sepulture, and
there he should have his fill.

nevertheless, as to cannon-shot, when a [[body]] of [[men]] are drawn up in the
face of a train of artillery, as the [[occasion]] of [[war]] often requires, it
is unhandsome to quit their post to avoid the danger, forasmuch as by
reason of its [[violence]] and swiftness we account it inevitable; and many a
one, by ducking, stepping aside, and such other motions of [[fear]], has
been, at all events, sufficiently laughed at by his companions.  and yet,
in the expedition that the [[emperor]] charles v. made against us into
provence, the marquis de guast going to reconnoitre the [[city]] of arles,
and advancing out of the cover of a windmill, under favour of which he
had made his approach, was perceived by the seigneurs de bonneval and the
seneschal of agenois, who were walking upon the ‘theatre aux ayenes’; who
having shown him to the sieur de villiers, commissary of the artillery,
he pointed a culverin so admirably well, and levelled it so exactly right
against him, that had not the marquis, seeing [[fire]] given to it, slipped
aside, it was certainly concluded the shot had taken him full in the
body.  and, in like manner, some years before, lorenzo de’ medici, duke
of urbino, and [[father]] to the queen-mother--[catherine de’ medici, mother
of henry iii.]--laying siege to mondolfo, a place in the territories of
the vicariat in [[italy]], seeing the cannoneer give [[fire]] to a piece that
pointed directly against him, it was well for him that he ducked, for
otherwise the shot, that only razed the top of his head, had doubtless
hit him full in the breast.  to say [[truth]], i do not [[think]] that these
evasions are performed upon the account of [[judgment]]; for how can any man
living [[judge]] of high or low aim on so sudden an [[occasion]]?  and it is much
more easy to [[believe]] that [[fortune]] favoured their apprehension, and that
it might be as well at another [[time]] to make them face the danger, as to
seek to avoid it.  for my own part, i confess i cannot forbear starting
when the rattle of a harquebuse thunders in my ears on a sudden, and in a
place where i am not to expect it, which i have also observed in others,
braver fellows than i.

neither do the stoics pretend that the [[soul]] of their philosopher need be
proof against the first visions and fantasies that surprise him; but, as
to a [[natural]] subjection, [[consent]] that he should tremble at the terrible
noise of thunder, or the sudden clatter of some falling ruin, and be
affrighted even to paleness and convulsion; and so in other [[passions]],
provided his [[judgment]] remain sound and entire, and that the seat of his
reason suffer no concussion nor alteration, and that he yield no consent
to his fright and discomposure.  to him who is not a philosopher, a
fright is the same thing in the first part of it, but quite another thing
in the second; for the impression of [[passions]] does not remain
superficially in him, but penetrates farther, even to the very seat of
reason, infecting and corrupting it, so that he judges [[judge]] according to his
fear, and conforms his behaviour to it. in this verse you may see the
true [[state]] of the [[wise]] stoic learnedly and plainly expressed:--

          “mens immota manet; lachrymae volvuntur inanes.”

          [“though tears flow, the [[mind]] remains unmoved.”
           --virgil, aeneid, iv. 449]

the peripatetic sage does not exempt himself totally from perturbations
of [[mind]], but he moderates them.

chapter xiii

the [[ceremony]] of the interview of princes

there is no [[subject]] so frivolous that does not [[merit]] a place in this
rhapsody.  according to our [[common]] [[rule]] of civility, it would be a
notable affront to an [[equal]], and much more to a superior, to fail being
at [[home]] when he has given you notice he will come to visit you.  nay,
queen margaret of navarre--[marguerite de valois, authoress of the
‘heptameron’]--further adds, that it would be a rudeness in a gentleman
to go out, as we so often do, to meet any that is coming to see him, let
him be of what high condition soever; and that it is more respectful and
more civil to stay at [[home]] to receive him, if only upon the account of
missing him by the way, and that it is enough to receive him at the door,
and to wait upon him.  for my part, who as much as i can endeavour to
reduce the ceremonies [[ceremony]] of my house, i very often forget both the one and
the other of these [[vain]] offices.  if, peradventure, some one may take
offence at this, i can’t [[help]] it; it is much [[better]] to offend him once
than myself every day, for it would be a perpetual [[slavery]].  to what end
do we avoid the servile attendance of courts, if we bring the same
trouble [[home]] to our own private houses?  it is also a [[common]] [[rule]] in all
assemblies, that those of less quality are to be first upon the place, by
reason that it is more due to the [[better]] sort to make others wait and
expect them.

nevertheless, at the interview betwixt [[pope]] clement and [[king]] francis at
marseilles,--[in 1533.]--the [[king]], after he had taken order for the
necessary preparations for his reception and entertainment, withdrew out
of the town, and gave the [[pope]] two or three days’ respite for his entry,
and to repose and refresh himself, before he came to him.  and in like
manner, at the assignation of the [[pope]] and the [[emperor]],--[charles v.  in
1532.] at bologna, the [[emperor]] gave the [[pope]] opportunity to come thither
first, and came himself after; for which the [[reason]] given was this, that
at all the interviews of such princes [[prince]], the greater ought to be first at
the appointed place, especially before the other in whose territories the
interview is appointed to be, intimating thereby a [[kind]] of deference to
the other, it appearing proper for the less to seek out and to apply
themselves to the greater, and not the greater to them.

not every [[country]] only, but every [[city]] and every [[society]] has its
particular forms of civility.  there was [[care]] enough to this taken in my
education, and i have lived in [[good]] company enough to [[know]] the
formalities of our own nation, and am able to give lessons in it.  i love
to [[follow]] them, but not to be so servilely tied to their observation that
my whole [[life]] should be enslaved to ceremonies [[ceremony]], of which there are some
so troublesome that, provided a [[man]] omits them out of discretion, and not
for want of breeding, it will be every whit as handsome.  i have seen
some [[people]] rude, by being overcivil and troublesome in their courtesy.

still, these excesses excepted, the [[knowledge]] of courtesy and good
manners is a very necessary study.  it is, like grace and [[beauty]], that
which begets liking and an inclination to [[love]] one another at the first
sight, and in the very beginning of acquaintance; and, consequently, that
which first opens the door and intromits us to instruct ourselves by the
example of others, and to give examples [[example]] ourselves, if we have any worth
taking notice of and communicating.




chapter xiv

that [[men]] are justly punished for being obstinate in the defence
of a fort that is not in [[reason]] to be defended

valour has its bounds as well as other virtues [[virtue]], which, once transgressed,
the next step is into the territories of [[vice]]; so that by having too
large a proportion of this heroic [[virtue]], unless a [[man]] be very [[perfect]] in
its limits, which upon the confines are very hard to discern, he may very
easily unawares run into temerity, obstinacy, and folly.  from this
consideration it is that we have derived the custom, in times [[time]] of [[war]], to
punish, even with [[death]], those who are obstinate to defend a place that
by the rules [[rule]] of [[war]] is not tenable; otherwise [[men]] would be so confident
upon the [[hope]] of impunity, that not a henroost but would resist and seek
to stop an [[army]].

the constable monsieur de montmorenci, having at the siege of pavia been
ordered to pass the ticino, and to take up his quarters in the faubourg
st. antonio, being hindered by a tower at the end of the bridge, which
was so obstinate as to endure a battery, [[hanged]] every [[man]] he found within
it for their [[labour]].  and again, accompanying the dauphin in his
expedition beyond the alps, and taking the castle of villano by assault,
and all within it being put to the [[sword]] by the fury of the soldiers, the
governor and his ensign only excepted, he caused them both to be trussed
up for the same [[reason]]; as also did the captain martin du bellay, then
governor of turin, with the governor of san buono, in the same [[country]],
all his [[people]] having been cut to pieces at the taking of the place.

but forasmuch as the [[strength]] or weakness of a fortress is always
measured by the estimate and counterpoise of the forces [[force]] that attack it
--for a [[man]] might reasonably enough despise two culverins, that would be
a madman to abide a battery of thirty pieces of cannon--where also the
greatness of the [[prince]] who is master of the field, his [[reputation]], and
the [[respect]] that is due unto him, are also put into the balance, there is
danger that the balance be pressed too much in that direction.  and it
may happen that a [[man]] is possessed with so [[great]] an [[opinion]] of himself
and his [[power]], that thinking it unreasonable any place should dare to
shut its gates against him, he puts all to the [[sword]] where he meets with
any opposition, whilst his [[fortune]] continues; as is plain in the fierce
and arrogant forms of summoning towns and denouncing [[war]], savouring so
much of barbarian [[pride]] and insolence, in use amongst the oriental
princes, and which their successors to this day do yet retain and
practise.  and in that part of the [[world]] where the portuguese subdued the
indians, they found some states where it was a universal and inviolable
law amongst them that every [[enemy]] overcome by the [[king]] in [[person]], or by
his lieutenant, was out of composition.

so above all both of ransom and [[mercy]] a [[man]] should take heed, if he can,
of falling into the hands of a [[judge]] who is an [[enemy]] and victorious.




chapter xv

of the [[punishment]] of cowardice

i once heard of a [[prince]], and a [[great]] captain, having a narration given
him as he sat at table of the proceeding against monsieur de vervins, who
was sentenced to [[death]] for having surrendered boulogne to the english,
--[to henry viii. in 1544]--openly maintaining that a soldier could not
justly be put to [[death]] for want of [[courage]].  and, in [[truth]], ‘tis reason
that a [[man]] should make a [[great]] difference betwixt faults [[fault]] that merely
proceed from infirmity, and those that are visibly the effects of
treachery and malice: for, in the [[last]], we act against the rules [[rule]] of
reason that [[nature]] has imprinted in us; whereas, in the former, it seems
as if we might [[produce]] the same [[nature]], who left us in such a [[state]] of
imperfection and weakness of [[courage]], for our justification.  insomuch
that many have [[thought]] we are not fairly questionable for anything but
what we commit against our [[conscience]]; and it is partly upon this rule
that those ground their [[opinion]] who disapprove of [[capital]] or sanguinary
punishments inflicted upon heretics and misbelievers; and theirs also who
advocate or a [[judge]] is not accountable for having from mere ignorance
failed in his administration.

but as to cowardice, it is [[certain]] that the most usual way of chastising
it is by ignominy and and it is supposed that this practice brought into
use by the legislator charondas; and that, before his [[time]], the laws [[law]] of
greece punished those with [[death]] who fled from a [[battle]]; whereas he
ordained only that they be for three days exposed in the [[public]] dressed
in woman’s attire, hoping yet for some service from them, having awakened
their [[courage]] by this open shame:

          “suffundere malis homims sanguinem, quam effundere.”

     [“rather bring the [[blood]] into a man’s cheek than let it out of his
     [[body]].”  tertullian in his apologetics.]

it appears also that the roman laws [[law]] did anciently punish those with death
who had run away; for ammianus marcellinus says that the [[emperor]] julian
commanded ten of his soldiers, who had turned their backs in an encounter
against the parthians, to be first degraded, and afterward put to [[death]],
according, says he, to the ancient laws [[law]],--[ammianus marcellinus, xxiv.
4; xxv. i.]--and yet elsewhere for the like offence he only condemned
others to remain amongst the prisoners [[prisoner]] under the baggage ensign.  the
severe [[punishment]] the [[people]] of [[rome]] inflicted upon those who fled from
the [[battle]] of cannae, and those who ran away with aeneius fulvius at his
defeat, did not extend to [[death]].  and yet, methinks, ‘tis to be feared,
lest disgrace should make such delinquents desperate, and not only faint
friends, but enemies [[enemy]].

of late memory,--[in 1523]--the seigneur de frauget, lieutenant to the
mareschal de chatillon’s company, having by the mareschal de chabannes
been put in [[government]] of fuentarabia in the place of monsieur de lude,
and having surrendered it to the spaniard, he was for that condemned to
be degraded from all nobility, and both himself and his posterity
declared ignoble, taxable, and for ever incapable of bearing arms, which
severe sentence was afterwards accordingly executed at lyons.--[in 1536]
--and, since that, all the gentlemen who were in guise when the count of
nassau entered into it, underwent the same [[punishment]], as several others
have done since for the like offence.  notwithstanding, in case of such a
manifest ignorance or cowardice as exceeds all ordinary [[example]], ‘tis but
reason to take it for a sufficient proof of treachery and malice, and for
such to be punished.




chapter xvi

a proceeding of some ambassadors

i observe in my travels this custom, ever to learn something from the
information of those with whom i confer (which is the [[best]] school of all
others), and to put my company upon those subjects [[subject]] they are the [[best]] able
to speak of:--

               “basti al nocchiero ragionar de’ venti,
               al bifolco dei tori; et le sue piaghe
               conti’l guerrier; conti’l pastor gli armenti.”

     [“let the sailor content himself with talking of the winds; the
     cowherd of his oxen; the soldier of his wounds; the shepherd of his
     flocks.”--an italian translation of propertius, ii. i, 43]

for it often falls out that, on the contrary, every one will rather
choose to be prating of another man’s province than his own, thinking it
so much new [[reputation]] acquired; witness the jeer archidamus put upon
pertander, “that he had quitted the [[glory]] of being an excellent physician
to gain the repute of a very [[bad]] poet.--[plutarch, apoth. of the
lacedaemonians, ‘in voce’ archidamus.]--and do but observe how large and
ample caesar is to make us [[understand]] his inventions of building bridges
and contriving engines of [[war]],--[de bello gall., iv. 17.]--and how
succinct and reserved in comparison, where he speaks of the offices of
his profession, his own valour, and [[military]] conduct.  his exploits
sufficiently prove him a [[great]] captain, and that he knew well enough; but
he would be [[thought]] an excellent engineer to boot; a quality something
different, and not necessary to be expected in him.  the elder dionysius
was a very [[great]] captain, as it befitted his [[fortune]] he should be; but he
took very [[great]] pains [[pain]] to get a particular [[reputation]] by poetry, and yet
he was never cut out for a poet.  a [[man]] of the legal profession being not
long since brought to see a study furnished with all sorts of books [[book]], both
of his own and all other faculties, took no [[occasion]] at all to entertain
himself with any of them, but fell very rudely and magisterially to
descant upon a barricade placed on the winding stair before the study
door, a thing that a hundred captains and [[common]] soldiers see every day
without taking any notice or offence.

          “optat ephippia bos piger, optat arare caballus.”

     [“the lazy ox desires [[desire]] a saddle and bridle; the horse wants to
     plough.”--hor., ep., i. 14,43.]

by this course a [[man]] shall never improve himself, nor arrive at any
perfection in anything.  he must, therefore, make it his [[business]] always
to put the architect, the painter, the statuary, every mechanic artisan,
upon discourse of their own capacities.

and, to this [[purpose]], in reading histories [[history]], which is everybody’s [[subject]],
i use to consider what [[kind]] of [[men]] are the authors: if they be persons
that profess nothing but mere letters, i, in and from them, principally
observe and learn style and [[language]]; if physicians, i the rather incline
to credit what they report of the temperature of the air, of the health
and complexions of princes [[prince]], of wounds and diseases; if lawyers, we are
from them to take notice of the controversies of rights [[right]] and wrongs [[wrong]], the
establishment of laws [[law]] and civil [[government]], and the like; if divines, the
affairs of the [[church]], ecclesiastical censures, marriages [[marriage]], and
dispensations; if courtiers, manners and ceremonies [[ceremony]]; if soldiers, the
things that properly belong to their [[trade]], and, principally, the
accounts of the actions and enterprises wherein they were personally
engaged; if ambassadors, we are to observe negotiations, intelligences,
and practices, and the manner how they are to be carried on.

and this is the [[reason]] why (which perhaps i should have lightly passed
over in another) i dwelt upon and maturely considered one passage in the
history written by monsieur de langey, a [[man]] of very [[great]] [[judgment]] in
things of that [[nature]]: after having given a narrative of the fine oration
charles v. had made in the consistory at [[rome]], and in the presence of the
bishop of macon and monsieur du velly, our ambassadors there, wherein he
had mixed several injurious expressions to the dishonour of our nation;
and amongst the rest, “that if his captains and soldiers were not [[men]] of
another [[kind]] of fidelity, resolution, and sufficiency in the [[knowledge]] of
arms than those of the [[king]], he would immediately go with a rope about
his neck and sue to him for mercy” (and it should seem the [[emperor]] had
really this, or a very little [[better]] [[opinion]] of our [[military]] [[men]], for he
afterwards, twice or thrice in his [[life]], said the very same thing); as
also, that he challenged the [[king]] to [[fight]] him in his shirt with rapier
and poignard in a boat.  the said sieur de langey, pursuing his [[history]],
adds that the forenamed ambassadors, sending a despatch to the [[king]] of
these things, concealed the [[greatest]] part, and particularly the [[last]] two
passages.  at which i could not but wonder that it should be in the power
of an ambassador to dispense with anything which he ought to signify to
his master, especially of so [[great]] importance as this, coming from the
mouth of such a [[person]], and spoken in so [[great]] an assembly; and i should
rather conceive it had been the servant’s [[duty]] faithfully to have
represented to him the whole thing as it passed, to the end that the
liberty of selecting, disposing, judging, and concluding might have
remained in him: for either to conceal or to [[disguise]] the [[truth]] for fear
he should take it otherwise than he ought to do, and lest it should
prompt him to some extravagant resolution, and, in the meantime, to leave
him ignorant of his affairs, should seem, methinks, rather to belong to
him who is to give the [[law]] than to him who is only to receive it; to him
who is in supreme command, and not to him who ought to look upon himself
as inferior, not only in [[authority]], but also in prudence and good
counsel.  i, for my part, would not be so served in my little concerns.

we so willingly slip the collar of command upon any pretence whatever,
and are so ready to usurp upon dominion, every one does so naturally
aspire to [[liberty]] and [[power]], that no utility whatever derived from the
wit or valour of those he employs ought to be so dear to a superior as a
downright and sincere [[obedience]].  to obey more upon the account of
understanding than of subjection, is to [[corrupt]] the office of command
--[taken from aulus gellius, i. 13.]--; insomuch that p. crassus, the same
whom the romans reputed five times [[time]] [[happy]], at the [[time]] when he was consul
in [[asia]], having sent to a [[greek]] engineer to cause the greater of two
masts of ships that he had taken notice of at [[athens]] to be brought to
him, to be employed about some engine of battery he had a design to make;
the other, presuming upon his own [[science]] and sufficiency in those
affairs, [[thought]] fit to do otherwise than directed, and to bring the
less, which, according to the rules [[rule]] of art [[arts]], was really more proper for
the use to which it was designed; but crassus, though he gave ear to his
reasons with [[great]] patience, would not, however, take them, how sound or
convincing soever, for current [[pay]], but caused him to be well whipped for
his pains [[pain]], valuing the interest of discipline much more than that of the
work in hand.

notwithstanding, we may on the other side consider that so precise and
implicit an [[obedience]] as this is only due to positive and limited
commands.  the employment of ambassadors is never so confined, many
things in their management of affairs being wholly referred to the
absolute sovereignty of their own conduct; they do not simply execute,
but also, to their own discretion and [[wisdom]], form and model their
master’s [[pleasure]].  i have, in my [[time]], known [[men]] of command checked for
having rather obeyed the express words of the king’s letters, than the
necessity of the affairs they had in hand.  [[men]] of understanding do yet,
to this day, condemn the custom of the kings [[king]] of [[persia]] to give their
lieutenants and agents so little rein, that, upon the least arising
difficulties, they must fain have recourse to their further commands;
this delay, in so vast an extent of dominion, having often very much
prejudiced their affairs; and crassus, writing to a [[man]] whose profession
it was [[best]] to [[understand]] those things, and pre-acquainting him to what
use this mast was designed, did he not seem to consult his [[advice]], and in
a manner invite him to interpose his [[better]] [[judgment]]?




chapter xvii

of fear

          “obstupui, steteruntque comae et vox faucibus haesit.”

     [“i was amazed, my hair stood on end, and my voice stuck in my
     throat.”  [[virgil]], aeneid, ii.  774.]

i am not so [[good]] a naturalist (as they call it) as to discern by what
secret springs [[fear]] has its motion in us; but, be this as it may, ‘tis a
strange passion, and such a one that the physicians say there is no other
whatever that sooner dethrones our [[judgment]] from its proper seat; which
is so true, that i myself have seen very many become frantic through
fear; and, even in those of the [[best]] settled temper it is most certain
that it begets a terrible astonishment and confusion during the fit.
i omit the vulgar sort, to whom it one while represents their
great-grandsires risen out of their graves in their shrouds, another while
werewolves, nightmares, and chimaeras; but even amongst soldiers, a sort
of [[men]] over whom, of all others, it ought to have the least [[power]], how
often has it converted flocks of sheep into armed squadrons, reeds and
bullrushes into pikes and lances, [[friends]] into enemies [[enemy]], and the french
white cross into the red cross of spain!  when monsieur de bourbon took
rome,--[in 1527]--an ensign who was upon guard at borgo san pietro was
seized with such a fright upon the first alarm, that he threw himself out
at a breach with his colours upon his shoulder, and ran directly upon the
enemy, thinking he had retreated toward the inward defences of the [[city]],
and with much ado, seeing monsieur de bourbon’s [[people]], who [[thought]] it
had been a sally upon them, draw up to receive him, at [[last]] came to
himself, and saw his error; and then facing about, he retreated full
speed through the same breach by which he had gone out, but not till he
had first blindly advanced above three hundred paces into the open field.
it did not, however, fall out so well with captain giulio’s ensign, at
the [[time]] when st. paul was taken from us by the comte de bures and
monsieur de reu, for he, being so astonished with [[fear]] as to throw
himself, colours and all, out of a porthole, was immediately, cut to
pieces by the [[enemy]]; and in the same siege, it was a very memorable fear
that so seized, contracted, and froze up the [[heart]] of a gentleman, that
he sank down, stone-dead, in the breach, without any manner of wound or
hurt at all.  the like madness does sometimes push on a whole multitude;
for in one of the encounters that germanicus had with the germans, two
great parties were so amazed with [[fear]] that they ran two opposite ways,
the one to the same place from which the other had fled.--[tacit, annal.,
i.  63.]--sometimes it adds wings to the heels, as in the two first:
sometimes it nails them to the ground, and fetters them from moving; as
we [[read]] of the [[emperor]] theophilus, who, in a [[battle]] he lost against the
agarenes, was so astonished and stupefied that he had no [[power]] to fly--

               “adeo pavor etiam auxilia formidat”

     [“so much does [[fear]] dread even the means of safety.”--quint.
     curt., ii.  ii.]

--till such [[time]] as manuel, one of the principal commanders of his [[army]],
having jogged and shaked him so as to rouse him out of his trance, said
to him, “sir, if you will not [[follow]] me, i will kill you; for it is
better you should lose your [[life]] than, by being taken, lose your [[empire]].”
 --[zonaras, lib.  iii.]--but [[fear]] does then manifest its utmost power
when it throws us upon a valiant despair, having before deprived us of
all sense both of [[duty]] and [[honour]].  in the first pitched [[battle]] the
romans lost against hannibal, under the consul sempronius, a [[body]] of ten
thousand foot, that had taken fright, seeing no other escape for their
cowardice, went and threw themselves headlong upon the [[great]] battalion of
the enemies [[enemy]], which with marvellous [[force]] and fury they charged through
and through, and routed with a very [[great]] slaughter of the carthaginians,
thus purchasing an ignominious flight at the same price they might have
gained a glorious [[victory]].--[livy, xxi.  56.]

the thing in the [[world]] i am most afraid of is [[fear]], that passion alone,
in the trouble of it, exceeding all other accidents.  what affliction
could be greater or more just than that of pompey’s [[friends]], who, in his
ship, were spectators of that horrible murder?  yet so it was, that the
fear of the egyptian vessels they saw coming to board them, possessed
them with so [[great]] alarm that it is observed they [[thought]] of nothing but
calling upon the mariners to make haste, and by [[force]] of oars to escape
away, till being arrived at tyre, and delivered from [[fear]], they had
leisure to turn their thoughts [[thought]] to the loss of their captain, and to give
vent to those tears and lamentations that the other more potent passion
had till then suspended.

          “tum pavor sapientiam omnem mihiex animo expectorat.”

     [“then [[fear]] drove out all [[intelligence]] from my [[mind]].”--ennius, ap.
     cicero, tusc., iv.  8.]

such as have been well rubbed in some skirmish, may yet, all wounded and
bloody as they are, be brought on again the next day to charge; but such
as have once conceived a [[good]] sound [[fear]] of the [[enemy]], will never be made
so much as to look him in the face.  such as are in immediate [[fear]] of a
losing their estates, of [[banishment]], or of [[slavery]], [[live]] in perpetual
anguish, and lose all appetite and repose; whereas such as are actually
poor, slaves [[slave]], or exiles, ofttimes [[live]] as merrily as other folk.  and the
many [[people]] who, impatient of the perpetual alarms of [[fear]], have hanged
or drowned themselves, or dashed themselves to pieces, give us
sufficiently to [[understand]] that [[fear]] is more importunate and
insupportable than [[death]] itself.

the greeks [[greek]] acknowledged another [[kind]] of [[fear]], differing from any we have
spoken of yet, that surprises us without any visible cause, by an impulse
from [[heaven]], so that whole nations and whole armies [[army]] have been struck with
it.  such a one was that which brought so wonderful a desolation upon
carthage, where nothing was to be heard but affrighted voices and
outcries; where the inhabitants were seen to sally out of their houses as
to an alarm, and there to charge, wound, and kill one another, as if they
had been enemies [[enemy]] come to surprise their [[city]].  all things were in
disorder and fury till, with prayers and sacrifices [[sacrifice]], they had appeased
their gods--[diod.  sic., xv. 7]; and this is that they call panic
terrors.--[ibid. ; plutarch on isis and osiris, c.  8.]




chapter xviii

that [[men]] are not to [[judge]] of our [[happiness]] till after [[death]].

     [charron has borrowed with unusual liberality from this and the
     succeeding [[chapter]].  see nodier, questions [[question]], p. 206.]

                         “scilicet ultima semper
               exspectanda dies homini est; dicique beatus
               ante obitum nemo supremaque funera debet.”

     [“we should all look forward to our [[last]] day: no one can be called
     [[happy]] till he is [[dead]] and buried.”--ovid, met, iii. 135]

the very [[children]] [[know]] the story of [[king]] croesus to this [[purpose]], who
being taken [[prisoner]] by cyrus, and by him condemned to [[die]], as he was
going to execution cried out, “o solon, solon!”  which being presently
reported to cyrus, and he sending to inquire of him what it meant,
croesus gave him to [[understand]] that he now found the teaching solon had
formerly given him true to his cost; which was, “that [[men]], however
fortune may smile upon them, could never be said to be [[happy]] till they
had been seen to pass over the [[last]] day of their lives [[life]],” by [[reason]] of the
uncertainty and mutability of [[human]] things, which, upon very [[light]] and
trivial occasions [[occasion]], are [[subject]] to be totally changed into a quite
contrary condition.  and so it was that agesilaus made [[answer]] to one who
was saying what a [[happy]] [[young]] [[man]] the [[king]] of [[persia]] was, to come so
young to so mighty a [[kingdom]]: “‘tis true,” said he, “but neither was
priam unhappy at his years.”--[plutarch, apothegms of the
lacedaemonians.]--in a short [[time]], kings [[king]] of macedon, successors to that
mighty alexander, became joiners and scriveners at [[rome]]; a [[tyrant]] of
sicily, a pedant at corinth; a conqueror of one-half of the [[world]] and
general of so many armies [[army]], a miserable suppliant to the rascally officers
of a [[king]] of [[egypt]]: so much did the prolongation of five or six months of
life cost the [[great]] pompey; and, in our fathers’ days, ludovico sforza,
the tenth duke of milan, whom all [[italy]] had so long truckled under, was
seen to [[die]] a wretched [[prisoner]] at loches, but not till he had lived ten
years in captivity,--[he was imprisoned by louis xi. in an iron cage]--
which was the worst part of his [[fortune]].  the fairest of all queens,
--[mary, queen of scots.]--widow to the [[greatest]] [[king]] in [[europe]], did she
not come to [[die]] by the hand of an executioner?  unworthy and barbarous
cruelty!  and a thousand more examples [[example]] there are of the same [[kind]]; for it
seems that as storms and tempests have a malice against the proud and
overtowering heights of our lofty buildings, there are also spirits above
that are envious of the greatnesses here below:

              “usque adeo res humanas vis abdita quaedam
               obterit, et pulchros fasces, saevasque secures
               proculcare, ac ludibrio sibi habere videtur.”

     [“so true it is that some occult [[power]] upsets [[human]] affairs, the
     glittering fasces and the cruel axes spurns under foot, and seems to
     make [[sport]] of them.”--lucretius, v.  1231.]

and it should seem, also, that [[fortune]] sometimes lies [[lie]] in wait to surprise
the [[last]] hour of our lives [[life]], to show the [[power]] she has, in a moment, to
overthrow what she was so many years in building, making us cry out with
laberius:

                         “nimirum hac die
          una plus vixi mihi, quam vivendum fuit.”

     [“i have lived longer by this one day than i should have
     done.”--macrobius, ii.  7.]

and, in this sense, this [[good]] [[advice]] of solon may reasonably be taken;
but he, being a philosopher (with which sort of [[men]] the favours and
disgraces of [[fortune]] stand for nothing, either to the making a [[man]] happy
or unhappy, and with whom grandeurs and powers [[power]] are accidents of a quality
almost indifferent) i am apt to [[think]] that he had some further aim, and
that his meaning was, that the very felicity of [[life]] itself, which
depends upon the tranquillity and contentment of a well-descended spirit,
and the resolution and assurance of a well-ordered [[soul]], ought never to
be attributed to any [[man]] till he has first been seen to play the [[last]],
and, doubtless, the hardest act of his part.  there may be [[disguise]] and
dissimulation in all the rest: where these fine philosophical discourses
are only put on, and where accident, not touching us to the quick, gives
us leisure to maintain the same gravity of aspect; but, in this last
scene of [[death]], there is no more counterfeiting: we must speak out plain,
and discover what there is of [[good]] and clean in the bottom of the pot,

              “nam vera; voces turn demum pectore ab imo
               ejiciuntur; et eripitur persona, manet res.”

     [“then at [[last]] [[truth]] issues from the [[heart]]; the visor’s gone,
     the [[man]] remains.”--lucretius, iii.  57.]

wherefore, at this [[last]], all the other actions of our [[life]] ought to be
tried and sifted: ‘tis the master-day, ‘tis the day that is [[judge]] of all
the rest, “‘tis the day,” says one of the ancients,--[seneca, ep., 102]--
“that must be [[judge]] of all my foregoing years.”  to [[death]] do i refer the
assay of the fruit of all my studies: we shall then see whether my
discourses came only from my mouth or from my [[heart]].  i have seen many by
their [[death]] give a [[good]] or an ill repute to their whole [[life]].  scipio,
the father-in-law of pompey, in dying, well removed the ill [[opinion]] that
till then every one had conceived of him.  epaminondas being [[asked]] which
of the three he had in [[greatest]] esteem, chabrias, iphicrates, or himself.
“you must first see us [[die]],” said he, “before that [[question]] can be
resolved.”--[plutarch, apoth.]--and, in [[truth]], he would infinitely
wrong that [[man]] who would weigh him without the [[honour]] and grandeur of his
end.

god has ordered all things as it has [[best]] pleased him; but i have, in my
time, seen three of the most execrable persons [[person]] that ever i knew in all
manner of abominable living, and the most infamous to boot, who all died
a very regular [[death]], and in all circumstances composed, even to
perfection.  there are brave and fortunate deaths [[death]]: i have seen [[death]] cut
the thread of the [[progress]] of a prodigious advancement, and in the height
and flower of its increase, of a [[certain]] [[person]],--[montaigne doubtless
refers to his friend etienne de la boetie, at whose [[death]] in 1563 he was
present.]--with so glorious an end that, in my [[opinion]], his ambitious
and generous designs had nothing in them so high and [[great]] as their
interruption.  he arrived, without completing his course, at the place to
which his [[ambition]] aimed, with greater [[glory]] than he could either have
hoped or [[desired]], anticipating by his fall the name and [[power]] to which he
aspired in perfecting his [[career]].  in the [[judgment]] i make of another
man’s [[life]], i always observe how he carried himself at his [[death]]; and the
principal concern i have for my own is that i may [[die]] well--that is,
patiently and tranquilly.




chapter xix

that to study philosopy is to learn to die

cicero says--[tusc., i.  31.]--“that to study [[philosophy]] is nothing but
to prepare one’s [[self]] to [[die]].”  the [[reason]] of which is, because study and
contemplation do in some sort withdraw from us our [[soul]], and employ it
separately from the [[body]], which is a [[kind]] of apprenticeship and a
resemblance of [[death]]; or, else, because all the [[wisdom]] and reasoning in
the [[world]] do in the end conclude in this point, to [[teach]] us not to fear
to [[die]].  and to say the [[truth]], either our [[reason]] mocks us, or it ought to
have no other aim but our contentment only, nor to endeavour anything
but, in sum, to make us [[live]] well, and, as the holy [[scripture]] says, at
our ease.  all the opinions [[opinion]] of the [[world]] agree in this, that [[pleasure]] is
our end, though we make use of divers means to attain it: they would,
otherwise, be rejected at the first motion; for who would give ear to him
that should propose affliction and misery for his end?  the controversies
and disputes of the philosophical sects upon this point are merely
verbal:

               “transcurramus solertissimas nugas”

     [“let us skip over those subtle trifles.”--seneca, ep., 117.]

--there is more in them of opposition and obstinacy than is consistent
with so [[sacred]] a profession; but whatsoever personage a [[man]] takes upon
himself to perform, he ever mixes his own part with it.

let the [[philosophers]] say what they will, the thing at which we all aim,
even in [[virtue]] is [[pleasure]].  it amuses me to rattle in ears this word,
which they so nauseate to and if it signify some supreme [[pleasure]] and
contentment, it is more due to the assistance of [[virtue]] than to any other
assistance whatever.  this [[pleasure]], for being more [[gay]], more sinewy,
more robust and more manly, is only the more seriously voluptuous, and we
ought give it the name of [[pleasure]], as that which is more favourable,
gentle, and [[natural]], and not that from which we have denominated it.  the
other and meaner [[pleasure]], if it could deserve this [[fair]] name, it ought
to be by way of competition, and not of [[privilege]].  i find it less exempt
from traverses and inconveniences than [[virtue]] itself; and, besides that
the enjoyment is more momentary, fluid, and frail, it has its watchings,
fasts, and labours [[labour]], its sweat and its [[blood]]; and, moreover, has
particular to itself so many several sorts of sharp and wounding
passions, and so dull a satiety attending it, as [[equal]] it to the severest
penance.  and we mistake if we [[think]] that these incommodities serve it
for a spur and a seasoning to its sweetness (as in [[nature]] one contrary is
quickened by another), or say, when we come to [[virtue]], that like
consequences and difficulties overwhelm and render it austere and
inaccessible; whereas, much more aptly than in voluptuousness, they
ennoble, sharpen, and heighten the [[perfect]] and [[divine]] [[pleasure]] they
procure us.  he renders himself unworthy of it who will counterpoise its
cost with its fruit, and neither understands the blessing nor how to use
it.  those who preach to us that the quest of it is craggy, difficult,
and painful, but its fruition pleasant, what do they mean by that but to
tell us that it is always unpleasing?  for what [[human]] means will ever
attain its enjoyment?  the most [[perfect]] have been fain to content
themselves to aspire unto it, and to approach it only, without ever
possessing it.  but they are deceived, seeing that of all the pleasures
we [[know]], the very pursuit is pleasant.  the attempt ever relishes of the
quality of the thing to which it is directed, for it is a [[good]] part of,
and consubstantial with, the effect.  the felicity and beatitude that
glitters in [[virtue]], shines throughout all her appurtenances and avenues,
even to the first entry and utmost limits.

now, of all the benefits that [[virtue]] confers upon us, the contempt of
death is one of the [[greatest]], as the means that accommodates [[human]] life
with a soft and easy tranquillity, and gives us a pure and pleasant taste
of living, without which all other [[pleasure]] would be extinct.  which is
the [[reason]] why all the rules [[rule]] centre and concur in this one article.  and
although they all in like manner, with [[common]] accord, [[teach]] us also to
despise [[pain]], [[poverty]], and the other accidents to which [[human]] [[life]] is
subject, it is not, nevertheless, with the same solicitude, as well by
reason these accidents are not of so [[great]] necessity, the greater part of
mankind passing over their whole lives [[life]] without ever knowing what poverty
is, and some without [[sorrow]] or sickness, as xenophilus the musician, who
lived a hundred and six years in a [[perfect]] and continual health; as also
because, at the worst, [[death]] can, whenever we please, cut short and put
an end to all other inconveniences.  but as to [[death]], it is inevitable:--

              “omnes eodem cogimur; omnium
               versatur urna serius ocius
               sors exitura, et nos in aeternum
               exilium impositura cymbae.”

     [“we are all bound one [[voyage]]; the lot of all, sooner or later, is
     to come out of the urn.  all must to eternal [[exile]] sail away.”
       --hor., od., ii.  3, 25.]

and, consequently, if it frights us, ‘tis a perpetual torment, for which
there is no sort of consolation.  there is no way by which it may not
reach us.  we may continually turn our heads this way and that, as in a
suspected [[country]]:

          “quae, quasi saxum tantalo, semper impendet.”

          [“ever, like tantalus stone, hangs over us.”
            --cicero, de finib., i. 18.]

our courts of [[justice]] often send back condemned criminals [[criminal]] to be executed
upon the place where the crime was committed; but, carry them to fine
houses by the way, prepare for them the [[best]] entertainment you can--

                    “non siculae dapes
               dulcem elaborabunt saporem:
               non avium cyatheaceae cantus
               somnum reducent.”

     [“sicilian dainties will not tickle their palates, nor the melody of
     birds and harps bring back sleep.”--hor., od., iii. 1, 18.]

do you [[think]] they can relish it? and that the fatal end of their journey
being continually before their [[eyes]], would not alter and deprave their
palate from tasting these regalios?

         “audit iter, numeratque dies, spatioque viarum
          metitur vitam; torquetur peste futura.”

     [“he considers the route, computes the [[time]] of travelling, measuring
     his [[life]] by the length of the [[journey]]; and torments himself by
     thinking of the blow to come.”--claudianus, in ruf., ii.  137.]

the end of our [[race]] is [[death]]; ‘tis the necessary object of our aim,
which, if it fright us, how is it possible to advance a step without a
fit of ague?  the remedy the vulgar use is not to [[think]] on’t; but from
what brutish stupidity can they derive so gross a blindness?  they must
bridle the ass by the tail:

          “qui capite ipse suo instituit vestigia retro,”

     [“who in his folly seeks to advance backwards”--lucretius, iv. 474]

‘tis no wonder if he be often trapped in the pitfall.  they affright
people with the very mention of [[death]], and many cross themselves, as it
were the name of the [[devil]].  and because the making a man’s will is in
reference to dying, not a [[man]] will be persuaded to take a pen in hand to
that [[purpose]], till the physician has passed sentence upon and totally
given him over, and then betwixt and terror, [[god]] knows [[know]] in how fit a
condition of understanding he is to do it.

the romans, by [[reason]] that this [[poor]] syllable [[death]] sounded so harshly to
their ears and seemed so ominous, found out a way to soften and spin it
out by a periphrasis, and instead of pronouncing such a one is [[dead]],
said, “such a one has lived,” or “such a one has ceased to live”
 --[plutarch, [[life]] of cicero, c.  22:]--for, provided there was any mention
of [[life]] in the case, though [[past]], it carried yet some sound of
consolation.  and from them it is that we have borrowed our expression,
“the late monsieur such and such a one.”--[“feu monsieur un tel.”]
peradventure, as the saying is, the term we have lived is worth our
money.  i was born betwixt eleven and twelve o’clock in the forenoon the
last day of february 1533, according to our computation, beginning the
year the 1st of january,--[this was in [[virtue]] of an ordinance of charles
ix. in 1563.  previously the year commenced at easter, so that the 1st
january 1563 became the first day of the year 1563.]--and it is now but
just fifteen days since i was complete nine-and-thirty years old; i make
account to [[live]], at least, as many more.  in the meantime, to trouble a
man’s [[self]] with the [[thought]] of a thing so far off were folly.  but what?
young and old [[die]] upon the same terms; no one departs out of life
otherwise than if he had but just before entered into it; neither is any
man so old and decrepit, who, having heard of methuselah, does not think
he has yet twenty [[good]] years to come.  [[fool]] that thou art!  who has
assured unto thee the term of [[life]]?  thou dependest upon physicians’
tales: rather consult effects and [[experience]].  according to the common
course of things, ‘tis long since that thou hast lived by extraordinary
favour; thou hast already outlived the ordinary term of [[life]].  and that
it is so, reckon up thy acquaintance, how many more have died before they
arrived at thy [[age]] than have attained unto it; and of those who have
ennobled their lives [[life]] by their renown, take but an account, and i dare
lay a wager thou wilt find more who have died before than after
five-and-thirty years of [[age]].  it is full both of [[reason]] and piety, too,
to take [[example]] by the [[humanity]] of [[jesus]] [[christ]] himself; now, he ended
his [[life]] at three-and-thirty years.  the [[greatest]] [[man]], that was no more
than a [[man]], alexander, died also at the same [[age]].  how many several ways
has [[death]] to surprise us?

              “quid quisque, vitet, nunquam homini satis
               cautum est in horas.”

     [“be as cautious as he may, [[man]] can never foresee the danger that
     may at any hour befal him.”--hor. o. ii.  13, 13.]

to omit fevers and pleurisies, who would ever have imagined that a duke
of brittany,--[jean ii. died 1305.]--should be pressed to [[death]] in a
crowd as that duke was at the entry of [[pope]] clement, my neighbour, into
lyons?--[montaigne speaks of him as if he had been a contemporary
neighbour, perhaps because he was the archbishop of bordeaux.  bertrand
le got was [[pope]] under the title of clement v., 1305-14.]--hast thou not
seen one of our kings--[henry ii., killed in a tournament, july 10,
1559]--killed at a tilting, and did not one of his [[ancestors]] [[die]] by
jostle of a hog?--[philip, eldest [[son]] of louis le gros.]--aeschylus,
threatened with the fall of a house, was to much [[purpose]] circumspect to
avoid that danger, seeing that he was knocked on the head by a tortoise
falling out of an eagle’s talons in the air.  another was choked with a
grape-stone;--[val.  max., ix.  12, ext. 2.]--an [[emperor]] killed with
the scratch of a comb in combing his head.  aemilius lepidus with a
stumble at his own threshold,--[pliny, nat.  hist., vii.  33.]--
and aufidius with a jostle against the door as he entered the
council-chamber.  and betwixt the very thighs of [[women]], cornelius gallus
the proctor; tigillinus, captain of the watch at [[rome]]; ludovico, [[son]] of
guido di gonzaga, marquis of mantua; and (of worse example) speusippus, a
platonic philosopher, and one of our popes.  the [[poor]] [[judge]] bebius gave
adjournment in a case for eight days; but he himself, meanwhile, was
condemned by [[death]], and his own stay of [[life]] expired.  whilst caius
julius, the physician, was anointing the [[eyes]] of a patient, [[death]] closed
his own; and, if i may bring in an [[example]] of my own [[blood]], a [[brother]] of
mine, captain st. martin, a [[young]] [[man]], three-and-twenty years old, who
had already given sufficient testimony of his valour, playing a match at
tennis, received a blow of a ball a little above his [[right]] ear, which, as
it gave no manner of sign of wound or contusion, he took no notice of it,
nor so much as sat down to repose himself, but, nevertheless, died within
five or six hours after of an apoplexy occasioned by that blow.

these so frequent and [[common]] examples [[example]] passing every day before our [[eyes]],
how is it possible a [[man]] should disengage himself from the [[thought]] of
death, or avoid fancying that it has us every moment by the throat?  what
matter is it, you will say, which way it comes to pass, provided a man
does not terrify himself with the expectation?  for my part, i am of this
mind, and if a [[man]] could by any means avoid it, though by creeping under
a calf’s skin, i am one that should not be ashamed of the shift; all i
aim at is, to pass my [[time]] at my ease, and the recreations that will most
contribute to it, i take hold of, as little glorious and exemplary as you
will:

              “praetulerim .  .  .  delirus inersque videri,
               dum mea delectent mala me, vel denique fallant,
               quam sapere, et ringi.”

     [“i had rather seem mad and a sluggard, so that my defects are
     agreeable to myself, or that i am not painfully conscious of them,
     than be [[wise]], and chaptious.”--hor., ep., ii. 2, 126.]

but ‘tis folly to [[think]] of doing anything that way.  they go, they come,
they gallop and dance, and not a word of [[death]].  all this is very fine;
but withal, when it comes either to themselves, their wives [[wife]], their
children, or [[friends]], surprising them at unawares and unprepared, then,
what torment, what outcries, what madness and despair!  did you ever see
anything so subdued, so changed, and so confounded?  a [[man]] must,
therefore, make more early provision for it; and this brutish negligence,
could it possibly lodge in the brain of any [[man]] of sense (which i think
utterly impossible), sells us its merchandise too dear.  were it an enemy
that could be avoided, i would then advise to borrow arms even of
cowardice itself; but seeing it is not, and that it will catch you as
well flying and playing the poltroon, as standing to’t like an honest
man:--

                   “nempe et fugacem persequitur virum,
                    nec parcit imbellis juventae
                    poplitibus timidoque tergo.”

     [“he pursues the flying poltroon, nor spares the hamstrings of the
     unwarlike [[youth]] who turns his back”--hor., ep., iii. 2, 14.]

and seeing that no temper of arms is of proof to secure us:--

              “ille licet ferro cautus, se condat et aere,
               mors tamen inclusum protrahet inde caput”

     [“let him hide beneath iron or brass in his [[fear]], [[death]] will pull
     his head out of his armour.”--propertious iii. 18]

--let us learn bravely to stand our ground, and [[fight]] him.  and to begin
to deprive him of the [[greatest]] advantage he has over us, let us take a
way quite contrary to the [[common]] course.  let us disarm him of his
novelty and strangeness, let us converse and be familiar with him, and
have nothing so frequent in our thoughts [[thought]] as [[death]].  upon all occasions
represent him to our [[imagination]] in his every shape; at the stumbling of
a horse, at the falling of a tile, at the least prick with a pin, let us
presently consider, and say to ourselves, “well, and what if it had been
death itself?”  and, thereupon, let us encourage and fortify ourselves.
let us evermore, amidst our jollity and feasting, set the remembrance of
our frail condition before our [[eyes]], never suffering ourselves to be so
far transported with our delights, but that we have some intervals of
reflecting upon, and considering how many several ways this jollity of
ours tends to [[death]], and with how many dangers it threatens it.  the
egyptians were wont to do after this manner, who in the height of their
feasting and mirth, caused a dried skeleton of a [[man]] to be brought into
the room to serve for a memento to their guests:

              “omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum
               grata superveniet, quae non sperabitur, hora.”

     [“think each day when [[past]] is thy [[last]]; the next day, as unexpected,
     will be the more welcome.”--hor., ep., i. 4, 13.]

where [[death]] waits for us is uncertain; let us look for him everywhere.
the premeditation of [[death]] is the premeditation of [[liberty]]; he who has
learned to [[die]] has unlearned to serve.  there is nothing [[evil]] in [[life]] for
him who rightly comprehends that the privation of [[life]] is no [[evil]]: to
know, how to [[die]] delivers us from all subjection and constraint.  paulus
emilius answered him whom the miserable [[king]] of macedon, his [[prisoner]],
sent to entreat him that he would not lead him in his triumph, “let him
make that request to himself.”--[ plutarch, [[life]] of paulus aemilius,
c. 17; cicero, tusc., v. 40.]

in [[truth]], in all things, if [[nature]] do not [[help]] a little, it is very hard
for art [[arts]] and industry to perform anything to [[purpose]].  i am in my own
nature not melancholic, but meditative; and there is nothing i have more
continually entertained myself withal than imaginations [[imagination]] of [[death]], even in
the most wanton [[time]] of my [[age]]:

               “jucundum quum aetas florida ver ageret.”

          [“when my florid [[age]] rejoiced in pleasant spring.”
            --catullus, lxviii.]

in the company of ladies [[lady]], and at games, some have perhaps [[thought]] me
possessed with some [[jealousy]], or the uncertainty of some [[hope]], whilst i
was entertaining myself with the remembrance of some one, surprised, a
few days before, with a burning fever of which he died, returning from an
entertainment like this, with his head full of idle fancies of [[love]] and
jollity, as mine was then, and that, for aught i knew, the same-destiny
was attending me.

          “jam fuerit, nec post unquam revocare licebit.”

     [“presently the [[present]] will have gone, never to be recalled.”
      lucretius, iii.  928.]

yet did not this [[thought]] wrinkle my forehead any more than any other.
it is impossible but we must [[feel]] a sting in such imaginations [[imagination]] as these,
at first; but with often turning and returning them in one’s [[mind]], they,
at [[last]], become so familiar as to be no trouble at all: otherwise, i, for
my part, should be in a perpetual fright and frenzy; for never [[man]] was so
distrustful of his [[life]], never [[man]] so uncertain as to its duration.
neither health, which i have hitherto ever enjoyed very [[strong]] and
vigorous, and very seldom interrupted, does prolong, nor sickness
contract my hopes [[hope]].  every minute, methinks, i am escaping, and it
eternally runs in my [[mind]], that what may be done to-morrow, may be done
to-day.  hazards and dangers do, in [[truth]], little or nothing hasten our
end; and if we consider how many thousands more remain and hang over our
heads, besides the accident that immediately threatens us, we shall find
that the sound and the sick, those that are abroad at sea, and those that
sit by the [[fire]], those who are engaged in [[battle]], and those who sit idle
at [[home]], are the one as near it as the other.

     “nemo altero fragilior est; nemo in crastinum sui certior.”

     [“no [[man]] is more fragile than another: no [[man]] more [[certain]] than
     another of to-morrow.”--seneca, ep., 91.]

for anything i have to do before i [[die]], the longest leisure would appear
too short, were it but an hour’s [[business]] i had to do.

a friend of mine the other day turning over my tablets, found therein a
memorandum of something i would have done after my decease, whereupon i
told him, as it was really true, that though i was no more than a
league’s distance only from my own house, and merry and well, yet when
that thing came into my head, i made haste to write it down there,
because i was not [[certain]] to [[live]] till i came [[home]].  as a [[man]] that am
eternally brooding over my own thoughts [[thought]], and confine them to my own
particular concerns, i am at all hours as well prepared as i am ever like
to be, and [[death]], whenever he shall come, can bring nothing along with
him i did not expect long before.  we should always, as near as we can,
be booted and spurred, and ready to go, and, above all things, take [[care]],
at that [[time]], to have no [[business]] with any one but one’s [[self]]:--

                   “quid brevi fortes jaculamur avo
                    multa?”

     [“why for so short a [[life]] tease ourselves with so many projects?”
       --hor., od., ii.  16, 17.]

for we shall there find [[work]] enough to do, without any need of addition.
one [[man]] complains, more than of [[death]], that he is thereby prevented of a
glorious [[victory]]; another, that he must [[die]] before he has [[married]] his
daughter, or educated his [[children]]; a third seems only troubled that he
must lose the [[society]] of his [[wife]]; a fourth, the conversation of his [[son]],
as the principal comfort and concern of his being.  for my part, i am,
thanks be to [[god]], at this instant in such a condition, that i am ready to
dislodge, whenever it shall please him, without regret for anything
whatsoever.  i disengage myself throughout from all worldly relations;
my leave is soon taken of all but myself.  never did any one prepare to
bid adieu to the [[world]] more absolutely and unreservedly, and to shake
hands with all manner of interest in it, than i expect to do.  the
deadest deaths [[death]] are the [[best]]:

                    “‘miser, o miser,’ aiunt, ‘omnia ademit
               una dies infesta mihi tot praemia vitae.’”

     [“‘wretch that i am,’ they cry, ‘one fatal day has deprived me of
     all joys of [[life]].’”--lucretius, iii. 911.]


and the builder,

              “manuet,” says he, “opera interrupta, minaeque
               murorum ingentes.”

     [“the works [[work]] remain incomplete, the tall pinnacles of the walls
     unmade.”--aeneid, iv.  88.]

a [[man]] must design nothing that will require so much [[time]] to the
finishing, or, at least, with no such passionate [[desire]] to see it brought
to [[perfection]].  we are born to action:

               “quum moriar, medium solvar et inter opus.”

     [“when i shall [[die]], let it be doing that i had designed.”
       --ovid, amor., ii.  10, 36.]

i would always have a [[man]] to be doing, and, as much as in him lies [[lie]], to
extend and spin out the offices of [[life]]; and then let [[death]] take me
planting my cabbages, indifferent to him, and still less of my gardens
not being finished.  i saw one [[die]], who, at his [[last]] gasp, complained of
nothing so much as that [[destiny]] was about to cut the thread of a
chronicle he was then compiling, when he was gone no farther than the
fifteenth or sixteenth of our kings [[king]]:

         “illud in his rebus non addunt: nec tibi earum
          jam desiderium rerum super insidet una.”

     [“they do not add, that dying, we have no longer a [[desire]] to possess
     things.”--lucretius, iii.  913.]

we are to discharge ourselves from these vulgar and hurtful humours [[humour]].
to this [[purpose]] it was that [[men]] first appointed the places of sepulture
adjoining the churches [[church]], and in the most frequented places of the [[city]], to
accustom, says lycurgus, the [[common]] [[people]], [[women]], and [[children]], that
they should not be startled at the sight of a corpse, and to the end,
that the continual spectacle of bones, graves, and [[funeral]] obsequies
should put us in [[mind]] of our frail condition:

              “quin etiam exhilarare viris convivia caede
               mos olim, et miscere epulis spectacula dira
               certantum ferro, saepe et super ipsa cadentum
               pocula, respersis non parco sanguine mensis.”

     [“it was formerly the custom to enliven banquets with slaughter, and
     to combine with the repast the dire spectacle of [[men]] contending with
     the [[sword]], the dying in many cases falling upon the cups, and
     covering the tables with [[blood]].”--silius italicus, xi. 51.]

and as the [[egyptians]] after their feasts were wont to [[present]] the company
with a [[great]] image of [[death]], by one that cried out to them, “drink and be
merry, for such shalt thou be when thou art [[arts]] dead”; so it is my custom to
have [[death]] not only in my [[imagination]], but continually in my mouth.
neither is there anything of which i am so inquisitive, and delight to
inform myself, as the manner of [[men’s]] deaths [[death]], their words, looks, and
bearing; nor any places in [[history]] i am so intent upon; and it is
manifest enough, by my crowding in examples [[example]] of this [[kind]], that i have a
particular fancy for that [[subject]].  if i were a writer of books [[book]], i would
compile a register, with a comment, of the various deaths [[death]] of [[men]]: he who
should [[teach]] [[men]] to [[die]] would at the same [[time]] [[teach]] them to [[live]].
dicarchus made one, to which he gave that title; but it was designed for
another and less profitable end.

peradventure, some one may object, that the [[pain]] and terror of dying so
infinitely exceed all manner of [[imagination]], that the [[best]] fencer will be
quite out of his play when it comes to the push.  let them say what they
will: to premeditate is doubtless a very [[great]] advantage; and besides, is
it nothing to go so far, at least, without disturbance or alteration?
moreover, [[nature]] herself assists and encourages us: if the [[death]] be
sudden and [[violent]], we have not leisure to [[fear]]; if otherwise, i perceive
that as i engage further in my disease, i naturally enter into a certain
loathing and disdain of [[life]].  i find i have much more ado to digest this
resolution of dying, when i am well in health, than when languishing of a
fever; and by how much i have less to do with the commodities of [[life]],
by [[reason]] that i begin to lose the use and [[pleasure]] of them, by so much i
look upon [[death]] with less terror.  which makes me [[hope]], that the further
i remove from the first, and the nearer i approach to the latter, i shall
the more easily exchange the one for the other.  and, as i have
experienced in other occurrences, that, as caesar says, things often
appear greater to us at distance than near at hand, i have found, that
being well, i have had maladies in much greater [[horror]] than when really
afflicted with them.  the vigour wherein i now am, the cheerfulness and
delight wherein i now [[live]], make the contrary estate appear in so [[great]] a
disproportion to my [[present]] condition, that, by [[imagination]], i magnify
those inconveniences by one-half, and apprehend them to be much more
troublesome, than i find them really to be, when they [[lie]] the most heavy
upon me; i [[hope]] to find [[death]] the same.

let us but observe in the ordinary changes [[change]] and declinations we daily
suffer, how [[nature]] deprives us of the [[light]] and sense of our bodily
decay.  what remains to an old [[man]] of the vigour of his [[youth]] and better
days?

               “heu! senibus vitae portio quanta manet.”

     [“alas, to old [[men]] what portion of [[life]] remains!”---maximian, vel
     pseudo-gallus, i. 16.]

caesar, to an old weather-beaten soldier of his guards, who came to ask
him leave that he might kill himself, taking notice of his withered body
and decrepit motion, pleasantly answered, “thou fanciest, then, that thou
art yet alive.”--[seneca, ep., 77.]--should a [[man]] fall into this
condition on the sudden, i do not [[think]] [[humanity]] capable of enduring such
a [[change]]: but [[nature]], leading us by the hand, an easy and, as it were, an
insensible pace, step by step conducts us to that miserable [[state]], and by
that means makes it familiar to us, so that we are insensible of the
stroke when our [[youth]] dies in us, though it be really a harder [[death]] than
the final dissolution of a languishing [[body]], than the [[death]] of old [[age]];
forasmuch as the fall is not so [[great]] from an uneasy being to none at
all, as it is from a sprightly and flourishing being to one that is
troublesome and painful.  the [[body]], bent and bowed, has less [[force]] to
support a burden; and it is the same with the [[soul]], and therefore it is,
that we are to raise her up firm and erect against the [[power]] of this
adversary.  for, as it is impossible she should ever be at rest, whilst
she stands in [[fear]] of it; so, if she once can assure herself, she may
boast (which is a thing as it were surpassing [[human]] condition) that it is
impossible that disquiet, [[anxiety]], or [[fear]], or any other disturbance,
should inhabit or have any place in her:

              “non vulnus instants tyranni
               mentha cadi solida, neque auster
               dux inquieti turbidus adriae,
               nec fulminantis magna jovis manus.”

     [“not the menacing look of a [[tyrant]] shakes her well-settled [[soul]],
     nor turbulent auster, the [[prince]] of the stormy adriatic, nor yet the
     [[strong]] hand of thundering jove, such a temper moves.”
      --hor., od., iii.  3, 3.]

she is then become [[sovereign]] of all her lusts and [[passions]], mistress of
necessity, shame, [[poverty]], and all the other injuries of [[fortune]].  let
us, therefore, as many of us as can, get this advantage; ‘tis the true
and [[sovereign]] [[liberty]] here on [[earth]], that fortifies us wherewithal to
defy [[violence]] and [[injustice]], and to contemn prisons and chains:

                              “in manicis et
               compedibus saevo te sub custode tenebo.
               ipse deus, simul atque volam, me solvet.  opinor,
               hoc sentit; moriar; mors ultima linea rerum est.”

          [“i will keep thee in fetters and chains, in custody of a
          savage keeper.--a [[god]] will when i ask him, set me [[free]].
          this [[god]] i [[think]] is [[death]].  [[death]] is the term of all things.”
           --hor., ep., i.  16, 76.]

our very [[religion]] itself has no surer [[human]] foundation than the contempt
of [[life]].  not only the argument of [[reason]] invites us to it--for why
should we [[fear]] to lose a thing, which being lost, cannot be lamented?
--but, also, seeing we are threatened by so many sorts of [[death]], is it not
infinitely worse eternally to [[fear]] them all, than once to undergo one of
them?  and what matters it, when it shall happen, since it is inevitable?
to him that told [[socrates]], “the thirty tyrants [[tyrant]] have sentenced thee to
death”; “and [[nature]] them,” said he.--[socrates was not condemned to death
by the thirty tyrants [[tyrant]], but by the athenians.-diogenes laertius, ii.35.]--
what a ridiculous thing it is to trouble ourselves about taking the only
step that is to deliver us from all trouble!  as our birth brought us the
birth of all things, so in our [[death]] is the [[death]] of all things included.
and therefore to lament that we shall not be alive a hundred years hence,
is the same folly as to be [[sorry]] we were not alive a hundred years ago.
death is the beginning of another [[life]].  so did we weep, and so much it
cost us to enter into this, and so did we put off our former veil in
entering into it.  nothing can be a grievance that is but once.  is it
reasonable so long to [[fear]] a thing that will so soon be despatched?
long [[life]], and short, are by [[death]] made all one; for there is no long,
nor short, to things that are no more.  [[aristotle]] tells us that there are
certain little beasts upon the banks of the river hypanis, that never
live above a day: they which [[die]] at eight of the clock in the morning,
die in their [[youth]], and those that [[die]] at five in the evening, in their
decrepitude: which of us would not laugh to see this moment of
continuance put into the consideration of weal or woe?  the most and the
least, of ours, in comparison with eternity, or yet with the duration of
mountains, rivers, stars, trees, and even of some animals, is no less
ridiculous.--[ seneca, consol. ad marciam, c. 20.]

but [[nature]] compels us to it.  “go out of this [[world]],” says she, “as you
entered into it; the same pass you made from [[death]] to [[life]], without
passion or [[fear]], the same, after the same manner, repeat from [[life]] to
death.  your [[death]] is a part of the order of the [[universe]], ‘tis a part of
the [[life]] of the [[world]].

                    “inter se mortales mutua vivunt
                    ................................
                    et, quasi cursores, vitai lampada tradunt.”

     [“mortals, amongst themselves, [[live]] by turns, and, like the runners
     in the games, give up the lamp, when they have won the [[race]], to the
     next comer.--” lucretius, ii.  75, 78.]

“shall i exchange for you this beautiful contexture of things?  ‘tis the
condition of your creation; [[death]] is a part of you, and whilst you
endeavour to evade it, you evade yourselves.  this very being of yours
that you now enjoy is equally divided betwixt [[life]] and [[death]].  the day of
your birth is one day’s advance towards the grave:

          “prima, qux vitam dedit, hora carpsit.”

     [“the first hour that gave us [[life]] took away also an hour.”
      --seneca, her.  fur., 3 chor.  874.]

          “nascentes morimur, finisque ab origine pendet.”

     [“as we are born we [[die]], and the end commences with the beginning.”
       --manilius, ast., iv.  16.]

“all the whole [[time]] you [[live]], you purloin from [[life]] and [[live]] at the
expense of [[life]] itself.  the perpetual [[work]] of your [[life]] is but to lay
the foundation of [[death]].  you are in [[death]], whilst you are in [[life]],
because you still are after [[death]], when you are no more alive; or, if you
had rather have it so, you are [[dead]] after [[life]], but dying all the while
you [[live]]; and [[death]] handles the dying much more rudely than the [[dead]], and
more sensibly and essentially.  if you have made your [[profit]] of [[life]], you
have had enough of it; go your way satisfied.

               “cur non ut plenus vita; conviva recedis?”

     [“why not depart from [[life]] as a sated guest from a feast?
     “lucretius, iii.  951.]

“if you have not known how to make the [[best]] use of it, if it was
unprofitable to you, what need you [[care]] to lose it, to what end would you
desire longer to keep it?

               “‘cur amplius addere quaeris,
          rursum quod pereat male, et ingratum occidat omne?’

     [“why seek to add longer [[life]], merely to renew ill-spent [[time]], and
     be again tormented?”--lucretius, iii. 914.]

“life in itself is neither [[good]] nor [[evil]]; it is the scene of [[good]] or evil
as you make it.’ and, if you have lived a day, you have seen all: one day
is [[equal]] and like to all other days.  there is no other [[light]], no other
shade; this very sun, this moon, these very stars, this very order and
disposition of things, is the same your [[ancestors]] enjoyed, and that shall
also entertain your [[posterity]]:

               “‘non alium videre patres, aliumve nepotes
               aspicient.’

     [“your grandsires saw no other thing; nor will your [[posterity]].”
      --manilius, i. 529.]

“and, come the worst that can come, the distribution and variety of all
the acts of my comedy are performed in a year.  if you have observed the
revolution of my four seasons, they comprehend the infancy, the [[youth]],
the virility, and the old [[age]] of the [[world]]: the year has played his part,
and knows [[know]] no other art [[arts]] but to begin again; it will always be the same
thing:

               “‘versamur ibidem, atque insumus usque.’

     [“we are turning in the same circle, ever therein confined.”
      --lucretius, iii. 1093.]

               “‘atque in se sua per vestigia volvitur annus.’

     [“the year is ever turning around in the same footsteps.”
      --virgil, georg., ii. 402.]

“i am not prepared to create for you any new recreations:

             “‘nam tibi prxterea quod machiner, inveniamque
               quod placeat, nihil est; eadem sunt omnia semper.’

     [“i can devise, nor find anything else to please you: ‘tis the same
     thing over and over again.”--lucretius iii. 957]

“give place to others, as others have given place to you.  equality is
the [[soul]] of equity.  who can [[complain]] of being comprehended in the same
destiny, wherein all are involved?  besides, [[live]] as long as you can, you
shall by that nothing shorten the space you are to be [[dead]]; ‘tis all to
no [[purpose]]; you shall be every whit as long in the condition you so much
fear, as if you had died at nurse:

               “‘licet quot vis vivendo vincere secla,
          mors aeterna tamen nihilominus illa manebit.’

     [“live triumphing over as many ages [[age]] as you will, [[death]] still will
     remain eternal.”--lucretius, iii. 1103]

“and yet i will place you in such a condition as you shall have no reason
to be displeased.

          “‘in vera nescis nullum fore morte alium te,
          qui possit vivus tibi to lugere peremptum,
          stansque jacentem.’

     [“know you not that, when [[dead]], there can be no other living [[self]] to
     lament you [[dead]], standing on your grave.”--idem., ibid., 898.]

“nor shall you so much as [[wish]] for the [[life]] you are so concerned about:

          “‘nec sibi enim quisquam tum se vitamque requirit.
          ..................................................
          “‘nec desiderium nostri nos afficit ullum.’

“death is less to be feared than nothing, if there could be anything less
than nothing.

        “‘multo .  .  .  mortem minus ad nos esse putandium,
          si minus esse potest, quam quod nihil esse videmus.’

“neither can it any way concern you, whether you are living or [[dead]]:
living, by [[reason]] that you are still in being; [[dead]], because you are no
more.  moreover, no one dies before his hour: the [[time]] you leave behind
was no more yours than that was lapsed and gone before you came into the
world; nor does it any more concern you.

         “‘respice enim, quam nil ad nos anteacta vetustas
          temporis aeterni fuerit.’

     [“consider how as nothing to us is the old [[age]] of times [[time]] [[past]].”
      --lucretius iii. 985]

wherever your [[life]] ends, it is all there.  the utility of living consists
not in the length of days, but in the use of [[time]]; a [[man]] may have lived
long, and yet lived but a little.  make use of [[time]] while it is present
with you.  it depends upon your will, and not upon the number of days, to
have a sufficient length of [[life]].  is it possible you can imagine never
to arrive at the place towards which you are continually going? and yet
there is no [[journey]] but hath its end.  and, if company will make it more
pleasant or more easy to you, does not all the [[world]] go the self-same
way?

          “‘omnia te, vita perfuncta, sequentur.’

          [“all things, then, [[life]] over, must [[follow]] thee.”
           --lucretius, iii.  981.]

“does not all the [[world]] dance the same brawl that you do?  is there
anything that does not grow old, as well as you?  a thousand [[men]], a
thousand animals, a thousand other creatures, [[die]] at the same moment that
you [[die]]:

        “‘nam nox nulla diem, neque noctem aurora sequuta est,
          quae non audierit mistos vagitibus aegris
          ploratus, mortis comites et funeris atri.’

     [“no night has followed day, no day has followed night, in which
     there has not been heard sobs and sorrowing cries, the companions of
     [[death]] and funerals.”--lucretius, v.  579.]

“to what end should you endeavour to draw back, if there be no
possibility to evade it? you have seen examples [[example]] enough of those who have
been well pleased to [[die]], as thereby delivered from heavy miseries; but
have you ever found any who have been dissatisfied with dying?  it must,
therefore, needs be very foolish to condemn a thing you have neither
experimented in your own [[person]], nor by that of any other.  why dost thou
complain of me and of [[destiny]]?  do we do thee any [[wrong]]?  is it for thee
to govern us, or for us to govern thee?  though, peradventure, thy age
may not be accomplished, yet thy [[life]] is: a [[man]] of low stature is as much
a [[man]] as a giant; neither [[men]] nor their lives [[life]] are measured by the ell.
chiron refused to be [[immortal]], when he was acquainted with the conditions
under which he was to enjoy it, by the [[god]] of [[time]] itself and its
duration, his [[father]] saturn.  do but seriously consider how much more
insupportable and painful an [[immortal]] [[life]] would be to [[man]] than what i
have already given him.  if you had not [[death]], you would eternally curse
me for having deprived you of it; i have mixed a little bitterness with
it, to the end, that seeing of what convenience it is, you might not too
greedily and indiscreetly seek and embrace it: and that you might be so
established in this moderation, as neither to nauseate [[life]], nor have any
antipathy for dying, which i have decreed you shall once do, i have
tempered the one and the other betwixt [[pleasure]] and [[pain]].  it was i that
taught thales, the most eminent of your sages, that to [[live]] and to die
were indifferent; which made him, very wisely, [[answer]] him, ‘why then he
did not [[die]]?’  ‘because,’ said he, ‘it is indifferent.’--[diogenes
laertius, i.  35.]--water, [[earth]], air, and [[fire]], and the other parts of
this creation of mine, are no more instruments of thy [[life]] than they are
of thy [[death]].  why dost thou [[fear]] thy [[last]] day? it contributes no more to
thy dissolution, than every one of the rest: the [[last]] step is not the
cause of lassitude: it does not confess it.  every day travels towards
death; the [[last]] only arrives at it.”  these are the [[good]] lessons our
mother [[nature]] teaches [[teach]].

i have often considered with myself whence it should proceed, that in war
the image of [[death]], whether we look upon it in ourselves or in others,
should, without comparison, appear less dreadful than at [[home]] in our own
houses (for if it were not so, it would be an [[army]] of doctors and whining
milksops), and that being still in all places the same, there should be,
notwithstanding, much more assurance in peasants and the meaner sort of
people, than in others of [[better]] quality.  i [[believe]], in [[truth]], that it
is those terrible ceremonies [[ceremony]] and preparations wherewith we set it out,
that more terrify us than the thing itself; a new, quite contrary way of
living; the cries of mothers [[mother]], wives [[wife]], and [[children]]; the visits of
astounded and afflicted [[friends]]; the attendance of pale and blubbering
servants; a dark room, set round with burning tapers; our beds environed
with physicians and divines; in sum, nothing but ghostliness and horror
round about us; we seem [[dead]] and buried already.  [[children]] are afraid
even of those they are [[best]] acquainted with, when disguised in a visor;
and so ‘tis with us; the visor must be removed as well from things as
from persons [[person]], that being taken away, we shall find nothing underneath but
the very same [[death]] that a mean servant or a [[poor]] chambermaid died a day
or two ago, without any manner of apprehension.  [[happy]] is the [[death]] that
deprives us of leisure for preparing such ceremonials.




chapter xx

of the [[force]] of imagination

            “fortis imaginatio generat casum,” say the schoolmen.

     [“a [[strong]] [[imagination]] begets the event itself.”--axiom. scholast.]

i am one of those who are most sensible of the [[power]] of [[imagination]]:
every one is jostled by it, but some are overthrown by it.  it has a very
piercing impression upon me; and i make it my [[business]] to avoid, wanting
force to resist it.  i could [[live]] by the sole [[help]] of healthful and jolly
company: the very sight of another’s [[pain]] materially pains [[pain]] me, and i
often usurp the sensations of another [[person]].  a perpetual cough in
another tickles my lungs and throat.  i more unwillingly visit the sick
in whom by [[love]] and [[duty]] i am interested, than those i [[care]] not for, to
whom i less look.  i take possession of the disease i am concerned at,
and take it to myself.  i do not at all wonder that fancy should give
fevers and sometimes kill such as allow it too much scope, and are too
willing to entertain it.  simon thomas was a [[great]] physician of his [[time]]:
i [[remember]], that happening one day at toulouse to meet him at a [[rich]] old
fellow’s house, who was troubled with [[weak]] lungs, and discoursing with
the patient about the method of his cure, he told him, that one thing
which would be very conducive to it, was to give me such [[occasion]] to be
pleased with his company, that i might come often to see him, by which
means, and by fixing his [[eyes]] upon the freshness of my [[complexion]], and
his [[imagination]] upon the sprightliness and vigour that glowed in my
youth, and possessing all his senses with the flourishing [[age]] wherein i
then was, his habit of [[body]] might, peradventure, be amended; but he
forgot to say that mine, at the same [[time]], might be made worse.  gallus
vibius so much bent his [[mind]] to find out the essence and motions of
madness, that, in the end, he himself went out of his wits, and to such a
degree, that he could never after recover his [[judgment]], and might brag
that he was become a [[fool]] by too much [[wisdom]].  some there are who through
fear anticipate the hangman; and there was the [[man]], whose [[eyes]] being
unbound to have his pardon [[read]] to him, was found stark [[dead]] upon the
scaffold, by the stroke of [[imagination]].  we start, tremble, turn pale,
and blush, as we are variously moved by [[imagination]]; and, being a-bed,
feel our bodies [[body]] agitated with its [[power]] to that [[degree]], as even sometimes
to expiring.  and boiling [[youth]], when fast asleep, grows so warm with
fancy, as in a [[dream]] to satisfy amorous desires [[desire]]:--

         “ut, quasi transactis saepe omnibu rebu, profundant
          fluminis ingentes, fluctus, vestemque cruentent.”

although it be no new thing to see horns grown in a night on the forehead
of one that had none when he went to bed, notwithstanding, what befell
cippus, [[king]] of [[italy]],  is memorable; who having one day been a very
delighted spectator of a bullfight, and having all the night dreamed that
he had horns on his head, did, by the [[force]] of [[imagination]], really cause
them to grow there.  passion gave to the [[son]] of croesus the voice which
nature had denied him.  and antiochus fell into a fever, inflamed with
the [[beauty]] of stratonice, too deeply imprinted in his [[soul]].  pliny
pretends to have seen lucius cossitius, who from a woman was turned into
a [[man]] upon her very wedding-day.  pontanus and others report the like
metamorphosis to have happened in these latter days in [[italy]].  and,
through the vehement [[desire]] of him and his [[mother]]:

          “volta puer solvit, quae foemina voverat, iphis.”

myself passing by vitry le francois,  saw a [[man]] the bishop of soissons
had, in confirmation, called germain, whom all the inhabitants of the
place had known to be a girl till two-and-twenty years of [[age]], called
mary.  he was, at the [[time]] of my being there, very full of beard, old,
and not [[married]].  he told us, that by straining himself in a leap his
male organs came out; and the girls of that place have, to this day, a
song, wherein they advise one another not to take too [[great]] strides, for
fear of being turned into [[men]], as [[mary]] germain was.  it is no wonder if
this sort of accident frequently happen; for if [[imagination]] have any
power in such things, it is so continually and vigorously bent upon this
subject, that to the end it may not so often relapse into the same
thought and [[violence]] of [[desire]], it were [[better]], once for all, to give
these [[young]] wenches the things they long for.

some attribute the scars of [[king]] dagobert and of st. francis to the force
of [[imagination]].  it is said, that by it bodies [[body]] will sometimes be removed
from their places; and celsus tells us of a [[priest]] whose [[soul]] would be
ravished into such an ecstasy that the [[body]] would, for a long [[time]],
remain without sense or respiration.  st. augustine makes mention of
another, who, upon the hearing of any lamentable or doleful cries, would
presently fall into a swoon, and be so far out of himself, that it was in
vain to call, bawl in his ears, pinch or burn him, till he voluntarily
came to himself; and then he would say, that he had heard voices as it
were afar off, and did [[feel]] when they pinched and burned him; and, to
prove that this was no obstinate dissimulation in defiance of his sense
of feeling, it was manifest, that all the while he had neither pulse nor
breathing.

‘tis very probable, that visions, enchantments, and all extraordinary
effects of that [[nature]], derive their credit principally from the [[power]] of
imagination, working and making its chiefest impression upon vulgar and
more easy souls [[soul]], whose [[belief]] is so strangely imposed upon, as to think
they see what they do not see.

i am not satisfied whether those pleasant ligatures--[les nouements
d’aiguillettes, as they were called, knots tied by some one, at a
wedding, on a strip of leather, cotton, or silk, and which, especially
when passed through the wedding-ring, were supposed to have the magical
effect of preventing a consummation of the [[marriage]] until they were
untied.  see louandre, la sorcellerie, 1853, p. 73.  the same
superstition and appliance existed in [[england]].]--with which this [[age]] of
ours is so occupied, that there is almost no other talk, are not mere
voluntary impressions of apprehension and [[fear]]; for i [[know]], by
experience, in the case of a particular friend of mine, one for whom i
can be as responsible as for myself, and a [[man]] that cannot possibly fall
under any manner of suspicion of insufficiency, and as little of being
enchanted, who having heard a companion of his make a relation of an
unusual frigidity that surprised him at a very unseasonable [[time]]; being
afterwards himself engaged upon the same account, the [[horror]] of the
former story on a sudden so strangely possessed his [[imagination]], that he
ran the same [[fortune]] the other had done; and from that [[time]] forward, the
scurvy remembrance of his disaster running in his [[mind]] and tyrannising
over him, he was [[subject]] to relapse into the same misfortune.  he found
some remedy, however, for this fancy in another fancy, by himself frankly
confessing and declaring beforehand to the party with whom he was to have
to do, this subjection of his, by which means, the agitation of his soul
was, in some sort, appeased; and knowing that, now, some such
misbehaviour was expected from him, the restraint upon his faculties grew
less.  and afterwards, at such times [[time]] as he was in no such apprehension,
when setting about the act (his thoughts [[thought]] being then disengaged and [[free]],
and his [[body]] in its true and [[natural]] estate) he was at leisure to cause
the part to be handled and communicated to the [[knowledge]] of the other
party, he was totally freed from that vexatious infirmity.  after a man
has once done a woman [[right]], he is never after in danger of misbehaving
himself with that [[person]], unless upon the account of some excusable
weakness.  neither is this disaster to be feared, but in adventures,
where the [[soul]] is overextended with [[desire]] or [[respect]], and, especially,
where the opportunity is of an unforeseen and pressing [[nature]]; in those
cases, there is no means for a [[man]] to defend himself from such a
surprise, as shall put him altogether out of sorts.  i have known some,
who have secured themselves from this mischance, by coming half sated
elsewhere, purposely to abate the ardour of the fury, and others, who,
being grown old, find themselves less impotent by being less able; and
one, who found an advantage in being assured by a friend of his, that he
had a counter-charm of enchantments that would secure him from this
disgrace.  the story itself is not, much amiss, and therefore you shall
have it.

a count of a very [[great]] [[family]], and with whom i was very intimate, being
married to a [[fair]] [[lady]], who had formerly been courted by one who was at
the wedding, all his [[friends]] were in very [[great]] [[fear]]; but especially an
old [[lady]] his kinswoman, who had the ordering of the solemnity, and in
whose house it was kept, suspecting his rival would offer foul play by
these sorceries.  which [[fear]] she communicated to me.  i bade her rely
upon me: i had, by [[chance]], about me a [[certain]] flat plate of gold, whereon
were graven some celestial figures, supposed [[good]] against sunstroke or
pains in the head, being applied to the suture: where, that it might the
better remain firm, it was sewed to a ribbon to be tied under the chin; a
foppery cousin-german to this of which i am speaking.  jaques pelletier,
who lived in my house, had presented this to me for a singular rarity.
i had a fancy to make some use of this knack, and therefore privately
told the count, that he might possibly run the same [[fortune]] other
bridegrooms had sometimes done, especially some one being in the house,
who, no [[doubt]], would be glad to do him such a courtesy: but let him
boldly go to bed.  for i would do him the office of a friend, and, if
need were, would not spare a miracle it was in my [[power]] to do, provided
he would engage to me, upon his [[honour]], to keep it to himself; and only,
when they came to bring him his caudle,--[a custom in [[france]] to bring the
bridegroom a caudle in the middle of the night on his wedding-night]--
if matters had not gone well with him, to give me such a sign, and leave
the rest to me.  now he had had his ears so battered, and his [[mind]] so
prepossessed with the eternal tattle of this [[business]], that when he came
to’t, he did really find himself tied with the trouble of his
imagination, and, accordingly, at the [[time]] appointed, gave me the sign.
whereupon, i whispered him in the ear, that he should rise, under
pretence of putting us out of the room, and after a jesting manner pull
my nightgown from my shoulders--we were of much about the same height--
throw it over his own, and there keep it till he had performed what i had
appointed him to do, which was, that when we were all gone out of the
chamber, he should withdraw to make water, should three times [[time]] repeat such
and such words, and as often do such and such actions; that at every of
the three times [[time]], he should tie the ribbon i put into his hand about his
middle, and be sure to place the medal that was fastened to it, the
figures in such a posture, exactly upon his reins, which being done, and
having the [[last]] of the three times [[time]] so well girt and fast tied the ribbon
that it could neither untie nor slip from its place, let him confidently
return to his [[business]], and withal not forget to spread my gown upon the
bed, so that it might be sure to cover them both.  these ape’s tricks are
the main of the effect, our fancy being so far seduced as to [[believe]] that
such [[strange]] means must, of necessity, proceed from some abstruse
science: their very inanity gives them weight and reverence.  and,
certain it is, that my figures approved themselves more venereal than
solar, more active than prohibitive.  ‘twas a sudden whimsey, mixed with
a little curiosity, that made me do a thing so contrary to my [[nature]]; for
i am an [[enemy]] to all subtle and counterfeit actions, and abominate all
manner of trickery, though it be for [[sport]], and to an advantage; for
though the action may not be vicious in itself, its mode is vicious.

amasis, [[king]] of [[egypt]], having [[married]] laodice, a very beautiful greek
virgin, though noted for his abilities elsewhere, found himself quite
another [[man]] with his [[wife]], and could by no means enjoy her; at which he
was so enraged, that he threatened to kill her, suspecting her to be a
witch.  as ‘tis usual in things that consist in fancy, she put him upon
devotion, and having accordingly made his vows to [[venus]], he found himself
divinely restored the very first night after his oblations and
sacrifices.  now [[women]] are to blame to entertain us with that disdainful,
coy, and angry countenance, which extinguishes our vigour, as it kindles
our [[desire]]; which made the daughter-in-law of pythagoras--[theano, the
lady in [[question]] was the [[wife]], not the daughter-in-law of pythagoras.]--
say, “that the woman who goes to bed to a [[man]], must put off her modesty
with her petticoat, and put it on again with the same.”  the [[soul]] of the
assailant, being disturbed with many several alarms, readily loses the
power of performance; and whoever the [[imagination]] has once put this trick
upon, and confounded with the shame of it (and she never does it but at
the first acquaintance, by [[reason]] [[men]] are then more ardent and eager, and
also, at this first account a [[man]] gives of himself, he is much more
timorous of miscarrying), having made an ill beginning, he enters into
such fever and despite at the accident, as are apt to remain and continue
with him upon following occasions [[occasion]].

married [[people]], having all their [[time]] before them, ought never to compel
or so much as to offer at the feat, if they do not find themselves quite
ready: and it is less unseemly to fail of handselling the nuptial sheets,
when a [[man]] perceives himself full of agitation and trembling, and to
await another opportunity at more private and more composed leisure, than
to make himself perpetually miserable, for having misbehaved himself and
been baffled at the first assault.  till possession be taken, a [[man]] that
knows himself [[subject]] to this infirmity, should leisurely and by degrees
make several little trials and [[light]] offers, without obstinately
attempting at once, to [[force]] an absolute [[conquest]] over his own mutinous
and indisposed faculties.  such as [[know]] their members to be naturally
obedient, need take no other [[care]] but only to counterplot their
fantasies.

the indocile [[liberty]] of this member is very remarkable, so importunately
unruly in its tumidity and [[impatience]], when we do not require it, and so
unseasonably disobedient, when we stand most in need of it: so
imperiously contesting in [[authority]] with the will, and with so much
haughty obstinacy denying all solicitation, both of hand and [[mind]].  and
yet, though his rebellion is so universally complained of, and that proof
is thence deduced to condemn him, if he had, nevertheless, feed me
to plead his cause, i should peradventure, bring the rest of his
fellow-members into suspicion of complotting this mischief against him,
out of pure envy at the importance and [[pleasure]] especial to his
employment; and to have, by confederacy, armed the whole [[world]] against
him, by malevolently charging him alone, with their [[common]] offence.  for
let any one consider, whether there is any one part of our bodies [[body]] that
does not often refuse to perform its office at the precept of the will,
and that does not often exercise its function in defiance of her command.
they have every one of them [[passions]] of their own, that rouse and awaken,
stupefy and benumb them, without our leave or [[consent]].  how often do the
involuntary motions of the countenance discover our inward thoughts [[thought]], and
betray our most private secrets to the bystanders.  the same cause that
animates this member, does also, without our [[knowledge]], animate the
lungs, pulse, and [[heart]], the sight of a pleasing object imperceptibly
diffusing a flame through all our parts, with a feverish motion.  is
there nothing but these veins and muscles that swell and flag without the
consent, not only of the will, but even of our [[knowledge]] also?  we do not
command our hairs to stand on end, nor our skin to shiver either with
fear or [[desire]]; the hands often convey themselves to parts to which we do
not direct them; the tongue will be interdict, and the voice congealed,
when we [[know]] not how to [[help]] it.  when we have nothing to [[eat]], and would
willingly forbid it, the appetite does not, for all that, forbear to stir
up the parts that are [[subject]] to it, no more nor less than the other
appetite we were speaking of, and in like manner, as unseasonably leaves
us, when it thinks [[think]] fit.  the vessels that serve to discharge the belly
have their own proper dilatations and compressions, without and beyond
our concurrence, as well as those which are destined to purge the reins;
and that which, to justify the prerogative of the will, st. augustine
urges, of having seen a [[man]] who could command his rear to discharge as
often together as he pleased, vives, his commentator, yet further
fortifies with another [[example]] in his [[time]],--of one that could break wind
in tune; but these cases do not suppose any more pure [[obedience]] in that
part; for is anything commonly more tumultuary or indiscreet?  to which
let me add, that i myself knew one so rude and ungoverned, as for forty
years together made his master vent with one continued and unintermitted
outbursting, and ‘tis like will do so till he [[die]] of it.  and i could
heartily [[wish]], that i only knew by reading, how often a man’s belly, by
the denial of one [[single]] puff, brings him to the very door of an
exceeding painful [[death]]; and that the [[emperor]],--[the [[emperor]] claudius,
who, however, according to suetonius (vita, c. 32), only intended to
authorise this singular [[privilege]] by an edict.]--who gave [[liberty]] to let
fly in all places, had, at the same [[time]], given us [[power]] to do it.  but
for our will, in whose behalf we prefer this accusation, with how much
greater probability may we reproach herself with mutiny and sedition, for
her irregularity and disobedience?  does she always will what we would
have her to do?  does she not often will what we forbid her to will, and
that to our manifest prejudice?  does she suffer herself, more than any
of the rest, to be governed and directed by the results of our [[reason]]? to
conclude, i should move, in the behalf of the gentleman, my client, it
might be considered, that in this [[fact]], his cause being inseparably and
indistinctly conjoined with an accessory, yet he only is called in
question, and that by arguments and accusations, which cannot be charged
upon the other; whose [[business]], indeed, it is sometimes inopportunely to
invite, but never to refuse, and invite, moreover, after a tacit and
quiet manner; and therefore is the malice and [[injustice]] of his accusers
most manifestly apparent.  but be it how it will, protesting against the
proceedings of the advocates and judges [[judge]], [[nature]] will, in the meantime,
proceed after her own way, who had done but well, had she endowed this
member with some particular [[privilege]]; the author of the sole immortal
work of mortals; a [[divine]] [[work]], according to [[socrates]]; and [[love]], the
desire of immortality, and himself an [[immortal]] demon.

some one, perhaps, by such an effect of [[imagination]] may have had the good
luck to leave behind him here, the scrofula, which his companion who has
come after, has carried with him into [[spain]].  and ‘tis for this reason
you may see why [[men]] in such cases require a [[mind]] prepared for the thing
that is to be done.  why do the physicians possess, before hand, their
patients’ credulity with so many false promises of cure, if not to the
end, that the effect of [[imagination]] may supply the imposture of their
decoctions?  they [[know]] very well, that a [[great]] master of their [[trade]] has
given it under his hand, that he has known some with whom the very sight
of physic would [[work]].  all which conceits come now into my head, by the
remembrance of a story was told me by a domestic apothecary of my
father’s, a blunt swiss, a nation not much addicted to vanity and lying,
of a merchant he had long known at toulouse, who being a valetudinary,
and much afflicted with the stone, had often [[occasion]] to take clysters,
of which he caused several sorts to be prescribed him by the physicians,
acccording to the accidents of his disease; which, being brought him, and
none of the usual forms, as feeling if it were not too hot, and the like,
being omitted, he lay down, the syringe advanced, and all ceremonies
performed, injection alone excepted; after which, the apothecary being
gone, and the patient accommodated as if he had really received a
clyster, he found the same operation and effect that those do who have
taken one indeed; and if at any [[time]] the physician did not find the
operation sufficient, he would usually give him two or three more doses,
after the same manner.  and the fellow swore, that to save charges (for
he paid as if he had really taken them) this sick man’s [[wife]], having
sometimes made [[trial]] of warm water only, the effect discovered the [[cheat]],
and finding these would do no [[good]], was fain to return to the old way.

a woman fancying she had swallowed a pin in a piece of bread, cried and
lamented as though she had an intolerable [[pain]] in her throat, where she
thought she [[felt]] it stick; but an ingenious fellow that was brought to
her, seeing no outward tumour nor alteration, supposing it to be only a
conceit taken at some crust of bread that had hurt her as it went down,
caused her to vomit, and, unseen, threw a crooked pin into the basin,
which the woman no sooner saw, but believing she had cast it up, she
presently found herself eased of her [[pain]].  i myself knew a gentleman,
who having treated a large company at his house, three or four days after
bragged in jest (for there was no such thing), that he had made them eat
of a baked cat; at which, a [[young]] gentlewoman, who had been at the feast,
took such a [[horror]], that falling into a [[violent]] vomiting and fever, there
was no possible means to save her.  even brute beasts are [[subject]] to the
force of [[imagination]] as well as we; witness dogs, who [[die]] of [[grief]] for
the loss of their masters; and bark and tremble and start in their sleep;
so horses will kick and whinny in their sleep.

now all this may be attributed to the close affinity and relation betwixt
the [[soul]] and the [[body]] intercommunicating their fortunes [[fortune]]; but ‘tis quite
another thing when the [[imagination]] works [[work]] not only upon one’s own
particular [[body]], but upon that of others also.  and as an infected body
communicates its malady to those that approach or [[live]] near it, as we see
in the plague, the smallpox, and sore [[eyes]], that run through whole
families and cities [[city]]:--

          “dum spectant oculi laesos, laeduntur et ipsi;
          multaque corporibus transitione nocent.”

     [“when we look at [[people]] with sore [[eyes]], our own [[eyes]] become sore.
     many things are hurtful to our bodies [[body]] by transition.”
      --ovid, de rem. amor., 615.]

--so the [[imagination]], being vehemently agitated, darts out infection
capable of offending the [[foreign]] object.  the ancients had an [[opinion]] of
certain [[women]] of scythia, that being animated and enraged against any
one, they killed him only with their looks.  tortoises and ostriches
hatch their eggs with only looking on them, which infers that their eyes
have in them some ejaculative [[virtue]].  and the [[eyes]] of witches are said
to be assailant and hurtful:--

          “nescio quis teneros oculus mihi fascinat agnos.”

     [“some eye, i [[know]] not whose is bewitching my tender lambs.”
      --virgil, eclog., iii.  103.]

magicians are no very [[good]] [[authority]] with me.  but we experimentally see
that [[women]] impart the marks of their fancy to the [[children]] they carry in
the womb; witness her that was brought to bed of a moor; and there was
presented to charles the [[emperor]] and [[king]] of bohemia, a girl from about
pisa, all over rough and covered with hair, whom her [[mother]] said to be so
conceived by [[reason]] of a picture of st. john the baptist, that hung
within the curtains of her bed.

it is the same with beasts; witness jacob’s sheep, and the hares and
partridges that the snow turns [[white]] upon the mountains.  there was at my
house, a little while ago, a cat seen watching a bird upon the top of a
tree: these, for some [[time]], mutually fixing their [[eyes]] one upon another,
the bird at [[last]] let herself fall [[dead]] into the cat’s claws, either
dazzled by the [[force]] of its own [[imagination]], or drawn by some attractive
power of the cat.  such as are addicted to the pleasures [[pleasure]] of the field,
have, i make no [[question]], heard the story of the falconer, who having
earnestly fixed his [[eyes]] upon a kite in the air; laid a wager that he
would bring her down with the sole [[power]] of his sight, and did so, as it
was said; for the tales i borrow i charge upon the consciences of those
from whom i have them.  the discourses are my own, and found themselves
upon the proofs of [[reason]], not of [[experience]]; to which every one has
liberty to add his own examples [[example]]; and who has none, let him not forbear,
the number and varieties of accidents considered, to [[believe]] that there
are plenty of them; if i do not apply them well, let some other do it for
me.  and, also, in the [[subject]] of which i treat, our manners and motions,
testimonies and instances; how fabulous soever, provided they are
possible, serve as well as the true; whether they have really happened or
no, at [[rome]] or [[paris]], to john or peter, ‘tis still within the verge of
human capacity, which serves me to [[good]] use.  i see, and make my
advantage of it, as well in shadow as in substance; and amongst the
various readings thereof in [[history]], i cull out the most rare and
memorable to fit my own turn.  there are authors whose only end and
design it is to give an account of things that have happened; mine, if i
could arrive unto it, should be to deliver of what may happen.  there is
a just [[liberty]] allowed in the schools, of supposing similitudes, when
they have none at hand.  i do not, however, make any use of that
privilege, and as to that matter, in [[superstitious]] [[religion]], surpass all
historical [[authority]].  in the examples [[example]] which i here bring in, of what i
have heard, [[read]], done, or said, i have forbidden myself to dare to alter
even the most [[light]] and indifferent circumstances; my [[conscience]] does not
falsify one tittle; what my ignorance may do, i cannot say.

and this it is that makes me sometimes [[doubt]] in my own [[mind]], whether a
divine, or a philosopher, and such [[men]] of exact and tender prudence and
conscience, are fit to write [[history]]: for how can they stake their
reputation upon a popular [[faith]]? how be responsible for the opinions [[opinion]] of
men they do not [[know]]? and with what assurance deliver their conjectures
for current [[pay]]?  of actions performed before their own [[eyes]], wherein
several persons [[person]] were actors, they would be unwilling to give evidence
upon oath before a [[judge]]; and there is no [[man]], so familiarly known to
them, for whose intentions they would become absolute caution.  for my
part, i [[think]] it less hazardous to write of things [[past]], than [[present]], by
how much the writer is only to give an account of things every one knows
he must of necessity borrow upon trust.

i am solicited to write the affairs of my own [[time]] by some, who fancy i
look upon them with an eye less blinded with passion than another, and
have a clearer insight into them by [[reason]] of the [[free]] access [[fortune]] has
given me to the heads of various factions; but they do not consider, that
to purchase the [[glory]] of sallust, i would not give myself the trouble,
sworn [[enemy]] as i am to obligation, assiduity, or perseverance: that there
is nothing so contrary to my style, as a continued narrative, i so often
interrupt and cut myself short in my writing for want of breath; i have
neither composition nor explanation worth anything, and am ignorant,
beyond a child, of the phrases and even the very words proper to express
the most [[common]] things; and for that [[reason]] it is, that i have undertaken
to say only what i can say, and have accommodated my [[subject]] to my
strength.  should i take one to be my guide, peradventure i should not be
able to keep pace with him; and in the [[freedom]] of my [[liberty]] might
deliver judgments [[judgment]], which upon [[better]] thoughts [[thought]], and according to [[reason]],
would be illegitimate and punishable.  plutarch would say of what he has
delivered to us, that it is the [[work]] of others: that his examples [[example]] are all
and everywhere exactly true: that they are useful to [[posterity]], and are
presented with a lustre that will [[light]] us the way to [[virtue]], is his own
work.  it is not of so dangerous consequence, as in a medicinal drug,
whether an old story be so or so.




chapter xxi

that the [[profit]] of one [[man]] is the damage of another

demades the athenian--[seneca, de beneficiis, vi. 38, whence nearly the
whole of this [[chapter]] is taken.]--condemned one of his [[city]], whose trade
it was to sell the necessaries for [[funeral]] ceremonies [[ceremony]], upon pretence that
he demanded unreasonable [[profit]], and that that [[profit]] could not accrue to
him, but by the [[death]] of a [[great]] number of [[people]].  a [[judgment]] that
appears to be ill grounded, forasmuch as no [[profit]] whatever can possibly
be made but at the expense of another, and that by the same [[rule]] he
should condemn all gain of what [[kind]] soever.  the merchant only thrives
by the debauchery of [[youth]], the husband [[man]] by the dearness of grain, the
architect by the ruin of buildings, lawyers and officers of [[justice]] by
the suits and contentions of [[men]]: nay, even the [[honour]] and office of
divines are derived from our [[death]] and vices [[vice]].  a physician takes no
pleasure in the health even of his [[friends]], says the ancient [[greek]] comic
writer, nor a soldier in the [[peace]] of his [[country]], and so of the rest.
and, which is yet worse, let every one but dive into his own bosom, and
he will find his private wishes [[wish]] spring and his secret hopes [[hope]] grow up at
another’s expense.  upon which consideration it comes into my head, that
nature does not in this swerve from her general polity; for physicians
hold, that the birth, nourishment, and increase of every thing is the
dissolution and [[corruption]] of another:

          “nam quodcumque suis mutatum finibus exit,
          continuo hoc mors est illius, quod fuit ante.”

chapter xxii

of custom, and that we should not easily [[change]] a [[law]] received

he seems to me to have had a [[right]] and true apprehension of the [[power]] of
custom, who first [[invented]] the story of a country-woman who, having
accustomed herself to play with and carry a [[young]] calf in her arms, and
daily continuing to do so as it grew up, obtained this by custom, that,
when grown to be a [[great]] ox, she was still able to bear it.  for, in
truth, custom is a [[violent]] and [[treacherous]] schoolmistress.  she, by
little and little, slily and unperceived, slips in the foot of her
authority, but having by this gentle and humble beginning, with the
benefit of [[time]], fixed and established it, she then unmasks a furious and
tyrannic countenance, against which we have no more the [[courage]] or the
power so much as to lift up our [[eyes]].  we see her, at every turn, forcing
and violating the rules [[rule]] of [[nature]]:

          “usus efficacissimus rerum omnium magister.”

          [“custom is the [[best]] master of all things.”
           --pliny, nat.  hist.,xxvi. 2.]

i refer to her plato’s cave in his [[republic]], and the physicians, who so
often submit the reasons [[reason]] of their art [[arts]] to her [[authority]]; as the story of
that [[king]], who by custom brought his stomach to that pass, as to [[live]] by
poison, and the maid that albertus reports to have lived upon spiders.
in that new [[world]] of the indies, there were found [[great]] nations, and in
very differing climates, who were of the same diet, made provision of
them, and fed them for their tables; as also, they did grasshoppers,
mice, lizards, and bats; and in a [[time]] of scarcity of such delicacies, a
toad was sold for six crowns [[crown]], all which they cook, and dish up with
several sauces.  there were also others found, to whom our diet, and the
flesh we [[eat]], were venomous and mortal:

          “consuetudinis magna vis est: pernoctant venatores in nive:
          in montibus uri se patiuntur: pugiles, caestibus contusi,
          ne ingemiscunt quidem.”

     [“the [[power]] of custom is very [[great]]: huntsmen will [[lie]] out all
     night in the snow, or suffer themselves to be burned up by the sun
     on the mountains; boxers, hurt by the caestus, never utter a
     groan.”--cicero, tusc., ii. 17]

these [[strange]] examples [[example]] will not appear so [[strange]] if we consider what we
have ordinary [[experience]] of, how much custom stupefies our senses.  we
need not go to what is reported of the [[people]] about the cataracts of the
nile; and what [[philosophers]] [[believe]] of the [[music]] of the spheres, that the
bodies of those circles being solid and smooth, and coming to touch and
rub upon one another, cannot fail of creating a marvellous harmony, the
changes and cadences of which cause the revolutions [[revolution]] and dances of the
stars; but that the hearing sense of all creatures here below, being
universally, like that of the [[egyptians]], deafened, and stupefied with the
continual noise, cannot, how [[great]] soever, perceive it--[this passage is
taken from cicero, “dream of scipio”; see his de republica, vi.  ii.  the
egyptians were said to be stunned by the noise of the cataracts.]--
smiths, millers, pewterers, forgemen, and armourers could never be able
to [[live]] in the perpetual noise of their own trades [[trade]], did it strike their
ears with the same [[violence]] that it does ours.

my perfumed doublet gratifies my own scent at first; but after i have
worn it three days together, ‘tis only pleasing to the bystanders.  this
is yet more [[strange]], that custom, notwithstanding long intermissions and
intervals, should yet have the [[power]] to unite and establish the effect of
its impressions upon our senses, as is manifest in such as [[live]] near unto
steeples and the frequent noise of the bells.  i myself [[lie]] at [[home]] in a
tower, where every morning and evening a very [[great]] bell rings out the
ave maria: the noise shakes my very tower, and at first seemed
insupportable to me; but i am so used to it, that i hear it without any
manner of offence, and often without awaking at it.

plato--[diogenes laertius, iii. 38.  but he whom [[plato]] censured was not
a boy playing at nuts, but a [[man]] throwing dice.]--reprehending a boy for
playing at nuts, “thou reprovest me,” says the boy, “for a very little
thing.”  “custom,” replied [[plato]], “is no little thing.”  i find that our
greatest vices [[vice]] derive their first propensity from our most tender
infancy, and that our principal [[education]] depends upon the nurse.
mothers are mightily pleased to see a child writhe off the neck of a
chicken, or to please itself with hurting a dog or a cat; and such wise
fathers there are in the [[world]], who look upon it as a notable mark of a
martial spirit, when they hear a [[son]] miscall, or see him domineer over a
poor peasant, or a lackey, that dares not reply, nor turn again; and a
great sign of wit, when they see him [[cheat]] and overreach his playfellow
by some malicious treachery and deceit.  yet these are the true seeds and
roots of [[cruelty]], [[tyranny]], and [[treason]]; they bud and put out there, and
afterwards shoot up vigorously, and grow to prodigious bulk, cultivated
by custom.  and it is a very dangerous mistake to excuse these vile
inclinations upon the tenderness of their [[age]], and the triviality of the
subject: first, it is [[nature]] that speaks, whose declaration is then more
sincere, and inward thoughts [[thought]] more undisguised, as it is more [[weak]] and
young; secondly, the deformity of cozenage does not consist nor depend
upon the difference betwixt crowns [[crown]] and pins; but i rather hold it more
just to conclude thus: why should he not cozen in crowns [[crown]] since he does it
in pins, than as they do, who say they only play for pins, they would not
do it if it were for [[money]]?  [[children]] should carefully be instructed to
abhor vices [[vice]] for their own contexture; and the [[natural]] deformity of those
vices ought so to be represented to them, that they may not only avoid
them in their actions, but especially so to abominate them in their
hearts, that the very [[thought]] should be hateful to them, with what mask
soever they may be disguised.

i [[know]] very well, for what concerns myself, that from having been brought
up in my [[childhood]] to a plain and straightforward way of dealing, and
from having had an aversion to all manner of juggling and foul play in my
childish sports [[sport]] and recreations (and, indeed, it is to be noted, that the
plays of [[children]] are not performed in play, but are to be judged in them
as their most serious actions), there is no game so small wherein from my
own bosom naturally, and without study or endeavour, i have not an
extreme aversion from deceit.  i shuffle and cut and make as much clatter
with the cards, and keep as strict account for farthings, as it were for
double pistoles; when winning or losing against my [[wife]] and [[daughter]],
‘tis indifferent to me, as when i play in [[good]] earnest with others, for
round sums.  at all times [[time]], and in all places, my own [[eyes]] are sufficient
to look to my fingers; i am not so narrowly watched by any other, neither
is there any i have more [[respect]] to.

i saw the other day, at my own house, a little fellow, a native of
nantes, born without arms, who has so well taught his feet to perform the
services his hands should have done him, that truly these have half
forgotten their [[natural]] office; and, indeed, the fellow calls them his
hands; with them he cuts anything, charges and discharges a pistol,
threads a needle, sews, writes, puts off his hat, combs his head, plays
at cards and dice, and all this with as much dexterity as any other could
do who had more, and more proper limbs to assist him.  the [[money]] i gave
him--for he gains his living by shewing these feats--he took in his foot,
as we do in our hand.  i have seen another who, being yet a boy,
flourished a two-handed [[sword]], and, if i may so say, handled a halberd
with the mere motions of his neck and shoulders for want of hands; tossed
them into the air, and caught them again, darted a dagger, and cracked a
whip as well as any coachman in [[france]].

but the effects of custom are much more manifest in the strange
impressions she imprints in our minds [[mind]], where she meets with less
resistance.  what has she not the [[power]] to impose upon our judgments [[judgment]] and
beliefs?  is there any so fantastic [[opinion]] (omitting the gross
impostures of religions [[religion]], with which we see so many [[great]] nations, and so
many understanding [[men]], so strangely besotted; for this being beyond the
reach of [[human]] [[reason]], any error is more excusable in such as are not
endued, through the [[divine]] bounty, with an extraordinary illumination
from above), but, of other opinions [[opinion]], are there any so extravagant, that
she has not planted and established for laws [[law]] in those parts of the world
upon which she has been pleased to exercise her [[power]]?  and therefore
that ancient exclamation was exceeding just:

       “non pudet physicum, id est speculatorem venatoremque naturae,
        ab animis consuetudine imbutis petere testimonium veritatis?”

     [“is it not a shame for a [[natural]] philosopher, that is, for an
     observer and hunter of [[nature]], to seek testimony of the [[truth]] from
     minds [[mind]] prepossessed by custom?”--cicero, de natura deor., i. 30.]

i do [[believe]], that no so absurd or ridiculous fancy can enter into human
imagination, that does not meet with some [[example]] of [[public]] practice, and
that, consequently, our [[reason]] does not ground and back up.  there are
people, amongst whom it is the [[fashion]] to turn their backs upon him they
salute, and never look upon the [[man]] they intend to [[honour]].  there is a
place, where, whenever the [[king]] spits, the [[greatest]] ladies [[lady]] of his court
put out their hands to receive it; and another nation, where the most
eminent persons [[person]] about him stoop to take up his ordure in a linen cloth.
let us here steal room to insert a story.

a french gentleman was always wont to blow his nose with his fingers (a
thing very much against our fashion), and he justifying himself for so
doing, and he was a [[man]] famous for pleasant repartees, he [[asked]] me, what
privilege this filthy excrement had, that we must carry about us a fine
handkerchief to receive it, and, which was more, afterwards to lap it
carefully up, and carry it all day about in our pockets, which, he said,
could not but be much more nauseous and offensive, than to see it thrown
away, as we did all other evacuations.  i found that what he said was not
altogether without [[reason]], and by being frequently in his company, that
slovenly action of his was at [[last]] grown familiar to me; which
nevertheless we make a face at, when we hear it reported of another
country.  [[miracles]] appear to be so, according to our ignorance of [[nature]],
and not according to the essence of [[nature]] the continually being
accustomed to anything, blinds the eye of our [[judgment]].  barbarians are
no more a wonder to us, than we are to them; nor with any more [[reason]], as
every one would confess, if after having travelled over those remote
examples, [[men]] could settle themselves to reflect upon, and rightly to
confer them, with their own.  [[human]] [[reason]] is a tincture almost equally
infused into all our opinions [[opinion]] and manners, of what form soever they are;
infinite in matter, infinite in [[diversity]].  but i return to my [[subject]].

there are peoples [[people]], where, his [[wife]] and [[children]] excepted, no one speaks
to the [[king]] but through a tube.  in one and the same nation, the virgins
discover those parts that modesty should persuade them to hide, and the
married [[women]] carefully cover and conceal them.  to which, this custom,
in another place, has some relation, where chastity, but in [[marriage]], is
of no esteem, for unmarried [[women]] may prostitute themselves to as many as
they please, and being got with child, may lawfully take physic, in the
sight of every one, to [[destroy]] their fruit.  and, in another place, if a
tradesman [[marry]], all of the same condition, who are invited to the
wedding, [[lie]] with the bride before him; and the greater number of them
there is, the greater is her [[honour]], and the [[opinion]] of her ability and
strength: if an officer [[marry]], ‘tis the same, the same with a labourer,
or one of mean condition; but then it belongs to the [[lord]] of the place to
perform that office; and yet a severe loyalty during [[marriage]] is
afterward strictly enjoined.  there are places where brothels of young
men are kept for the [[pleasure]] of [[women]]; where the wives [[wife]] go to [[war]] as well
as the husbands, and not only share in the dangers of [[battle]], but,
moreover, in the honours [[honour]] of command.  others, where they wear rings not
only through their noses, lips, cheeks, and on their toes, but also
weighty gimmals of gold thrust through their paps and buttocks; where, in
eating, they wipe their fingers upon their thighs, genitories, and the
soles of their feet: where [[children]] are excluded, and brothers [[brother]] and
nephews only inherit; and elsewhere, nephews only, saving in the
succession of the [[prince]]: where, for the regulation of [[community]] in goods
and estates, observed in the [[country]], [[certain]] [[sovereign]] magistrates have
committed to them the universal charge and overseeing of the agriculture,
and distribution of the fruits, according to the necessity of every one
where they lament the [[death]] of [[children]], and feast at the decease of old
men: where they [[lie]] ten or twelve in a bed, [[men]] and their wives [[wife]] together:
where [[women]], whose husbands come to [[violent]] ends, may [[marry]] again, and
others not: where the condition of [[women]] is looked upon with such
contempt, that they kill all the native females, and buy wives [[wife]] of their
neighbours to supply their use; where husbands may repudiate their wives [[wife]],
without showing any cause, but wives [[wife]] cannot part from their husbands, for
what cause soever; where husbands may sell their wives [[wife]] in case of
sterility; where they boil the bodies [[body]] of their [[dead]], and afterward pound
them to a pulp, which they mix with their wine, and drink it; where the
most coveted sepulture is to be eaten by dogs, and elsewhere by birds;
where they [[believe]] the souls [[soul]] of the blessed [[live]] in all manner of
liberty, in delightful fields, furnished with all sorts of delicacies,
and that it is these souls [[soul]], repeating the words we utter, which we call
echo; where they [[fight]] in the water, and shoot their arrows with the most
mortal aim, swimming; where, for a sign of subjection, they lift up their
shoulders, and hang down their heads; where they put off their shoes when
they enter the king’s palace; where the eunuchs, who take charge of the
sacred [[women]], have, moreover, their lips and noses cut off, that they may
not be loved; where the priests [[priest]] put out their own [[eyes]], to be better
acquainted with their demons, and the [[better]] to receive their oracles;
where every one makes to himself a deity of what he likes [[best]]; the
hunter of a lion or a fox, the fisher of some fish; idols of every human
action or passion; in which place, the sun, the moon, and the [[earth]] are
the ‘principal deities, and the form of taking an oath is, to touch the
earth, looking up to [[heaven]]; where both flesh and fish is eaten raw;
where the [[greatest]] oath they take is, to swear by the name of some dead
person of [[reputation]], laying their hand upon his tomb; where the
newyear’s gift the [[king]] sends every year to the princes [[prince]], his vassals, is
fire, which being brought, all the old [[fire]] is put out, and the
neighbouring [[people]] are bound to fetch of the new, every one for
themselves, upon [[pain]] of high [[treason]]; where, when the [[king]], to betake
himself wholly to devotion, retires from his administration (which often
falls out), his next successor is obliged to do the same, and the right
of the [[kingdom]] devolves to the third in succession: where they vary the
form of [[government]], according to the seeming necessity of affairs: depose
the [[king]] when they [[think]] [[good]], substituting [[certain]] elders to govern in
his stead, and sometimes transferring it into the hands of the
commonality: where [[men]] and [[women]] are both circumcised and also baptized:
where the soldier, who in one or several engagements, has been so
fortunate as to [[present]] seven of the enemies’ heads to the [[king]], is made
noble: where they [[live]] in that rare and unsociable [[opinion]] of the
mortality of the [[soul]]: where the [[women]] are delivered without [[pain]] or
fear: where the [[women]] wear copper leggings upon both legs, and if a louse
bite them, are bound in magnanimity to bite them again, and dare not
marry, till first they have made their [[king]] a tender of their virginity,
if he please to accept it: where the ordinary way of salutation is by
putting a finger down to the [[earth]], and then pointing it up toward
heaven: where [[men]] carry burdens upon their heads, and [[women]] on their
shoulders; where the [[women]] make water standing, and the [[men]] squatting:
where they send their [[blood]] in token of [[friendship]], and offer incense to
the [[men]] they would [[honour]], like gods: where, not only to the fourth, but
in any other remote [[degree]], kindred are not permitted to [[marry]]: where the
children are four years at nurse, and often twelve; in which place, also,
it is accounted mortal to give the child suck the first day after it is
born: where the correction of the male [[children]] is peculiarly designed to
the fathers [[father]], and to the mothers [[mother]] of the girls; the [[punishment]] being to
hang them by the heels in the smoke: where they circumcise the [[women]]:
where they [[eat]] all sorts of herbs, without other scruple than of the
badness of the smell: where all things are open the finest houses,
furnished in the richest manner, without doors, windows, trunks, or
chests to lock, a thief being there punished double what they are in
other places: where they crack lice with their teeth like monkeys, and
abhor to see them killed with one’s nails: where in all their lives [[life]] they
neither cut their hair nor pare their nails; and, in another place, pare
those of the [[right]] hand only, letting the left grow for ornament and
bravery: where they suffer the hair on the [[right]] side to grow as long as
it will, and shave the other; and in the neighbouring provinces, some let
their hair grow long before, and some behind, shaving close the rest:
where parents let out their [[children]], and husbands their wives [[wife]], to their
guests to hire: where a [[man]] may get his own [[mother]] with child, and
fathers make use of their own daughters [[daughter]] or sons [[son]], without scandal: where,
at their solemn feasts, they interchangeably lend their [[children]] to one
another, without any consideration of nearness of [[blood]].  in one place,
men feed upon [[human]] flesh; in another, ‘tis reputed a pious office for a
man to kill his [[father]] at a [[certain]] [[age]]; elsewhere, the fathers [[father]] dispose
of their [[children]], whilst yet in their mothers’ wombs, some to be
preserved and carefully brought up, and others to be abandoned or made
away.  elsewhere the old husbands lend their wives [[wife]] to [[young]] [[men]]; and in
another place they are in [[common]] without offence; in one place
particularly, the [[women]] take it for a mark of [[honour]] to have as many gay
fringed tassels at the bottom of their garment, as they have lain with
several [[men]].  moreover, has not custom made a [[republic]] of women
separately by themselves? has it not put arms into their hands, and made
them raise armies [[army]] and [[fight]] battles [[battle]]?  and does she not, by her own
precept, instruct the most ignorant vulgar, and make them [[perfect]] in
things which all the [[philosophy]] in the [[world]] could never beat into the
heads of the wisest [[men]]?  for we [[know]] entire nations, where [[death]] was not
only despised, but entertained with the [[greatest]] triumph; where children
of seven years old [[suffered]] themselves to be whipped to [[death]], without
changing countenance; where riches [[rich]] were in such contempt, that the
meanest citizen would not have deigned to stoop to take up a purse of
crowns.  and we [[know]] regions, very fruitful in all manner of provisions,
where, notwithstanding, the most ordinary diet, and that they are most
pleased with, is only bread, cresses, and water.  did not custom,
moreover, [[work]] that miracle in chios that, in seven hundred years, it was
never known that ever maid or [[wife]] committed any act to the prejudice of
her [[honour]]?

to conclude; there is nothing, in my [[opinion]], that she does not, or may
not do; and therefore, with very [[good]] [[reason]] it is that pindar calls her
the ruler of the [[world]].  he that was seen to beat his [[father]], and
reproved for so doing, made [[answer]], that it was the custom of their
family; that, in like manner, his [[father]] had beaten his grandfather, his
grandfather his great-grandfather, “and this,” says he, pointing to his
son, “when he comes to my [[age]], shall beat me.”  and the [[father]], whom the
son dragged and hauled along the streets, commanded him to stop at a
certain door, for he himself, he said, had dragged his [[father]] no farther,
that being the utmost limit of the hereditary outrage the sons [[son]] used to
practise upon the fathers [[father]] in their [[family]].  it is as much by custom as
infirmity, says [[aristotle]], that [[women]] tear their hair, bite their nails,
and [[eat]] coals and [[earth]], and more by custom than [[nature]] that [[men]] abuse
themselves with one another.

the laws [[law]] of [[conscience]], which we pretend to be derived from [[nature]],
proceed from custom; every one, having an inward veneration for the
opinions and manners approved and received amongst his own [[people]],
cannot, without very [[great]] reluctance, depart from them, nor apply
himself to them without applause.  in times [[time]] [[past]], when those of crete
would curse any one, they prayed the gods to engage him in some ill
custom.  but the principal effect of its [[power]] is, so to seize and
ensnare us, that it is hardly in us to disengage ourselves from its
gripe, or so to come to ourselves, as to consider of and to weigh the
things it enjoins.  to say the [[truth]], by [[reason]] that we suck it in with
our milk, and that the face of the [[world]] presents [[present]] itself in this posture
to our first sight, it seems as if we were born upon condition to follow
on this track; and the [[common]] fancies that we find in repute everywhere
about us, and infused into our minds [[mind]] with the seed of our fathers [[father]], appear
to be the most universal and [[genuine]]; from whence it comes to pass, that
whatever is off the hinges of custom, is believed to be also off the
hinges of [[reason]]; how unreasonably for the most part, [[god]] knows [[know]].

if, as we who study ourselves have learned to do, every one who hears a
good sentence, would immediately consider how it does in any way touch
his own private concern, every one would find, that it was not so much a
good saying, as a severe lash to the ordinary stupidity of his own
judgment: but [[men]] receive the precepts and admonitions of [[truth]], as
directed to the [[common]] sort, and never to themselves; and instead of
applying them to their own manners, do only very ignorantly and
unprofitably commit them to memory.  but let us return to the [[empire]] of
custom.

such [[people]] as have been bred up to [[liberty]], and [[subject]] to no other
dominion but the [[authority]] of their own will, look upon all other form of
government as monstrous and contrary to [[nature]].  those who are inured to
monarchy do the same; and what opportunity soever [[fortune]] presents [[present]] them
with to [[change]], even then, when with the [[greatest]] difficulties they have
disengaged themselves from one master, that was troublesome and grievous
to them, they presently run, with the same difficulties, to create
another; being unable to take into [[hatred]] subjection itself.

‘tis by the mediation of custom, that every one is content with the place
where he is planted by [[nature]]; and the highlanders of [[scotland]] no more
pant after touraine; than the scythians after thessaly.  darius asking
certain greeks [[greek]] what they would take to assume the custom of the indians [[indian]],
of eating the [[dead]] bodies [[body]] of their fathers [[father]] (for that was their use,
believing they could not give them a [[better]] nor more [[noble]] sepulture than
to bury them in their own bodies), they made [[answer]], that nothing in the
world should hire them to do it; but having also tried to persuade the
indians to leave their custom, and, after the [[greek]] manner, to burn the
bodies of their fathers [[father]], they conceived a still greater [[horror]] at the
motion.--[herodotus, iii. 38.]--every one does the same, for use veils
from us the true aspect of things.

         “nil adeo magnum, nec tam mirabile quidquam
          principio, quod non minuant mirarier omnes paullatim.”

     [“there is nothing at first so grand, so admirable, which by degrees
     [[people]] do not regard with less admiration.”--lucretius, ii. 1027]

taking upon me once to justify something in use amongst us, and that was
received with absolute [[authority]] for a [[great]] many leagues round about us,
and not content, as [[men]] commonly do, to establish it only by [[force]] of law
and [[example]], but inquiring still further into its origin, i found the
foundation so [[weak]], that i who made it my [[business]] to confirm others, was
very near being dissatisfied myself.  ‘tis by this receipt that plato
--[laws, viii.  6.]--undertakes to cure the unnatural and preposterous
loves of his [[time]], as one which he esteems of [[sovereign]] [[virtue]], namely,
that the [[public]] [[opinion]] condemns them; that the poets, and all other
sorts of writers, relate horrible stories of them; a recipe, by [[virtue]] of
which the most beautiful daughters [[daughter]] no more allure their fathers’ [[lust]];
nor brothers [[brother]], of the finest shape and [[fashion]], their sisters’ [[desire]]; the
very fables of thyestes, oedipus, and macareus, having with the harmony
of their [[song]], infused this wholesome [[opinion]] and [[belief]] into the tender
brains of [[children]].  chastity is, in [[truth]], a [[great]] and shining [[virtue]],
and of which the utility is sufficiently known; but to treat of it, and
to set it off in its true value, according to [[nature]], is as hard as ‘tis
easy to do so according to custom, laws [[law]], and precepts.  the fundamental
and universal reasons [[reason]] are of very obscure and difficult research, and our
masters either lightly pass them over, or not daring so much as to touch
them, precipitate themselves into the [[liberty]] and protection of custom,
there puffing themselves out and triumphing to their heart’s content:
such as will not suffer themselves to be withdrawn from this original
source, do yet commit a greater error, and [[subject]] themselves to wild
opinions; witness chrysippus,--[sextus empiricus, pyyrhon.  hypotyp., i.
14.]--who, in so many of his writings, has strewed the little account he
made of incestuous conjunctions, committed with how near relations
soever.

whoever would disengage himself from this [[violent]] prejudice of custom,
would find several things received with absolute and undoubting [[opinion]],
that have no other support than the hoary head and rivelled face of
ancient usage.  but the mask taken off, and things being referred to the
decision of [[truth]] and [[reason]], he will find his [[judgment]] as it were
altogether overthrown, and yet restored to a much more sure estate.  for
example, i shall ask him, what can be more [[strange]] than to see a people
obliged to obey laws [[law]] they never understood; bound in all their domestic
affairs, as marriages [[marriage]], donations, wills, sales, and purchases, to rules
they cannot possibly [[know]], being neither written nor published in their
own [[language]], and of which they are of necessity to purchase both the
interpretation and the use?  not according to the ingenious [[opinion]] of
isocrates,--[discourse to nicocles.]--who counselled his [[king]] to make
the traffics and negotiations of his subjects [[subject]], [[free]], frank, and of profit
to them, and their quarrels and disputes burdensome, and laden with heavy
impositions and penalties; but, by a prodigious [[opinion]], to make sale of
reason itself, and to give to laws [[law]] a course of merchandise.  i think
myself obliged to [[fortune]] that, as our historians report, it was a gascon
gentleman, a countryman of mine, who first opposed charlemagne, when he
attempted to impose upon us latin and imperial laws [[law]].

what can be more savage, than to see a nation where, by lawful custom,
the office of a [[judge]] is bought and sold, where judgments [[judgment]] are paid for
with ready [[money]], and where [[justice]] may legitimately be denied to him
that has not wherewithal to [[pay]]; a merchandise in so [[great]] repute, as in
a [[government]] to create a fourth estate of wrangling lawyers, to add to
the three ancient ones of the [[church]], nobility, and [[people]]; which fourth
estate, having the laws [[law]] in their own hands, and [[sovereign]] [[power]] over
men’s lives [[life]] and fortunes [[fortune]], makes another [[body]] separate from nobility:
whence it comes to pass, that there are double laws [[law]], those of [[honour]] and
those of [[justice]], in many things altogether opposite one to another; the
nobles as rigorously condemning a [[lie]] taken, as the other do a lie
revenged: by the [[law]] of arms, he shall be degraded from all nobility and
honour who puts up with an affront; and by the civil [[law]], he who
vindicates his [[reputation]] by [[revenge]] incurs a [[capital]] [[punishment]]: he who
applies himself to the [[law]] for reparation of an offence done to his
honour, disgraces himself; and he who does not, is censured and punished
by the [[law]].  yet of these two so different things, both of them referring
to one head, the one has the charge of [[peace]], the other of [[war]]; those
have the [[profit]], these the [[honour]]; those the [[wisdom]], these the [[virtue]];
those the word, these the action; those [[justice]], these valour; those
reason, these [[force]]; those the long robe, these the short;--divided
betwixt them.

for what concerns indifferent things, as clothes, who is there seeking to
bring them back to their true use, which is the body’s service and
convenience, and upon which their original grace and fitness depend; for
the most fantastic, in my [[opinion]], that can be imagined, i will instance
amongst others, our flat caps, that long tail of velvet that hangs down
from our women’s heads, with its party-coloured trappings; and that vain
and futile model of a member we cannot in modesty so much as name, which,
nevertheless, we make show and parade of in [[public]].  these
considerations, notwithstanding, will not prevail upon any understanding
man to decline the [[common]] mode; but, on the contrary, methinks, all
singular and particular fashions are rather marks of folly and vain
affectation than of sound [[reason]], and that a [[wise]] [[man]], within, ought to
withdraw and retire his [[soul]] from the crowd, and there keep it at liberty
and in [[power]] to [[judge]] freely of things; but as to externals, absolutely
to [[follow]] and conform himself to the [[fashion]] of the [[time]].  [[public]] society
has nothing to do with our thoughts [[thought]], but the rest, as our actions, our
labours, our fortunes [[fortune]], and our lives [[life]], we are to lend and abandon them to
its service and to the [[common]] [[opinion]], as did that [[good]] and great
socrates who refused to preserve his [[life]] by a disobedience to the
magistrate, though a very wicked and [[unjust]] one for it is the [[rule]] of
rules, the general [[law]] of laws [[law]], that every one observe those of the place
wherein he lives [[life]].

          [“it is [[good]] to obey the laws [[law]] of one’s [[country]].”
           --excerpta ex trag. gyaecis, grotio interp., 1626, p. 937.]

and now to another point.  it is a very [[great]] [[doubt]], whether any so
manifest benefit can accrue from the alteration of a [[law]] received, let it
be what it will, as there is danger and inconvenience in altering it;
forasmuch as [[government]] is a structure composed of divers parts and
members joined and [[united]] together, with so strict connection, that it is
impossible to stir so much as one brick or stone, but the whole [[body]] will
be sensible of it.  the legislator of the thurians--[charondas; diod.
sic., xii.  24.]--ordained, that whosoever would go about either to
abolish an old [[law]], or to establish a new, should [[present]] himself with a
halter about his neck to the [[people]], to the end, that if the innovation
he would introduce should not be approved by every one, he might
immediately be [[hanged]]; and he of the lacedaemonians employed his [[life]] to
obtain from his [[citizens]] a faithful promise that none of his laws [[law]] should
be violated.--[lycurgus; plutarch, in vita, c.  22.]--the ephoros who so
rudely cut the two strings that phrynis had added to [[music]] never stood to
examine whether that addition made [[better]] harmony, or that by its means
the instrument was more full and complete; it was enough for him to
condemn the invention, that it was a novelty, and an alteration of the
old [[fashion]].  which also is the meaning of the old rusty [[sword]] carried
before the magistracy of marseilles.

for my own part, i have a [[great]] aversion from a novelty, what face or
what pretence soever it may carry along with it, and have [[reason]], having
been an eyewitness of the [[great]] evils [[evil]] it has produced.  for those which
for so many years have lain so heavy upon us, it is not wholly
accountable; but one may say, with colour enough, that it has
accidentally produced and begotten the mischiefs and ruin that have since
happened, both without and against it; it, principally, we are to accuse
for these disorders:

               “heu! patior telis vulnera facta meis.”

          [“alas!  the wounds were made by my own [[weapons]].”
           --ovid, ep. phyll. demophoonti, vers. 48.]

they who give the first shock to a [[state]], are almost naturally the first
overwhelmed in its ruin the fruits of [[public]] commotion are seldom enjoyed
by him who was the first motor; he beats and disturbs the water for
another’s net.  the unity and contexture of this [[monarchy]], of this grand
edifice, having been ripped and torn in her old [[age]], by this thing called
innovation, has since laid open a rent, and given sufficient admittance
to such injuries: the [[royal]] majesty with greater difficulty declines from
the summit to the middle, then it falls and tumbles headlong from the
middle to the bottom.  but if the inventors do the greater mischief, the
imitators are more vicious to [[follow]] examples [[example]] of which they have [[felt]] and
punished both the [[horror]] and the offence.  and if there can be any degree
of [[honour]] in ill-doing, these [[last]] must yield to the others the [[glory]] of
contriving, and the [[courage]] of making the first attempt.  all sorts of
new disorders easily draw, from this primitive and ever-flowing fountain,
examples and precedents to trouble and discompose our [[government]]: we read
in our very laws [[law]], made for the remedy of this first [[evil]], the beginning
and pretences of all sorts of wicked enterprises; and that befalls us,
which thucydides said of the civil wars [[war]] of his [[time]], that, in favour of
public vices [[vice]], they gave them new and more plausible names for their
excuse, sweetening and disguising their true titles; which must be done,
forsooth, to reform our [[conscience]] and [[belief]]:

                    “honesta oratio est;”

          [“fine words truly.”--ter.  and., i. i, 114.]

but the [[best]] pretence for innovation is of very dangerous consequence:

          “aden nihil motum ex antiquo probabile est.”

     [“we are ever [[wrong]] in changing ancient ways.”--livy, xxxiv. 54]

and freely to speak my thoughts [[thought]], it argues a [[strange]] self-love and great
presumption to be so fond of one’s own opinions [[opinion]], that a [[public]] [[peace]] must
be overthrown to establish them, and to introduce so many inevitable
mischiefs, and so dreadful a [[corruption]] of manners, as a civil [[war]] and
the mutations of [[state]] consequent to it, always bring in their train, and
to introduce them, in a thing of so high concern, into the bowels of
one’s own [[country]].  can there be worse husbandry than to set up so many
certain and knowing vices [[vice]] against errors that are only contested and
disputable?  and are there any worse sorts of vices [[vice]] than those committed
against a man’s own [[conscience]], and the [[natural]] [[light]] of his own [[reason]]?
the senate, upon the dispute betwixt it and the [[people]] about the
administration of their [[religion]], was bold enough to return this evasion
for current [[pay]]:

          “ad deos id magis, quam ad se, pertinere: ipsos visuros,
          ne sacra sua polluantur;”

     [“those things belong to the gods to determine than to them; let the
     gods, therefore, take [[care]] that their [[sacred]] mysteries were not
     profaned.”--livy, x. 6.]

according to what the oracle answered to those of delphos who, fearing to
be invaded by the persians in the median [[war]], inquired of [[apollo]], how
they should dispose of the holy treasure of his temple; whether they
should hide, or remove it to some other place?  he returned them [[answer]],
that they should stir nothing from thence, and only take [[care]] of
themselves, for he was sufficient to look to what belonged to him.
--[herodotus, viii. 36.].--

the [[christian]] [[religion]] has all the marks of the utmost utility and
justice: but none more manifest than the severe injunction it lays
indifferently upon all to yield absolute [[obedience]] to the civil
magistrate, and to maintain and defend the laws [[law]].  of which, what a
wonderful [[example]] has the [[divine]] [[wisdom]] left us, that, to establish the
salvation of [[mankind]], and to conduct his glorious [[victory]] over [[death]] and
sin, would do it after no other way, but at the [[mercy]] of our ordinary
forms of [[justice]] subjecting the [[progress]] and issue of so high and so
salutiferous an effect, to the blindness and [[injustice]] of our customs
and observances; sacrificing the [[innocent]] [[blood]] of so many of his elect,
and so long a loss of so many years, to the maturing of this inestimable
fruit?  there is a vast difference betwixt the case of one who follows
the forms and laws [[law]] of his [[country]], and of another who will undertake to
regulate and [[change]] them; of whom the first pleads simplicity, [[obedience]],
and [[example]] for his excuse, who, whatever he shall do, it cannot be
imputed to malice; ‘tis at the worst but misfortune:

          “quis est enim, quem non moveat clarissimis monumentis
          testata consignataque antiquitas?”

     [“for who is there that antiquity, attested and confirmed by the
     fairest monuments, cannot move?”--cicero, de divin., i. 40.]

besides what isocrates says, that defect is nearer allied to moderation
than excess: the other is a much more ruffling gamester; for whosoever
shall take upon him to choose and alter, usurps the [[authority]] of judging,
and should look well about him, and make it his [[business]] to discern
clearly the defect of what he would abolish, and the [[virtue]] of what he is
about to introduce.

this so vulgar consideration is that which settled me in my station, and
kept even my most extravagant and ungoverned [[youth]] under the rein, so as
not to burden my shoulders with so [[great]] a weight, as to render myself
responsible for a [[science]] of that importance, and in this to dare, what
in my [[better]] and more mature [[judgment]], i durst not do in the most easy
and indifferent things i had been instructed in, and wherein the temerity
of judging is of no consequence at all; it seeming to me very [[unjust]] to
go about to [[subject]] [[public]] and established customs and [[institutions]], to
the weakness and instability of a private and particular fancy (for
private [[reason]] has but a private jurisdiction), and to attempt that upon
the [[divine]], which no [[government]] will endure a [[man]] should do, upon the
civil laws [[law]]; with which, though [[human]] [[reason]] has much more commerce than
with the other, yet are they sovereignly judged by their own proper
judges, and the extreme sufficiency serves only to expound and set forth
the [[law]] and custom received, and neither to wrest it, nor to introduce
anything, of innovation.  if, sometimes, the [[divine]] providence has gone
beyond the rules [[rule]] to which it has necessarily bound and obliged us [[men]],
it is not to give us any dispensation to do the same; those are
masterstrokes of the [[divine]] hand, which we are not to imitate, but to
admire, and extraordinary examples [[example]], marks of express and particular
purposes, of the [[nature]] of [[miracles]], presented before us for
manifestations of its almightiness, equally above both our rules [[rule]] and
force, which it would be folly and impiety to attempt to represent and
imitate; and that we ought not to [[follow]], but to contemplate with the
greatest reverence: acts of his personage, and not for us.  cotta very
opportunely declares:

     “quum de religione agitur, ti. coruncanium, p. scipionem,
     p. scaevolam, pontifices maximos, non zenonem, aut cleanthem,
     aut chrysippum, sequor.”

     [“when matter of [[religion]] is in [[question]], i [[follow]] the high priests
     t. coruncanius, p. scipio, p. scaevola, and not zeno, cleanthes, or
     chrysippus.”--cicero, de natura deor., iii. 2.]

god knows [[know]], in the [[present]] quarrel of our civil [[war]], where there are a
hundred articles to dash out and to put in, [[great]] and very considerable,
how many there are who can truly boast, they have exactly and perfectly
weighed and understood the grounds and reasons [[reason]] of the one and the other
party; ‘tis a number, if they make any number, that would be able to give
us very little disturbance.  but what becomes of all the rest, under what
ensigns do they march, in what quarter do they [[lie]]?  theirs have the same
effect with other [[weak]] and ill-applied medicines; they have only set the
humours they would purge more violently in [[work]], stirred and exasperated
by the conflict, and left them still behind.  the potion was too [[weak]] to
purge, but [[strong]] enough to weaken us; so that it does not [[work]], but we
keep it still in our bodies [[body]], and reap nothing from the operation but
intestine gripes and dolours.

so it is, nevertheless, that [[fortune]] still reserving her [[authority]] in
defiance of whatever we are able to do or say, sometimes presents [[present]] us with
a necessity so urgent, that ‘tis requisite the laws [[law]] should a little yield
and give way; and when one opposes the increase of an innovation that
thus intrudes itself by [[violence]], to keep a man’s [[self]] in so doing, in
all places and in all things within bounds and rules [[rule]] against those who
have the [[power]], and to whom all things are lawful that may in any way
serve to advance their design, who have no other [[law]] nor [[rule]] but what
serves [[best]] to their own [[purpose]], ‘tis a dangerous obligation and an
intolerable inequality:

               “aditum nocendi perfido praestat fides,”

          [“putting [[faith]] in a [[treacherous]] [[person]], opens the door to
          harm.”--seneca, oedip., act iii., verse 686.]

forasmuch as the ordinary discipline of a healthful [[state]] does not
provide against these extraordinary accidents; it presupposes a [[body]] that
supports itself in its principal members and offices, and a common
consent to its [[obedience]] and observation.  a legitimate proceeding is
cold, heavy, and constrained, and not fit to make head against a
headstrong and unbridled proceeding.  ‘tis known to be to this day cast
in the dish of those two [[great]] [[men]], octavius and cato, in the two civil
wars of sylla and caesar, that they would rather suffer their [[country]] to
undergo the [[last]] extremities, than relieve their fellow-citizens at the
expense of its laws [[law]], or be guilty of any innovation; for in [[truth]], in
these [[last]] necessities, where there is no other remedy, it would,
peradventure, be more discreetly done, to stoop and yield a little to
receive the blow, than, by opposing without possibility of doing [[good]],
to give [[occasion]] to [[violence]] to trample all under foot; and [[better]] to
make the laws [[law]] do what they can, when they cannot do what they would.
after this manner did he--[agesilaus.]--who suspended them for
four-and-twenty hours, and he who, for once shifted a day in the
calendar, and that other--[alexander the [[great]].]--who of the month of
june made a second of may.  the lacedaemonians themselves, who were so
religious observers of the laws [[law]] of their [[country]], being straitened by
one of their own edicts, by which it was expressly forbidden to choose
the same [[man]] twice to be admiral; and on the other side, their affairs
necessarily requiring, that lysander should again take upon him that
command, they made one aratus admiral; ‘tis true, but withal, lysander
went general of the navy; and, by the same subtlety, one of their
ambassadors being sent to the athenians to obtain the revocation of some
decree, and pericles remonstrating to him, that it was forbidden to take
away the tablet wherein a [[law]] had once been engrossed, he advised him to
turn it only, that being not forbidden; and plutarch commends
philopoemen, that being born to command, he knew how to do it, not only
according to the laws [[law]], but also to overrule even the laws [[law]] themselves,
when the [[public]] necessity so required.




chapter xxiii

various events from the same counsel

jacques amiot, grand almoner of [[france]], one day related to me this story,
much to the [[honour]] of a [[prince]] of ours (and ours he was upon several very
good accounts, though originally of [[foreign]] extraction),--[the duc de
guise, surnamed le balafre.]--that in the [[time]] of our first commotions,
at the siege of rouen,--[in 1562]--this [[prince]], having been advertised
by the queen-mother of a conspiracy against his [[life]], and in her letters
particular notice being given him of the [[person]] who was to execute the
business (who was a gentleman of anjou or of maine, and who to this
effect ordinarily frequented this prince’s house), discovered not a
syllable of this [[intelligence]] to any one whatever; but going the next day
to the st. catherine’s mount,--[an eminence outside rouen overlooking the
seine.  d.w.]--from which our battery played against the town (for it
was during the [[time]] of the siege), and having in company with him the
said [[lord]] almoner, and another bishop, he saw this gentleman, who had
been denoted to him, and presently sent for him; to whom, being come
before him, seeing him already pale and trembling with the [[conscience]] of
his guilt, he thus said, “monsieur,” such an one, “you guess what i have
to say to you; your countenance discovers it; ‘tis in [[vain]] to disguise
your practice, for i am so well informed of your [[business]], that it will
but make worse for you, to go about to conceal or deny it: you [[know]] very
well such and such passages” (which were the most secret circumstances of
his conspiracy), “and therefore be sure, as you tender your own [[life]],
to confess to me the whole [[truth]] of the design.”  the [[poor]] [[man]] seeing
himself thus trapped and convicted (for the whole [[business]] had been
discovered to the queen by one of the accomplices), was in such a taking,
he knew not what to do; but, folding his hands, to beg and sue for [[mercy]],
he threw himself at his prince’s feet, who taking him up, proceeded to
say, “come, sir; tell me, have i at any [[time]] done you offence?  or have
i, through private [[hatred]] or malice, offended any kinsman or friend of
yours?  it is not above three weeks that i have known you; what
inducement, then, could move you to attempt my [[death]]?”  to which the
gentleman with a trembling voice replied, “that it was no particular
grudge he had to his [[person]], but the general interest and concern of his
party, and that he had been put upon it by some who had persuaded him it
would be a meritorious act, by any means, to extirpate so [[great]] and so
powerful an [[enemy]] of their [[religion]].”  “well,” said the [[prince]], “i will
now let you see, how much more charitable the [[religion]] is that i
maintain, than that which you profess: yours has counselled you to kill
me, without hearing me speak, and without ever having given you any cause
of offence; and mine commands me to [[forgive]] you, convict as you are, by
your own [[confession]], of a design to kill me without [[reason]].--[imitated by
voltaire.  see nodier, questions [[question]], p. 165.]--get you gone; let me see you
no more; and, if you are [[wise]], choose henceforward honester [[men]] for your
counsellors in your designs.”--[dampmartin, la [[fortune]] de la coup, liv.
ii., p. 139]

the [[emperor]] augustus,--[this story is taken from seneca, de clementia,
i.  9.]--being in gaul, had [[certain]] information of a conspiracy l. cinna
was contriving against him; he therefore resolved to make him an [[example]];
and, to that end, sent to summon his [[friends]] to meet the next morning in
counsel.  but the night between he passed in [[great]] unquietness of [[mind]],
considering that he was about to put to [[death]] a [[young]] [[man]], of an
illustrious [[family]], and nephew to the [[great]] pompey, and this made him
break out into several passionate complainings.  “what then,” said he,
“is it possible that i am to [[live]] in perpetual [[anxiety]] and alarm, and
suffer my would-be assassin, meantime, to walk abroad at [[liberty]]?  shall
he go unpunished, after having conspired against my [[life]], a [[life]] that i
have hitherto defended in so many civil wars [[war]], in so many battles [[battle]] by land
and by sea?  and after having settled the universal [[peace]] of the whole
world, shall this [[man]] be pardoned, who has conspired not only to murder,
but to [[sacrifice]] me?”--for the conspiracy was to kill him at [[sacrifice]].
after which, remaining for some [[time]] silent, he began again, in louder
tones, and exclaimed against himself, saying:  “why livest thou, if it be
for the [[good]] of so many that thou shouldst [[die]]? must there be no end of
thy revenges and cruelties?  is thy [[life]] of so [[great]] value, that so many
mischiefs must be done to preserve it?”  his [[wife]] livia, seeing him in
this perplexity: “will you take a woman’s counsel?”  said she.  “do as
the physicians do, who, when the ordinary recipes will do no [[good]], make
trial of the contrary.  by severity you have hitherto prevailed nothing;
lepidus has followed salvidienus; murena, lepidus; caepio, murena;
egnatius, caepio.  begin now, and try how sweetness and clemency will
succeed.  cinna is convict; [[forgive]] him, he will never henceforth have
the [[heart]] to hurt thee, and it will be an act to thy [[glory]].”  augustus
was well pleased that he had met with an advocate of his own [[humour]];
wherefore, having thanked his [[wife]], and, in the morning, countermanded
his [[friends]] he had before summoned to council, he commanded cinna all
alone to be brought to him; who being accordingly come, and a chair by
his appointment set him, having ordered all the rest out of the room, he
spake to him after this manner: “in the first place, cinna, i demand of
thee patient audience; do not interrupt me in what i am about to say, and
i will afterwards give thee [[time]] and leisure to [[answer]].  thou knowest,
cinna,--[this passage, borrowed from seneca, has been paraphrased in
verse by corneille.  see nodier, questions [[question]] de la literature llgale, 1828,
pp. 7, 160.  the monologue of augustus in this [[chapter]] is also from
seneca.  ibid., 164.]--that having taken thee [[prisoner]] in the enemy’s
camp, and thou an [[enemy]], not only so become, but born so, i gave thee thy
life, restored to thee all thy goods [[good]], and, finally, put thee in so [[good]] a
posture, by my bounty, of living well and at thy ease, that the
victorious envied the conquered. the sacerdotal office which thou madest
suit to me for, i conferred upon thee, after having denied it to others,
whose fathers [[father]] have ever borne arms in my service.  after so many
obligations, thou hast undertaken to kill me.”  at which cinna crying out
that he was very far from entertaining any so wicked a [[thought]]: “thou
dost not keep thy promise, cinna,” continued augustus, “that thou wouldst
not interrupt me.  yes, thou hast undertaken to murder me in such a
place, on such a day, in such and such company, and in such a manner.”
 at which words, seeing cinna astounded and silent, not upon the account
of his promise so to be, but interdict with the weight of his [[conscience]]:
“why,” proceeded augustus, “to what end wouldst thou do it?  is it to be
emperor?  [[believe]] me, the [[republic]] is in very ill condition, if i am the
only [[man]] betwixt thee and the [[empire]].  thou art [[arts]] not able so much as to
defend thy own house, and but t’other day was baffled in a suit, by the
opposed interest of a mere manumitted [[slave]].  what, hast thou neither
means nor [[power]] in any other thing, but only to undertake caesar?  i quit
the [[throne]], if there be no other than i to obstruct thy hopes [[hope]].  canst
thou [[believe]] that paulus, that fabius, that the cossii and the servilii,
and so many [[noble]] romans, not only so in title, but who by their virtue
honour their nobility, would suffer or endure thee?”  after this, and a
great deal more that he said to him (for he was two long hours in
speaking), “now go, cinna, go thy way: i give thee that [[life]] as traitor
and parricide, which i before gave thee in the quality of an [[enemy]].  let
friendship from this [[time]] forward begin betwixt us, and let us show
whether i have given, or thou hast received thy [[life]] with the better
faith”; and so departed from him.  some [[time]] after, he preferred him to
the consular [[dignity]], complaining that he had not the confidence to
demand it; had him ever after for his very [[great]] friend, and was, at
last, made by him sole heir to all his estate.  now, from the [[time]] of
this accident which befell augustus in the fortieth year of his [[age]], he
never had any conspiracy or attempt against him, and so reaped the due
reward of this his so generous clemency.  but it did not so happen with
our [[prince]], his moderation and [[mercy]] not so securing him, but that he
afterwards fell into the toils of the like [[treason]],--[the duc de guise
was assassinated in 1563 by poltrot.]--so [[vain]] and futile a thing is
human prudence; throughout all our projects, counsels and precautions,
fortune will still be mistress of events.

we repute physicians fortunate when they hit upon a lucky cure, as if
there was no other art [[arts]] but theirs that could not stand upon its own legs,
and whose foundations are too [[weak]] to support itself upon its own basis;
as if no other art [[arts]] stood in need of fortune’s hand to [[help]] it.  for my
part, i [[think]] of physic as much [[good]] or ill as any one would have me:
for, thanks be to [[god]], we have no traffic together.  i am of a quite
contrary [[humour]] to other [[men]], for i always despise it; but when i am
sick, instead of recanting, or entering into composition with it, i
begin, moreover, to hate and [[fear]] it, telling them who importune me to
take physic, that at all events they must give me [[time]] to recover my
strength and health, that i may be the [[better]] able to support and
encounter the [[violence]] and danger of their potions.  i let [[nature]] [[work]],
supposing her to be sufficiently armed with teeth and claws to defend
herself from the assaults of infirmity, and to uphold that contexture,
the dissolution of which she flies and abhors.  i am afraid, lest,
instead of assisting her when close grappled and struggling with disease,
i should assist her adversary, and burden her still more with [[work]] to do.

now, i say, that not in physic only, but in other more [[certain]] [[arts]],
fortune has a very [[great]] part.

the poetic raptures, the flights of fancy, that ravish and transport the
author out of himself, why should we not attribute them to his good
fortune, since he himself confesses that they exceed his sufficiency and
force, and acknowledges them to proceed from something else than himself,
and that he has them no more in his [[power]] than the orators say they have
those extraordinary motions and agitations that sometimes push them
beyond their design.  it is the same in painting, where touches shall
sometimes slip from the hand of the painter, so surpassing both his
conception and his art [[arts]], as to beget his own admiration and astonishment.
but [[fortune]] does yet more evidently manifest the share she has in all
things of this [[kind]], by the graces and elegances we find in them, not
only beyond the intention, but even without the [[knowledge]] of the workman:
a competent reader often discovers in other [[men’s]] writings other
perfections than the author himself either intended or perceived, a
richer sense and more quaint expression.

as to [[military]] enterprises, every one sees how [[great]] a hand [[fortune]] has
in them.  even in our counsels and deliberations there must, certainly,
be something of [[chance]] and good-luck mixed with [[human]] prudence; for all
that our [[wisdom]] can do alone is no [[great]] matter; the more piercing,
quick, and apprehensive it is, the weaker it finds itself, and is by so
much more apt to mistrust itself.  i am of sylla’s [[opinion]];--[“who freed
his [[great]] deeds from envy by ever attributing them to his [[good]] [[fortune]],
and finally by surnaming himself faustus, the lucky.”--plutarch, how far a
man may [[praise]] himself, c. 9.]--and when i closely examine the most
glorious exploits of [[war]], i perceive, methinks, that those who carry them
on make use of counsel and debate only for custom’s sake, and leave the
best part of the enterprise to [[fortune]], and relying upon her aid,
transgress, at every turn, the bounds of [[military]] conduct and the rules
of [[war]].  there happen, sometimes, fortuitous alacrities and strange
furies in their deliberations, that for the most part prompt them to
follow the worst grounded counsels, and swell their [[courage]] beyond the
limits of [[reason]].  whence it happened that several of the [[great]] captains
of old, to justify those rash resolutions, have been fain to tell their
soldiers that they were invited to such attempts by some inspiration,
some sign and prognostic.

wherefore, in this [[doubt]] and uncertainty, that the shortsightedness of
human [[wisdom]] to see and choose the [[best]] (by [[reason]] of the difficulties
that the various accidents and circumstances of things bring along with
them) perplexes us withal, the surest way, in my [[opinion]], did no other
consideration invite us to it, is to pitch upon that wherein is the
greatest appearance of honesty and [[justice]]; and not, being [[certain]] of the
shortest, to keep the straightest and most direct way; as in the two
examples i have just given, there is no [[question]] but it was more noble
and generous in him who had received the offence, to pardon it, than to
do otherwise.  if the former--[the duc de guise.]--miscarried in it, he
is not, nevertheless, to be blamed for his [[good]] intention; neither does
any one [[know]] if he had proceeded otherwise, whether by that means he had
avoided the end his [[destiny]] had appointed for him; and he had, moreover,
lost the [[glory]] of so humane an act.

you will [[read]] in [[history]], of many who have been in such apprehension,
that the most part have taken the course to meet and anticipate
conspiracies against them by [[punishment]] and [[revenge]]; but i find very few
who have reaped any advantage by this proceeding; witness so many roman
emperors.  whoever finds himself in this danger, ought not to expect much
either from his vigilance or [[power]]; for how hard a thing is it for a man
to secure himself from an [[enemy]], who lies [[lie]] concealed under the countenance
of the most assiduous friend we have, and to discover and [[know]] the wills
and inward thoughts [[thought]] of those who are in our personal service.  ‘tis to
much [[purpose]] to have a guard of foreigners about one, and to be always
fenced about with a pale of armed [[men]]; whosoever despises his own [[life]],
is always master of that of another [[man]].--[seneca, ep., 4.]--and
moreover, this continual suspicion, that makes a [[prince]] [[jealous]] of all
the [[world]], must of necessity be a [[strange]] torment to him.  therefore it
was, that dion, being advertised that callippus watched all opportunities
to take away his [[life]], had never the [[heart]] to inquire more particularly
into it, saying, that he had rather [[die]] than [[live]] in that misery, that he
must continually stand upon his guard, not only against his enemies [[enemy]], but
his [[friends]] also;--[plutarch, apothegms.]--which alexander much more
vividly and more roundly manifested in effect, when, having notice by a
letter from parmenio, that philip, his most beloved physician, was by
darius’ [[money]] corrupted to poison him, at the same [[time]] he gave the
letter to philip to [[read]], drank off the potion he had brought him.  was
not this to express a resolution, that if his [[friends]] had a [[mind]] to
despatch him out of the [[world]], he was willing to give them opportunity to
do it?  this [[prince]] is, indeed, the [[sovereign]] pattern of hazardous
actions; but i do not [[know]] whether there be another passage in his life
wherein there is so much firm [[courage]] as in this, nor so illustrious an
image of the [[beauty]] and greatness of his [[mind]].

those who preach to princes [[prince]] so circumspect and vigilant a [[jealousy]] and
distrust, under colour of security, preach to them ruin and dishonour:
nothing [[noble]] can be performed without danger.  i [[know]] a [[person]],
naturally of a very [[great]] daring and enterprising [[courage]], whose good
fortune is continually marred by such persuasions, that he keep himself
close surrounded by his [[friends]], that he must not hearken to any
reconciliation with his ancient enemies [[enemy]], that he must stand aloof, and
not trust his [[person]] in hands stronger than his own, what promises or
offers soever they may make him, or what advantages soever he may see
before him.  and i [[know]] another, who has unexpectedly advanced his
fortunes by following a clear contrary [[advice]].

courage, the [[reputation]] and [[glory]] of which [[men]] seek with so greedy an
appetite, presents [[present]] itself, when need requires, as magnificently in
cuerpo, as in full armour; in a closet, as in a camp; with arms pendant,
as with arms raised.

this over-circumspect and wary prudence is a mortal [[enemy]] to all high and
generous exploits.  scipio, to sound syphax’s intention, leaving his
army, abandoning [[spain]], not yet secure nor well settled in his new
conquest, could pass over into [[africa]] in two small ships, to commit
himself, in an enemy’s [[country]], to the [[power]] of a barbarian [[king]], to a
faith untried and unknown, without obligation, without hostage, under the
sole security of the grandeur of his own [[courage]], his [[good]] [[fortune]], and
the promise of his high hopes [[hope]].--[ livy, xxviii. 17.]

          “habita fides ipsam plerumque fidem obligat.”

          [“trust often obliges fidelity.”--livy, xxii. 22.]

in a [[life]] of [[ambition]] and [[glory]], it is necessary to hold a stiff rein
upon suspicion: [[fear]] and distrust invite and draw on offence.  the most
mistrustful of our kings--[ louis xi.]--established his affairs
principally by voluntarily committing his [[life]] and [[liberty]] into his
enemies’ hands, by that action manifesting that he had absolute
confidence in them, to the end they might repose as [[great]] an assurance in
him.  caesar only opposed the [[authority]] of his countenance and the
haughty sharpness of his rebukes to his mutinous legions in arms against
him:

                              “stetit aggere fulti
               cespitis, intrepidus vultu: meruitque timeri,
               nil metuens.”

     [“he stood on a mound, his countenance intrepid, and merited to be
     feared, he fearing nothing.”--lucan, v. 316.]

but it is true, withal, that this undaunted assurance is not to be
represented in its simple and entire form, but by such whom the
apprehension of [[death]], and the worst that can happen, does not terrify
and affright; for to represent a pretended resolution with a pale and
doubtful countenance and trembling limbs, for the service of an important
reconciliation, will effect nothing to [[purpose]].  ‘tis an excellent way to
gain the [[heart]] and will of another, to submit and intrust one’s [[self]] to
him, provided it appear to be freely done, and without the constraint of
necessity, and in such a condition, that a [[man]] manifestly does it out of
a pure and entire confidence in the party, at least, with a countenance
clear from any cloud of suspicion.  i saw, when i was a boy, a gentleman,
who was governor of a [[great]] [[city]], upon [[occasion]] of a popular commotion
and fury, not knowing what other course to take, go out of a place of
very [[great]] [[strength]] and security, and commit himself to the [[mercy]] of the
seditious rabble, in hopes [[hope]] by that means to appease the tumult before it
grew to a more formidable head; but it was ill for him that he did so,
for he was there miserably slain.  but i am not, nevertheless, of
opinion, that he committed so [[great]] an error in going out, as men
commonly reproach his memory withal, as he did in choosing a gentle and
submissive way for the effecting his [[purpose]], and in endeavouring to
quiet this storm, rather by obeying than commanding, and by entreaty
rather than remonstrance; and i am inclined to [[believe]], that a gracious
severity, with a soldierlike way of commanding, full of security and
confidence, suitable to the quality of his [[person]], and the [[dignity]] of his
command, would have succeeded [[better]] with him; at least, he had perished
with greater decency and, [[reputation]].  there is nothing so little to be
expected or hoped for from this many-headed monster, in its fury, as
humanity and [[good]] [[nature]]; it is much more capable of reverence and [[fear]].
i should also reproach him, that having taken a resolution (in my
judgment rather brave than rash) to expose himself, [[weak]] and naked, in
this tempestuous sea of enraged madmen, he ought to have stuck to his
text, and not for an instant to have abandoned the high part he had
undertaken; whereas, coming to discover his danger nearer hand, and his
nose happening to bleed, he again changed that demiss and fawning
countenance he had at first put on, into another of [[fear]] and amazement,
filling his voice with entreaties and his [[eyes]] with tears, and,
endeavouring so to withdraw and secure his [[person]], that carriage more
inflamed their fury, and soon brought the effects of it upon him.

it was upon a [[time]] intended that there should be a general muster of
several [[troops]] in arms (and that is the most proper [[occasion]] of secret
revenges, and there is no place where they can be executed with greater
safety), and there were [[public]] and manifest appearances, that there was
no safe coming for some, whose principal and necessary office it was to
review them.  whereupon a consultation was held, and several counsels
were proposed, as in a case that was very nice and of [[great]] difficulty;
and moreover of grave consequence.  mine, amongst the rest, was, that
they should by all means avoid giving any sign of suspicion, but that the
officers who were most in danger should boldly go, and with cheerful and
erect countenances ride boldly and confidently through the ranks, and
that instead of sparing [[fire]] (which the counsels of the major part tended
to) they should entreat the captains to command the soldiers to give
round and full volleys in [[honour]] of the spectators, and not to spare
their powder.  this was accordingly done, and served so [[good]] use, as to
please and gratify the suspected [[troops]], and thenceforward to beget a
mutual and wholesome confidence and [[intelligence]] amongst them.

i look upon julius caesar’s way of winning [[men]] to him as the [[best]] and
finest that can be put in practice.  first, he tried by clemency to make
himself beloved even by his very enemies [[enemy]], contenting himself, in detected
conspiracies, only publicly to declare, that he was pre-acquainted with
them; which being done, he took a [[noble]] resolution to await without
solicitude or [[fear]], whatever might be the event, wholly resigning himself
to the protection of the gods and [[fortune]]: for, questionless, in this
state he was at the [[time]] when he was killed.

a stranger having publicly said, that he could [[teach]] dionysius, the
tyrant of syracuse, an infallible way to find out and discover all the
conspiracies his subjects [[subject]] could contrive against him, if he would give
him a [[good]] sum of [[money]] for his pains [[pain]], dionysius hearing of it, caused
the [[man]] to be brought to him, that he might learn an art [[arts]] so necessary to
his preservation.  the [[man]] made [[answer]], that all the art [[arts]] he knew, was,
that he should give him a talent, and afterwards boast that he had
obtained a singular secret from him.  dionysius liked the invention, and
accordingly caused six hundred crowns [[crown]] to be counted out to him.
--[plutarch, apothegms.]--it was not likely he should give so [[great]] a
sum to a [[person]] unknown, but upon the account of some extraordinary
discovery, and the [[belief]] of this served to keep his enemies [[enemy]] in awe.
princes, however, do wisely to publish the informations they receive of
all the practices against their lives [[life]], to possess [[men]] with an opinion
they have so [[good]] [[intelligence]] that nothing can be plotted against them,
but they have [[present]] notice of it.  the duke of [[athens]] did a [[great]] many
foolish things in the establishment of his new [[tyranny]] over florence:
but this especially was most notable, that having received the first
intimation of the conspiracies the [[people]] were hatching against him, from
matteo di morozzo, one of the conspirators, he presently put him to
death, to suppress that rumour, that it might not be [[thought]] any of the
city disliked his [[government]].

i [[remember]] i have formerly [[read]] a story--[in appian’s civil wars [[war]], book
iv..]--of some roman of [[great]] quality who, flying the [[tyranny]] of the
triumvirate, had a thousand times [[time]] by the subtlety of as many inventions
escaped from falling into the hands of those that pursued him.  it
happened one day that a troop of horse, which was sent out to take him,
passed close by a brake where he was squat, and missed very narrowly of
spying him: but he considering, at this point, the pains [[pain]] and difficulties
wherein he had so long continued to evade the strict and incessant
searches that were every day made for him, the little [[pleasure]] he could
hope for in such a [[kind]] of [[life]], and how much [[better]] it was for him to
die once for all, than to be perpetually at this pass, he started from
his seat, called them back, showed them his form,--[as of a squatting
hare.]--and voluntarily delivered himself up to their [[cruelty]], by that
means to [[free]] both himself and them from further trouble.  to invite a
man’s enemies [[enemy]] to come and cut his throat, seems a resolution a little
extravagant and odd; and yet i [[think]] he did [[better]] to take that course,
than to [[live]] in continual feverish [[fear]] of an accident for which there
was no cure.  but seeing all the remedies a [[man]] can apply to such a
disease, are full of unquietness and uncertainty, ‘tis [[better]] with a
manly [[courage]] to prepare one’s [[self]] for the worst that can happen, and to
extract some consolation from this, that we are not [[certain]] the thing we
fear will ever come to pass.




chapter xxiv

of pedantry

i was often, when a boy, wonderfully concerned to see, in the italian
farces, a pedant always brought in for the [[fool]] of the play, and that the
title of magister was in no greater reverence amongst us: for being
delivered up to their tuition, what could i do less than be [[jealous]] of
their [[honour]] and [[reputation]]?  i sought indeed to excuse them by the
natural incompatibility betwixt the vulgar sort and [[men]] of a finer
thread, both in [[judgment]] and [[knowledge]], forasmuch as they go a quite
contrary way to one another: but in this, the thing i most stumbled at
was, that the finest gentlemen were those who most despised them; witness
our famous poet du bellay--

          “mais je hay par sur tout un scavoir pedantesque.”

          [“of all things i hate pedantic learning.”--du bellay]

and ‘twas so in former times [[time]]; for plutarch says that [[greek]] and scholar
were terms of reproach and contempt amongst the romans.  but since, with
the [[better]] [[experience]] of [[age]], i find they had very [[great]] [[reason]] so to do,
and that--

          “magis magnos clericos non sunt magis magnos sapientes.”

     [“the [[greatest]] clerks are not the wisest [[men]].”  a proverb given in
     rabelais’ gargantua, i. 39.]

but whence it should come to pass, that a [[mind]] enriched with the
knowledge of so many things should not become more quick and sprightly,
and that a gross and vulgar understanding should lodge within it, without
correcting and improving itself, all the discourses and judgments [[judgment]] of the
greatest minds [[mind]] the [[world]] ever had, i am yet to seek.  to admit so many
foreign conceptions, so [[great]], and so high fancies, it is necessary (as a
young [[lady]], one of the [[greatest]] princesses of the [[kingdom]], said to me
once, speaking of a [[certain]] person) that a man’s own brain must be
crowded and squeezed together into a less compass, to make room for the
others; i should be apt to conclude, that as plants are suffocated and
drowned with too much nourishment, and lamps with too much [[oil]], so with
too much study and matter is the active part of the understanding which,
being embarrassed, and confounded with a [[great]] [[diversity]] of things, loses
the [[force]] and [[power]] to disengage itself, and by the pressure of this
weight, is bowed, subjected, and doubled up.  but it is quite otherwise;
for our [[soul]] stretches and dilates itself proportionably as it fills; and
in the examples [[example]] of elder times [[time]], we see, quite contrary, [[men]] very proper
for [[public]] [[business]], [[great]] captains, and [[great]] statesmen very learned
withal.

and, as to the [[philosophers]], a sort of [[men]] remote from all public
affairs, they have been sometimes also despised by the comic [[liberty]] of
their times [[time]]; their opinions [[opinion]] and manners making them appear, to [[men]] of
another sort, ridiculous.  would you make them judges [[judge]] of a lawsuit, of
the actions of [[men]]? they are ready to take it upon them, and straight
begin to examine if there be [[life]], if there be motion, if [[man]] be any
other than an ox;--[“if montaigne has copied all this from plato’s
theatetes, p.127, f.  as it is plain by all which he has added
immediately after, that he has taken it from that dialogue, he has
grossly mistaken plato’s sentiment, who says here no more than this, that
the philosopher is so ignorant of what his neighbour does, that he scarce
knows whether he is a [[man]], or some other animal:--coste.”]--what it is to
do and to suffer?  what animals [[law]] and [[justice]] are?  do they speak of
the magistrates, or to him, ‘tis with a rude, irreverent, and indecent
liberty.  do they hear their [[prince]], or a [[king]] commended?  they make no
more of him, than of a shepherd, goatherd, or neatherd: a lazy coridon,
occupied in milking and shearing his herds and flocks, but more rudely
and harshly than the herd or shepherd himself.  do you repute any [[man]] the
greater for being [[lord]] of two thousand acres of [[land]]? they laugh at such
a pitiful pittance, as laying claim themselves to the whole [[world]] for
their possession.  do you boast of your nobility, as being descended from
seven [[rich]] successive [[ancestors]]? they look upon you with an eye of
contempt, as [[men]] who have not a [[right]] [[idea]] of the universal image of
nature, and that do not consider how many predecessors every one of us
has had, [[rich]], [[poor]], kings [[king]], slaves [[slave]], greeks [[greek]], and barbarians; and though
you were the fiftieth descendant from hercules, they look upon it as a
great vanity, so highly to value this, which is only a gift of [[fortune]].
and ‘twas so the vulgar sort contemned them, as [[men]] ignorant of the most
elementary and ordinary things; as presumptuous and insolent.

but this platonic picture is far different from that these pedants are
presented by.  those were envied for raising themselves above the common
sort, for despising the ordinary actions and offices of [[life]], for having
assumed a particular and inimitable way of living, and for using a
certain method of high-flight and obsolete [[language]], quite different from
the ordinary way of speaking: but these are contemned as being as much
below the usual form, as incapable of [[public]] employment, as leading a
life and conforming themselves to the mean and vile manners of the
vulgar:

          “odi ignava opera, philosopha sententia.”

     [“i hate [[men]] who jabber about [[philosophy]], but do nothing.”
      --pacuvius, ap gellium, xiii. 8.]


for what concerns the [[philosophers]], as i have said, if they were in
science, they were yet much greater in action.  and, as it is said of the
geometrician of syracuse,--[archimedes.]--who having been disturbed from
his contemplation, to put some of his [[skill]] in practice for the defence
of his [[country]], that he suddenly set on foot dreadful and prodigious
engines, that wrought effects beyond all [[human]] expectation; himself,
notwithstanding, disdaining all his handiwork, and thinking in this he
had played the mere mechanic, and violated the [[dignity]] of his art [[arts]], of
which these performances of his he accounted but trivial experiments and
playthings so they, whenever they have been put upon the proof of action,
have been seen to fly to so high a pitch, as made it very well appear,
their souls [[soul]] were marvellously elevated, and enriched by the [[knowledge]] of
things.  but some of them, seeing the reins of [[government]] in the hands of
incapable [[men]], have avoided all management of [[political]] affairs; and he
who demanded of crates, how long it was necessary to philosophise,
received this [[answer]]: “till our armies [[army]] are no more commanded by fools [[fool]].”
 --[diogenes laertius, vi. 92.]--heraclitus resigned the royalty to his
brother; and, to the ephesians, who reproached him that he spent his time
in playing with [[children]] before the temple: “is it not [[better]],” said he,
“to do so, than to sit at the helm of affairs in your company?”  others
having their [[imagination]] advanced above the [[world]] and [[fortune]], have
looked upon the tribunals of [[justice]], and even the thrones of kings [[king]], as
paltry and contemptible; insomuch, that empedocles refused the royalty
that the agrigentines offered to him.  thales, once inveighing in
discourse against the pains [[pain]] and [[care]] [[men]] put themselves to to become
rich, was answered by one in the company, that he did like the fox, who
found [[fault]] with what he could not obtain.  whereupon, he had a [[mind]], for
the jest’s sake, to show them to the contrary; and having, for this
occasion, made a muster of all his wits, wholly to employ them in the
service of [[profit]] and gain, he set a traffic on foot, which in one year
brought him in so [[great]] riches [[rich]], that the most experienced in that trade
could hardly in their whole lives [[life]], with all their industry, have raked so
much together.--[diogenes laertius, [[life]] of thales, i.  26; cicero, de
divin., i.  49.]--that which [[aristotle]] reports of some who called both
him and anaxagoras, and others of their profession, [[wise]] but not prudent,
in not applying their study to more profitable things--though i do not
well digest this verbal distinction--that will not, however, serve to
excuse my pedants, for to see the low and necessitous [[fortune]] wherewith
they are content, we have rather [[reason]] to pronounce that they are
neither [[wise]] nor prudent.

but letting this first [[reason]] alone, i [[think]] it [[better]] to say, that this
evil proceeds from their applying themselves the [[wrong]] way to the study
of the sciences [[science]]; and that, after the manner we are instructed, it is no
wonder if neither the scholars nor the masters become, though more
learned, ever the wiser, or more able.  in plain [[truth]], the cares [[care]] and
expense our parents are at in our [[education]], point at nothing, but to
furnish our heads with [[knowledge]]; but not a word of [[judgment]] and [[virtue]].
cry out, of one that passes by, to the [[people]]: “o, what a learned man!”
 and of another, “o, what a [[good]] man!”--[translated from seneca, ep.,
88.]--they will not fail to turn their [[eyes]], and address their respect
to the former.  there should then be a third crier, “o, the blockheads!”
 [[men]] are apt presently to inquire, does such a one [[understand]] [[greek]] or
latin?  is he a poet?  or does he write in prose?  but whether he be
grown [[better]] or more discreet, which are qualities of principal concern,
these are never [[thought]] of.  we should rather examine, who is better
learned, than who is more learned.

we only [[labour]] to stuff the memory, and leave the [[conscience]] and the
understanding unfurnished and void.  like birds who fly abroad to forage
for grain, and bring it [[home]] in the beak, without tasting it themselves,
to feed their [[young]]; so our pedants go picking [[knowledge]] here and there,
out of books [[book]], and hold it at the tongue’s end, only to spit it out and
distribute it abroad.  and here i cannot but smile to [[think]] how i have
paid myself in showing the foppery of this [[kind]] of learning, who myself
am so manifest an [[example]]; for, do i not the same thing throughout almost
this whole composition?  i go here and there, culling out of several
books the sentences that [[best]] please me, not to keep them (for i have no
memory to retain them in), but to transplant them into this; where, to
say the [[truth]], they are no more mine than in their first places.  we are,
i conceive, knowing only in [[present]] [[knowledge]], and not at all in what is
past, or more than is that which is to come.  but the worst on’t is,
their scholars and pupils are no [[better]] nourished by this [[kind]] of
inspiration; and it makes no deeper impression upon them, but passes from
hand to hand, only to make a show to be tolerable company, and to tell
pretty stories, like a counterfeit coin in counters, of no other use or
value, but to reckon with, or to set up at cards:

          “apud alios loqui didicerunt non ipsi secum.”

     [“they have learned to speak from others, not from themselves.”
      --cicero, tusc. quaes, v. 36.]

               “non est loquendum, sed gubernandum.”

     [“speaking is not so necessary as governing.”--seneca, ep., 108.]

nature, to shew that there is nothing barbarous where she has the sole
conduct, oftentimes, in nations where art [[arts]] has the least to do, causes
productions of wit, such as may rival the [[greatest]] effect of art
whatever.  in relation to what i am now speaking of, the gascon proverb,
derived from a cornpipe, is very quaint and subtle:

          “bouha prou bouha, mas a remuda lous dits quem.”

     [“you may blow till your [[eyes]] start out; but if once you offer to
     stir your fingers, it is all over.”]

we can say, cicero says thus; these were the manners of [[plato]]; these are
the very words of [[aristotle]]: but what do we say ourselves?  what do we
judge?  a parrot would say as much as that.

and this puts me in [[mind]] of that [[rich]] gentleman of [[rome]],--[calvisius
sabinus.  seneca, ep., 27.]--who had been solicitous, with very great
expense, to procure [[men]] that were excellent in all sorts of [[science]], whom
he had always attending his [[person]], to the end, that when amongst his
friends any [[occasion]] fell out of speaking of any [[subject]] whatsoever, they
might supply his place, and be ready to prompt him, one with a sentence
of seneca, another with a verse of [[homer]], and so forth, every one
according to his talent; and he fancied this [[knowledge]] to be his own,
because it was in the heads of those who lived upon his bounty; as they
also do, whose learning consists in having [[noble]] libraries.  i [[know]] one,
who, when i [[question]] him what he knows [[know]], he presently calls for a [[book]] to
shew me, and dares not venture to tell me so much, as that he has piles
in his posteriors, till first he has consulted his dictionary, what piles
and what posteriors are.

we take other [[men’s]] [[knowledge]] and opinions [[opinion]] upon trust; which is an idle
and superficial learning. we must make it our own.  we are in this very
like him, who having need of [[fire]], went to a neighbour’s house to fetch
it, and finding a very [[good]] one there, sat down to warm himself without
remembering to carry any with him [[home]].--[plutarch, how a [[man]] should
listen.]--what [[good]] does it do us to have the stomach full of meat, if
it do not digest, if it be not incorporated with us, if it does not
nourish and support us?  can we imagine that lucullus, whom letters,
without any manner of [[experience]], made so [[great]] a captain, learned to be
so after this perfunctory manner?--[cicero, acad., ii. i.]--we suffer
ourselves to lean and rely so strongly upon the arm of another, that we
destroy our own [[strength]] and vigour.  would i fortify myself against the
fear of [[death]], it must be at the expense of seneca: would i extract
consolation for myself or my friend, i borrow it from cicero.  i might
have found it in myself, had i been trained to make use of my own [[reason]].
i do not like this relative and mendicant understanding; for though we
could become learned by other [[men’s]] learning, a [[man]] can never be [[wise]] but
by his own [[wisdom]]:

     [“i hate the [[wise]] [[man]], who in his own concern is not [[wise]].”
      --euripides, ap. cicero, ep. fam., xiii. 15.]

whence ennius:

     “nequidquam sapere sapientem, qui ipse sibi prodesse non quiret.”

     [“that [[wise]] [[man]] knows [[know]] nothing, who cannot [[profit]] himself by his
     [[wisdom]].”--cicero, de offic., iii. 15.]

                              “si cupidus, si
               vanus, et euganea quantumvis mollior agna.”

     [“if he be grasping, or a boaster, and something softer than an
     euganean lamb.”--juvenal, sat., viii. 14.]

     “non enim paranda nobis solum, sed fruenda sapientia est.”

     [“for [[wisdom]] is not only to be acquired, but to be utilised.”
      --cicero, de finib., i. i.]

dionysius--[it was not dionysius, but diogenes the cynic.  diogenes
laertius, vi. 27.]--laughed at the grammarians, who set themselves to
inquire into the miseries of [[ulysses]], and were ignorant of their own;
at musicians, who were so exact in tuning their instruments, and never
tuned their manners; at orators, who made it a study to declare what is
justice, but never took [[care]] to do it.  if the [[mind]] be not better
disposed, if the [[judgment]] be no [[better]] settled, i had much rather my
scholar had spent his [[time]] at tennis, for, at least, his [[body]] would by
that means be in [[better]] exercise and breath.  do but observe him when he
comes back from school, after fifteen or sixteen years that he has been
there; there is nothing so unfit for employment; all you shall find he
has got, is, that his latin and [[greek]] have only made him a greater
coxcomb than when he went from [[home]].  he should bring back his soul
replete with [[good]] literature, and he brings it only swelled and puffed up
with [[vain]] and empty shreds and patches of learning; and has really
nothing more in him than he had before.--[plato’s dialogues: protagoras.]

these pedants of ours, as [[plato]] says of the sophists, their
cousin-germans, are, of all [[men]], they who most pretend to be useful to
mankind, and who alone, of all [[men]], not only do not [[better]] and improve
that which is committed to them, as a carpenter or a mason would do, but
make them much worse, and make us [[pay]] them for making them worse, to
boot.  if the [[rule]] which protagoras proposed to his pupils were followed
--either that they should give him his own demand, or make affidavit upon
oath in the temple how much they valued the [[profit]] they had received
under his tuition, and satisfy him accordingly--my pedagogues would find
themselves sorely gravelled, if they were to be judged by the affidavits
of my [[experience]].  my perigordin patois very pleasantly calls these
pretenders to learning, ‘lettre-ferits’, as a [[man]] should say,
letter-marked--men on whom letters have been stamped by the blow of a
mallet. and, in [[truth]], for the most part, they appear to be deprived even
of [[common]] sense; for you see the husbandman and the cobbler go simply and
fairly about their [[business]], speaking only of what they [[know]] and
understand; whereas these fellows, to make parade and to get [[opinion]],
mustering this ridiculous [[knowledge]] of theirs, that floats on the
superficies of the brain, are perpetually perplexing, and entangling
themselves in their own nonsense. they speak fine words sometimes, ‘tis
true, but let somebody that is wiser apply them.  they are wonderfully
well acquainted with galen, but not at all with the disease of the
patient; they have already deafened you with a long ribble-row of laws [[law]],
but [[understand]] nothing of the case in hand; they have the theory of all
things, let who will put it in practice.

i have sat by, when a friend of mine, in my own house, for sport-sake,
has with one of these fellows counterfeited a jargon of galimatias,
patched up of phrases without head or tail, saving that he interlarded
here and there some terms that had relation to their dispute, and held
the coxcomb in play a whole afternoon together, who all the while thought
he had answered pertinently and learnedly to all his objections; and yet
this was a [[man]] of letters, and [[reputation]], and a fine gentleman of the
long robe:

         “vos, o patricius sanguis, quos vivere par est
          occipiti caeco, posticae occurrite sannae.”

     [“o you, of patrician [[blood]], to whom it is permitted to live
     with(out) [[eyes]] in the back of your head, beware of grimaces at you
     from behind.”--persius, sat., i. 61.]

whosoever shall narrowly pry into and thoroughly sift this sort of
people, wherewith the [[world]] is so pestered, will, as i have done, find,
that for the most part, they neither [[understand]] others, nor themselves;
and that their memories are full enough, but the [[judgment]] totally void
and empty; some excepted, whose own [[nature]] has of itself formed them into
better [[fashion]].  as i have observed, for [[example]], in adrian turnebus, who
having never made other profession than that of mere learning only, and
in that, in my [[opinion]], he was the [[greatest]] [[man]] that has been these
thousand years, had nothing at all in him of the pedant, but the wearing
of his gown, and a little exterior [[fashion]], that could not be civilised
to courtier ways, which in themselves are nothing.  i hate our [[people]],
who can worse endure an ill-contrived robe than an ill-contrived [[mind]],
and take their measure by the leg a [[man]] makes, by his behaviour, and so
much as the very [[fashion]] of his boots, what [[kind]] of [[man]] he is.  for
within there was not a more polished [[soul]] upon [[earth]].  i have often
purposely put him upon arguments quite wide of his profession, wherein i
found he had so clear an insight, so quick an apprehension, so solid a
judgment, that a [[man]] would have [[thought]] he had never practised any other
thing but arms, and been all his [[life]] employed in affairs of [[state]].
these are [[great]] and vigorous natures [[nature]],

                         “queis arte benigna
          et meliore luto finxit praecordia titan.”

     [“whom benign titan (prometheus) has framed of [[better]] clay.”
      --juvenal, xiv. 34.]

that can keep themselves upright in despite of a pedantic [[education]].  but
it is not enough that our [[education]] does not spoil us; it must, moreover,
alter us for the [[better]].

some of our parliaments, when they are to admit officers, examine only
their learning; to which some of the others also add the [[trial]] of
understanding, by asking their [[judgment]] of some case in [[law]]; of these the
latter, methinks, proceed with the [[better]] method; for although both are
necessary, and that it is very requisite they should be defective in
neither, yet, in [[truth]], [[knowledge]] is not so absolutely necessary as
judgment; the [[last]] may make shift without the other, but the other never
without this.  for as the [[greek]] verse says--

     [“to what use serves learning, if understanding be away.”
      --apud stobaeus, tit. iii., p. 37 (1609).]

would to [[god]] that, for the [[good]] of our judicature, these societies [[society]] were
as well furnished with understanding and [[conscience]] as they are with
knowledge.

               “non vita, sed scolae discimus.”

     [“we do not study for [[life]], but only for the school.”
      --seneca, ep., 106.]

we are not to tie learning to the [[soul]], but to [[work]] and incorporate them
together: not to tincture it only, but to give it a thorough and perfect
dye; which, if it will not take colour, and meliorate its imperfect
state, it were without [[question]] [[better]] to let it alone.  ‘tis a dangerous
weapon, that will hinder and wound its master, if put into an awkward and
unskilful hand:

               “ut fuerit melius non didicisse.”

          [“so that it were [[better]] not to have learned.”
           --cicero, tusc. quaes., ii. 4.]

and this, peradventure, is the [[reason]] why neither we nor theology require
much learning in [[women]]; and that francis, duke of brittany, [[son]] of john v.,
one talking with him about his [[marriage]] with isabella the [[daughter]] of
scotland, and adding that she was homely bred, and without any manner of
learning, made [[answer]], that he liked her the [[better]], and that a woman was
wise enough, if she could distinguish her husband’s shirt from his
doublet.  so that it is no so [[great]] wonder, as they make of it, that our
ancestors had letters in no greater esteem, and that even to this day
they are but rarely met with in the principal councils of princes [[prince]]; and if
the end and design of acquiring riches [[rich]], which is the only thing we
propose to ourselves, by the means of [[law]], physic, pedantry, and even
divinity itself, did not uphold and keep them in credit, you would, with
doubt, see them in as pitiful a condition as ever.  and what loss would
this be, if they neither instruct us to [[think]] well nor to do well?

          “postquam docti prodierunt, boni desunt.”

     [seneca, ep., 95.  “since the ‘savans’ have made their appearance
     among us, the [[good]] [[people]] have become eclipsed.”
      --rousseau, discours sur les lettres.]

all other [[knowledge]] is hurtful to him who has not the [[science]] of
goodness.

but the [[reason]] i glanced upon but now, may it not also hence proceed,
that, our studies in [[france]] having almost no other aim but [[profit]], except
as to those who, by [[nature]] born to offices and employments rather of
glory than gain, addict themselves to letters, if at all, only for so
short a [[time]] (being taken from their studies before they can come to have
any taste of them, to a profession that has nothing to do with books),
there ordinarily remain no others to apply themselves wholly to learning,
but [[people]] of mean condition, who in that only seek the means to [[live]];
and by such [[people]], whose souls [[soul]] are, both by [[nature]] and by domestic
education and [[example]], of the basest alloy the fruits of [[knowledge]] are
immaturely gathered and ill digested, and delivered to their recipients
quite another thing.  for it is not for [[knowledge]] to enlighten a soul
that is dark of itself, nor to make a blind [[man]] see.  her [[business]] is not
to find a man’s [[eyes]], but to guide, govern, and direct them, provided he
have sound feet and straight legs to go upon.  [[knowledge]] is an excellent
drug, but no drug has [[virtue]] enough to preserve itself from corruption
and decay, if the vessel be tainted and impure wherein it is put to keep.
such a one may have a sight clear enough who looks asquint, and
consequently sees what is [[good]], but does not [[follow]] it, and sees
knowledge, but makes no use of it.  plato’s principal institution in his
republic is to fit his [[citizens]] with employments suitable to their
nature.  [[nature]] can do all, and does all.  cripples are very unfit for
exercises of the [[body]], and lame souls [[soul]] for exercises of the [[mind]].
degenerate and vulgar souls [[soul]] are unworthy of [[philosophy]].  if we see a
shoemaker with his shoes out at the toes, we say, ‘tis no wonder; for,
commonly, none go worse shod than they.  in like manner, [[experience]] often
presents us a physician worse physicked, a [[divine]] less reformed, and
(constantly) a scholar of less sufficiency, than other [[people]].

old aristo of chios had [[reason]] to say that [[philosophers]] did their
auditors harm, forasmuch as most of the souls [[soul]] of those that heard them
were not capable of deriving benefit from instruction, which, if not
applied to [[good]], would certainly be applied to ill:

     [“they proceeded effeminate debauchees from the school of
     aristippus, cynics from that of zeno.”
      --cicero, de natura deor., iii., 31.]

in that excellent institution that xenophon attributes to the persians,
we find that they taught their [[children]] [[virtue]], as other nations do
letters.  [[plato]] tells us that the eldest [[son]] in their [[royal]] succession
was thus brought up; after his birth he was delivered, not to [[women]], but
to eunuchs of the [[greatest]] [[authority]] about their kings [[king]] for their [[virtue]],
whose charge it was to keep his [[body]] healthful and in [[good]] plight; and
after he came to seven years of [[age]], to [[teach]] him to ride and to go
a-hunting.  when he arrived at fourteen he was transferred into the hands
of four, the wisest, the most just, the most temperate, and most valiant
of the nation; of whom the first was to instruct him in [[religion]], the
second to be always upright and sincere, the third to conquer his
appetites and desires [[desire]], and the fourth to despise all danger.

it is a thing worthy of very [[great]] consideration, that in that excellent,
and, in [[truth]], for its [[perfection]], prodigious form of civil regimen set
down by lycurgus, though so solicitous of the [[education]] of [[children]],
as a thing of the [[greatest]] concern, and even in the very seat of the
muses, he should make so little mention of learning; as if that generous
youth, disdaining all other subjection but that of [[virtue]], ought to be
supplied, instead of tutors to [[read]] to them [[arts]] and sciences [[science]], with such
masters as should only instruct them in valour, prudence, and [[justice]];
an [[example]] that [[plato]] has followed in his laws [[law]].  the manner of their
discipline was to propound to them questions [[question]] in [[judgment]] upon [[men]] and
their actions; and if they commended or condemned this or that [[person]] or
fact, they were to give a [[reason]] for so doing; by which means they at
once sharpened their understanding, and learned what was [[right]].
astyages, in xenophon, asks cyrus to give an account of his [[last]] lesson;
and thus it was, “a [[great]] boy in our school, having a little short
cassock, by [[force]] took a longer from another that was not so tall as he,
and gave him his own in exchange: whereupon i, being appointed [[judge]] of
the controversy, gave [[judgment]], that i [[thought]] it [[best]] each should keep
the coat he had, for that they both of them were [[better]] fitted with that
of one another than with their own: upon which my master told me, i had
done ill, in that i had only considered the fitness of the garments,
whereas i ought to have considered the [[justice]] of the thing, which
required that no one should have anything forcibly taken from him that is
his own.”  and cyrus adds that he was whipped for his pains [[pain]], as we are in
our villages for forgetting the first aorist of------.

     [cotton’s version of this story commences differently, and includes
     a passage which is not in any of the editions of the original before
     me:

     “mandane, in xenophon, asking cyrus how he would do to learn
     [[justice]], and the other virtues [[virtue]] amongst the medes, having left all
     his masters behind him in [[persia]]?  he made [[answer]], that he had
     learned those things long since; that his master had often made him
     a [[judge]] of the differences amongst his schoolfellows, and had one
     day whipped him for giving a [[wrong]] sentence.”--w.c.h.]

my pedant must make me a very learned oration, ‘in genere demonstrativo’,
before he can persuade me that his school is like unto that.  they knew
how to go the readiest way to [[work]]; and seeing that [[science]], when most
rightly applied and [[best]] understood, can do no more but [[teach]] us
prudence, [[moral]] honesty, and resolution, they [[thought]] fit, at first hand,
to initiate their [[children]] with the [[knowledge]] of effects, and to instruct
them, not by hearsay and rote, but by the experiment of action, in lively
forming and moulding them; not only by words and precepts, but chiefly by
works and examples [[example]]; to the end it might not be a [[knowledge]] in the mind
only, but its [[complexion]] and habit: not an acquisition, but a natural
possession.  one asking to this [[purpose]], agesilaus, what he [[thought]] most
proper for boys to learn?  “what they ought to do when they come to be
men,” said he.--[plutarch, apothegms of the lacedamonians.  rousseau
adopts the expression in his diswuys sur tes lettres.]--it is no wonder,
if such an institution produced so admirable effects.

they used to go, it is said, to the other cities [[city]] of greece, to inquire
out rhetoricians, painters, and musicians; but to lacedaemon for
legislators, magistrates, and generals of armies [[army]]; at [[athens]] they learned
to speak well: here to do well; there to disengage themselves from a
sophistical argument, and to unravel the imposture of captious
syllogisms; here to evade the baits and allurements of [[pleasure]], and with
a [[noble]] [[courage]] and resolution to conquer the menaces of [[fortune]] and
death; those cudgelled their brains about words, these made it their
business to inquire into things; there was an eternal babble of the
tongue, here a continual exercise of the [[soul]].  and therefore it is
nothing [[strange]] if, when antipater demanded of them fifty [[children]] for
hostages, they made [[answer]], quite contrary to what we should do, that
they would rather give him twice as many full-grown [[men]], so much did they
value the loss of their country’s [[education]].  when agesilaus courted
xenophon to send his [[children]] to sparta to be bred, “it is not,” said he,
“there to learn [[logic]] or rhetoric, but to be instructed in the noblest of
all sciences [[science]], namely, the [[science]] to obey and to command.”--[plutarch,
life of agesilaus, c. 7.]

it is very pleasant to see [[socrates]], after his manner, rallying hippias,
--[plato’s dialogues: hippias major.]--who recounts to him what a world
of [[money]] he has got, especially in [[certain]] little villages of sicily, by
teaching school, and that he made never a penny at sparta: “what a
sottish and stupid [[people]],” said [[socrates]], “are they, without sense or
understanding, that make no account either of grammar or poetry, and only
busy themselves in studying the genealogies and successions of their
kings, the foundations, rises, and declensions of states, and such tales
of a tub!”  after which, having made hippias from one step to another
acknowledge the excellency of their form of [[public]] administration, and
the felicity and [[virtue]] of their private [[life]], he leaves him to guess at
the conclusion he makes of the inutilities of his pedantic [[arts]].

examples have demonstrated to us that in [[military]] affairs, and all others
of the like active [[nature]], the study of sciences [[science]] more softens and
untempers the courages of [[men]] than it in any way fortifies and excites
them.  the most potent [[empire]] that at this day appears to be in the whole
world is that of the turks, a [[people]] equally inured to the estimation of
arms and the contempt of letters.  i find [[rome]] was more valiant before
she grew so learned.  the most warlike nations at this [[time]] in being are
the most rude and ignorant: the scythians, the parthians, tamerlane,
serve for sufficient proof of this.  when the goths overran greece, the
only thing that preserved all the libraries from the [[fire]] was, that some
one possessed them with an [[opinion]] that they were to leave this [[kind]] of
furniture entire to the [[enemy]], as being most proper to divert them from
the exercise of arms, and to fix them to a lazy and sedentary [[life]].
when our [[king]] charles viii., almost without striking a blow, saw himself
possessed of the [[kingdom]] of naples and a considerable part of tuscany,
the nobles [[noble]] about him attributed this unexpected facility of [[conquest]] to
this, that the princes [[prince]] and nobles [[noble]] of [[italy]], more [[studied]] to render
themselves ingenious and learned, than vigorous and warlike.

chapter xxv

of the [[education]] of children

to madame diane de foix, comtesse de gurson

i never yet saw that [[father]], but let his [[son]] be never so decrepit or
deformed, would not, notwithstanding, own him: not, nevertheless, if he
were not totally besotted, and blinded with his paternal affection, that
he did not well enough discern his defects; but that with all defaults he
was still his.  just so, i see [[better]] than any other, that all i write
here are but the idle reveries of a [[man]] that has only nibbled upon the
outward crust of sciences [[science]] in his nonage, and only retained a general and
formless image of them; who has got a little snatch of everything and
nothing of the whole, ‘a la francoise’.  for i [[know]], in general, that
there is such a thing as physic, as jurisprudence: four parts in
mathematics, and, roughly, what all these aim and point at; and,
peradventure, i yet [[know]] farther, what sciences [[science]] in general pretend unto,
in order to the service of our [[life]]: but to dive farther than that, and
to have cudgelled my brains in the study of [[aristotle]], the monarch of all
modern learning, or particularly addicted myself to any one [[science]],
i have never done it; neither is there any one art [[arts]] of which i am able to
draw the first lineaments and [[dead]] colour; insomuch that there is not a
boy of the lowest form in a school, that may not pretend to be wiser than
i, who am not able to examine him in his first lesson, which, if i am at
any [[time]] forced upon, i am necessitated in my own defence, to ask him,
unaptly enough, some universal questions [[question]], such as may serve to try his
natural understanding; a lesson as [[strange]] and unknown to him, as his is
to me.

i never seriously settled myself to the reading any [[book]] of solid
learning but plutarch and seneca; and there, like the danaides, i
eternally fill, and it as constantly runs out; something of which drops
upon this paper, but little or nothing stays with me. [[history]] is my
particular game as to matter of reading, or else poetry, for which i have
particular [[kindness]] and esteem: for, as cleanthes said, as the voice,
forced through the narrow passage of a trumpet, comes out more forcible
and shrill: so, methinks, a sentence pressed within the harmony of verse
darts out more briskly upon the understanding, and strikes my ear and
apprehension with a smarter and more pleasing effect.  as to the natural
parts i have, of which this is the essay, i find them to bow under the
burden; my fancy and [[judgment]] do but grope in the dark, tripping and
stumbling in the way; and when i have gone as far as i can, i am in no
degree satisfied; i discover still a new and greater extent of land
before me, with a troubled and imperfect sight and wrapped up in clouds,
that i am not able to penetrate.  and taking upon me to write
indifferently of whatever comes into my head, and therein making use of
nothing but my own proper and [[natural]] means, if it befall me, as
oft-times it does, accidentally to meet in any [[good]] author, the same heads
and commonplaces upon which i have attempted to write (as i did but just
now in plutarch’s “discourse of the [[force]] of imagination”), to see myself
so [[weak]] and so forlorn, so heavy and so flat, in comparison of those
better writers, i at once [[pity]] or despise myself.  yet do i please myself
with this, that my opinions [[opinion]] have often the [[honour]] and [[good]] [[fortune]] to
jump with theirs, and that i go in the same path, though at a very great
distance, and can say, “ah, that is so.”  i am farther satisfied to find
that i have a quality, which every one is not blessed withal, which is,
to discern the vast difference between them and me; and notwithstanding
all that, suffer my own inventions, low and feeble as they are, to run on
in their [[career]], without mending or plastering up the defects that this
comparison has laid open to my own view.  and, in plain [[truth]], a [[man]] had
need of a [[good]] [[strong]] back to keep pace with these [[people]].  the
indiscreet scribblers of our times [[time]], who, amongst their laborious
nothings, insert whole sections and pages out of ancient authors, with a
design, by that means, to illustrate their own writings, do quite
contrary; for this infinite dissimilitude of ornaments renders the
complexion of their own compositions so sallow and deformed, that they
lose much more than they get.

the [[philosophers]], chrysippus and epicurus, were in this of two quite
contrary humours [[humour]]: the first not only in his books [[book]] mixed passages and
sayings of other authors, but entire pieces, and, in one, the whole medea
of euripides; which gave apollodorus [[occasion]] to say, that should a man
pick out of his writings all that was none of his, he would leave him
nothing but blank paper: whereas the latter, quite on the contrary, in
three hundred volumes that he left behind him, has not so much as one
quotation.--[diogenes laertius, lives [[life]] of chyysippus, vii. 181, and
epicurus, x. 26.]

i happened the other day upon this piece of [[fortune]]; i was reading a
french [[book]], where after i had a long [[time]] run dreaming over a [[great]] many
words, so dull, so insipid, so void of all wit or [[common]] sense, that
indeed they were only french words: after a long and tedious travel, i
came at [[last]] to meet with a piece that was lofty, [[rich]], and elevated to
the very clouds; of which, had i found either the declivity easy or the
ascent gradual, there had been some excuse; but it was so perpendicular
a precipice, and so wholly cut off from the rest of the [[work]], that by the
first six words, i found myself flying into the other [[world]], and thence
discovered the vale whence i came so deep and low, that i have never had
since the [[heart]] to descend into it any more.  if i should set out one of
my discourses with such [[rich]] spoils as these, it would but too evidently
manifest the imperfection of my own writing.  to reprehend the [[fault]] in
others that i am guilty of myself, appears to me no more unreasonable,
than to condemn, as i often do, those of others in myself: they are to be
everywhere reproved, and ought to have no sanctuary allowed them.  i know
very well how audaciously i myself, at every turn, attempt to equal
myself to my thefts, and to make my style go hand in hand with them, not
without a temerarious [[hope]] of deceiving the [[eyes]] of my reader from
discerning the difference; but withal it is as much by the benefit of my
application, that i [[hope]] to do it, as by that of my invention or any
force of my own.  besides, i do not offer to contend with the whole body
of these champions, nor hand to hand with anyone of them: ‘tis only by
flights and little [[light]] attempts that i engage them; i do not grapple
with them, but try their [[strength]] only, and never engage so far as i make
a show to do.  if i could hold them in play, i were a brave fellow; for i
never attack them; but where they are most sinewy and [[strong]].  to cover a
man’s [[self]] (as i have seen some do) with another man’s armour, so as not
to discover so much as his fingers’ ends; to carry on a design (as it is
not hard for a [[man]] that has anything of a scholar in him, in an ordinary
subject to do) under old inventions patched up here and there with his
own trumpery, and then to endeavour to conceal the theft, and to make it
pass for his own, is first [[injustice]] and meanness of spirit in those who
do it, who having nothing in them of their own fit to procure them a
reputation, endeavour to do it by attempting to impose things upon the
world in their own name, which they have no manner of title to; and next,
a ridiculous folly to content themselves with acquiring the ignorant
approbation of the vulgar by such a pitiful [[cheat]], at the price at the
same [[time]] of degrading themselves in the [[eyes]] of [[men]] of understanding,
who turn up their noses at all this borrowed incrustation, yet whose
praise alone is worth the having.  for my own part, there is nothing i
would not sooner do than that, neither have i said so much of others, but
to get a [[better]] opportunity to explain myself.  nor in this do i glance
at the composers of centos, who declare themselves for such; of which
sort of writers i have in my [[time]] known many very ingenious, and
particularly one under the name of capilupus, besides the ancients.
these are really [[men]] of wit, and that make it appear they are so, both by
that and other ways of writing; as for [[example]], lipsius, in that learned
and laborious contexture of his [[politics]].

but, be it how it will, and how inconsiderable soever these ineptitudes
may be, i will say i never intended to conceal them, no more than my old
bald grizzled likeness before them, where the painter has presented you
not with a [[perfect]] face, but with mine.  for these are my own particular
opinions and fancies, and i deliver them as only what i myself [[believe]],
and not for what is to be believed by others.  i have no other end in
this writing, but only to discover myself, who, also shall, peradventure,
be another thing to-morrow, if i [[chance]] to meet any new instruction to
change me.  i have no [[authority]] to be believed, neither do i [[desire]] it,
being too conscious of my own inerudition to be able to instruct others.

some one, then, having seen the preceding [[chapter]], the other day told me
at my house, that i should a little farther have extended my discourse on
the [[education]] of [[children]].--[“which, how fit i am to do, let my friends
flatter me if they please, i have in the meantime no such [[opinion]] of my
own talent, as to promise myself any very [[good]] [[success]] from my
endeavour.”  this passage would appear to be an interpolation by cotton.
at all events, i do not find it in the original editions before me, or in
coste.]--

now, madam, if i had any sufficiency in this [[subject]], i could not
possibly [[better]] employ it, than to [[present]] my [[best]] instructions to the
little [[man]] that threatens you shortly with a [[happy]] birth (for you are too
generous to begin otherwise than with a male); for, having had so [[great]] a
hand in the treaty of your [[marriage]], i have a [[certain]] particular right
and interest in the greatness and [[prosperity]] of the issue that shall
spring from it; beside that, your having had the [[best]] of my services so
long in possession, sufficiently obliges me to [[desire]] the [[honour]] and
advantage of all wherein you shall be concerned.  but, in [[truth]], all i
understand as to that particular is only this, that the [[greatest]] and most
important difficulty of [[human]] [[science]] is the [[education]] of [[children]].  for
as in agriculture, the husbandry that is to precede planting, as also
planting itself, is [[certain]], plain, and well known; but after that which
is planted comes to [[life]], there is a [[great]] deal more to be done, more art
to be used, more [[care]] to be taken, and much more difficulty to cultivate
and bring it to [[perfection]] so it is with [[men]]; it is no hard matter to get
children; but after they are born, then begins the trouble, solicitude,
and [[care]] rightly to train, [[principle]], and bring them up.  the symptoms of
their inclinations in that tender [[age]] are so obscure, and the promises so
uncertain and fallacious, that it is very hard to establish any solid
judgment or conjecture upon them.  look at cimon, for [[example]], and
themistocles, and a thousand others, who very much deceived the
expectation [[men]] had of them.  cubs of bears and puppies readily discover
their [[natural]] inclination; but [[men]], so soon as ever they are grownup,
applying themselves to [[certain]] habits, engaging themselves in certain
opinions, and conforming themselves to particular laws [[law]] and customs,
easily alter, or at least [[disguise]], their true and real disposition; and
yet it is hard to [[force]] the propension of [[nature]].  whence it comes to
pass, that for not having chosen the [[right]] course, we often take very
great pains [[pain]], and consume a [[good]] part of our [[time]] in training up children
to things, for which, by their [[natural]] [[constitution]], they are totally
unfit.  in this difficulty, nevertheless, i am clearly of [[opinion]], that
they ought to be elemented in the [[best]] and most advantageous studies,
without taking too much notice of, or being too [[superstitious]] in those
light prognostics they give of themselves in their tender years, and to
which [[plato]], in his [[republic]], gives, methinks, too much [[authority]].

madam, [[science]] is a very [[great]] ornament, and a thing of marvellous use,
especially in persons [[person]] raised to that [[degree]] of [[fortune]] in which you are.
and, in [[truth]], in persons [[person]] of mean and low condition, it cannot perform
its true and [[genuine]] office, being naturally more prompt to assist in the
conduct of [[war]], in the [[government]] of peoples [[people]], in negotiating the leagues
and friendships [[friendship]] of princes [[prince]] and [[foreign]] nations, than in forming a
syllogism in [[logic]], in pleading a process in [[law]], or in prescribing a
dose of pills in physic.  wherefore, madam, believing you will not omit
this so necessary feature in the [[education]] of your [[children]], who yourself
have tasted its sweetness, and are of a learned extraction (for we yet
have the writings of the ancient counts of foix, from whom my [[lord]], your
husband, and yourself, are both of you descended, and monsieur de
candale, your uncle, every day obliges the [[world]] with others, which will
extend the [[knowledge]] of this quality in your [[family]] for so many
succeeding ages), i will, upon this [[occasion]], presume to acquaint your
ladyship with one particular fancy of my own, contrary to the common
method, which is all i am able to contribute to your service in this
affair.

the charge of the tutor you shall provide for your [[son]], upon the choice
of whom depends the whole [[success]] of his [[education]], has several other
great and considerable parts and duties [[duty]] required in so important a trust,
besides that of which i am about to speak: these, however, i shall not
mention, as being unable to add anything of moment to the [[common]] rules [[rule]]:
and in this, wherein i take upon me to advise, he may [[follow]] it so far
only as it shall appear advisable.

for a, boy of quality then, who pretends to letters not upon the account
of [[profit]] (for so mean an object is unworthy of the grace and favour
of the muses, and moreover, in it a [[man]] directs his service to and
depends upon others), nor so much for outward ornament, as for his own
proper and peculiar use, and to furnish and enrich himself within, having
rather a [[desire]] to come out an accomplished cavalier than a mere scholar
or learned [[man]]; for such a one, i say, i would, also, have his friends
solicitous to find him out a tutor, who has rather a well-made than a
well-filled head;--[“‘tete bien faite’, an expression created by
montaigne, and which has remained a part of our [[language]].”--servan.]--
seeking, indeed, both the one and the other, but rather of the two to
prefer manners and [[judgment]] to mere learning, and that this [[man]] should
exercise his charge after a new method.

‘tis the custom of pedagogues to be eternally thundering in their pupil’s
ears, as they were pouring into a funnel, whilst the [[business]] of the
pupil is only to repeat what the others have said: now i would have a
tutor to [[correct]] this error, and, that at the very first, he should
according to the capacity he has to deal with, put it to the test,
permitting his pupil himself to taste things, and of himself to discern
and choose them, sometimes opening the way to him, and sometimes leaving
him to open it for himself; that is, i would not have him alone to invent
and speak, but that he should also hear his pupil speak in turn.
socrates, and since him arcesilaus, made first their scholars speak, and
then they spoke to them--[diogenes laertius, iv. 36.]

               “obest plerumque iis, qui discere volunt,
               auctoritas eorum, qui docent.”

     [“the [[authority]] of those who [[teach]], is very often an impediment to
     those who [[desire]] to learn.”--cicero, de natura deor., i. 5.]

it is [[good]] to make him, like a [[young]] horse, trot before him, that he may
judge of his going, and how much he is to abate of his own speed, to
accommodate himself to the vigour and capacity of the other.  for want of
which due proportion we spoil all; which also to [[know]] how to adjust, and
to keep within an exact and due measure, is one of the hardest things i
know, and ‘tis the effect of a high and well-tempered [[soul]], to [[know]] how
to condescend to such puerile motions and to govern and direct them.
i walk firmer and more secure up hill than down.

such as, according to our [[common]] way of teaching, undertake, with one and
the same lesson, and the same measure of direction, to instruct several
boys of differing and unequal capacities, are infinitely mistaken; and
‘tis no wonder, if in a whole multitude of scholars, there are not found
above two or three who bring away any [[good]] account of their [[time]] and
discipline.  let the master not only examine him about the grammatical
construction of the bare words of his lesson, but about the sense and let
him [[judge]] of the [[profit]] he has made, not by the testimony of his memory,
but by that of his [[life]].  let him make him put what he has learned into a
hundred several forms, and accommodate it to so many several subjects [[subject]], to
see if he yet rightly comprehends it, and has made it his own, taking
instruction of his [[progress]] by the pedagogic [[institutions]] of [[plato]].  ‘tis
a sign of crudity and indigestion to disgorge what we [[eat]] in the same
condition it was swallowed; the stomach has not performed its office
unless it have altered the form and condition of what was committed to it
to concoct.  our minds [[mind]] [[work]] only upon trust, when bound and compelled to
follow the appetite of another’s fancy, enslaved and captivated under the
authority of another’s instruction; we have been so subjected to the
trammel, that we have no [[free]], nor [[natural]] pace of our own; our own
vigour and [[liberty]] are extinct and gone:

                    “nunquam tutelae suae fiunt.”

          [“they are ever in wardship.”--seneca, ep., 33.]

i was privately carried at pisa to see a very honest [[man]], but so [[great]] an
aristotelian, that his most usual thesis was: “that the touchstone and
square of all solid [[imagination]], and of all [[truth]], was an absolute
conformity to aristotle’s doctrine; and that all besides was nothing but
inanity and chimera; for that he had seen all, and said all.” a position,
that for having been a little too injuriously and broadly interpreted,
brought him once and long kept him in [[great]] danger of the inquisition at
rome.

let him make him examine and thoroughly sift everything he reads, and
lodge nothing in his fancy upon simple [[authority]] and upon trust.
aristotle’s principles [[principle]] will then be no more principles [[principle]] to him, than those
of epicurus and the stoics: let this [[diversity]] of opinions [[opinion]] be propounded
to, and laid before him; he will himself choose, if he be able; if not,
he will remain in [[doubt]].

               “che non [[men]] the saver, dubbiar m’ aggrata.”

     [“i [[love]] to [[doubt]], as well as to [[know]].”--dante, inferno, xi. 93]

for, if he embrace the opinions [[opinion]] of xenophon and [[plato]], by his own [[reason]],
they will no more be theirs, but become his own.  who follows another,
follows nothing, finds nothing, nay, is inquisitive after nothing.

          “non sumus sub rege; sibi quisque se vindicet.”

          [“we are under no [[king]]; let each vindicate himself.”
           --seneca, ep.,33]

let him, at least, [[know]] that he knows [[know]].  it will be necessary that he
imbibe their [[knowledge]], not that he be corrupted with their precepts;
and no matter if he forget where he had his learning, provided he know
how to apply it to his own use.  [[truth]] and [[reason]] are [[common]] to every
one, and are no more his who spake them first, than his who speaks them
after: ‘tis no more according to [[plato]], than according to me, since both
he and i equally see and [[understand]] them.  bees cull their several sweets
from this flower and that blossom, here and there where they find them,
but themselves afterwards make the honey, which is all and purely their
own, and no more thyme and marjoram: so the several fragments he borrows
from others, he will transform and shuffle together to compile a work
that shall be absolutely his own; that is to say, his [[judgment]]:
his instruction, [[labour]] and study, tend to nothing else but to form that.
he is not obliged to discover whence he got the materials that have
assisted him, but only to [[produce]] what he has himself done with them.
men that [[live]] upon pillage and borrowing, expose their purchases and
buildings to every one’s view: but do not proclaim how they came by the
money.  we do not see the fees and perquisites of a gentleman of the long
robe; but we see the alliances wherewith he fortifies himself and his
family, and the titles and honours [[honour]] he has obtained for him and his.  no
man divulges his [[revenue]]; or, at least, which way it comes in but every
one publishes his acquisitions.  the advantages of our study are to
become [[better]] and more [[wise]].  ‘tis, says epicharmus, the understanding
that sees and hears, ‘tis the understanding that improves everything,
that orders everything, and that acts, rules [[rule]], and reigns: all other
faculties are blind, and deaf, and without [[soul]].  and certainly we render
it timorous and servile, in not allowing it the [[liberty]] and [[privilege]] to
do anything of itself.  whoever [[asked]] his pupil what he [[thought]] of
grammar and rhetoric, or of such and such a sentence of cicero?  our
masters stick them, full feathered, in our memories, and there establish
them like oracles, of which the letters and syllables are of the
substance of the thing.  to [[know]] by rote, is no [[knowledge]], and signifies
no more but only to retain what one has intrusted to our memory.  that
which a [[man]] rightly knows [[know]] and understands, he is the [[free]] disposer of at
his own full [[liberty]], without any regard to the author from whence he had
it, or fumbling over the leaves of his [[book]].  a mere bookish learning is
a [[poor]], paltry learning; it may serve for ornament, but there is yet no
foundation for any superstructure to be built upon it, according to the
opinion of [[plato]], who says, that constancy, [[faith]], and sincerity, are the
true [[philosophy]], and the other sciences [[science]], that are directed to other ends;
mere adulterate paint.  i could [[wish]] that paluel or pompey, those two
noted dancers of my [[time]], could have taught us to cut capers, by only
seeing them do it, without stirring from our places, as these [[men]] pretend
to inform the understanding without ever setting it to [[work]], or that we
could learn to ride, handle a pike, touch a lute, or sing without the
trouble of practice, as these attempt to make us [[judge]] and speak well,
without exercising us in judging or speaking.  now in this initiation of
our studies in their [[progress]], whatsoever presents [[present]] itself before us is
book sufficient; a roguish trick of a page, a sottish mistake of a
servant, a jest at the table, are so many new subjects [[subject]].

and for this [[reason]], conversation with [[men]] is of very [[great]] use and
travel into [[foreign]] countries [[country]]; not to bring back (as most of our young
monsieurs do) an account only of how many paces santa rotonda--[the
pantheon of agrippa.]--is in circuit; or of the richness of signora
livia’s petticoats; or, as some others, how much nero’s face, in a statue
in such an old ruin, is longer and broader than that made for him on some
medal; but to be able chiefly to give an account of the humours [[humour]], manners,
customs, and laws [[law]] of those nations where he has been, and that we may
whet and sharpen our wits by rubbing them against those of others.  i
would that a boy should be sent abroad very [[young]], and first, so as to
kill two birds with one stone, into those neighbouring nations whose
language is most differing from our own, and to which, if it be not
formed betimes, the tongue will grow too stiff to bend.

and also ‘tis the general [[opinion]] of all, that a child should not be
brought up in his mother’s lap.  mothers [[mother]] are too tender, and their
natural affection is apt to make the most discreet of them all so
overfond, that they can neither find in their hearts [[heart]] to give them due
correction for the faults [[fault]] they may commit, nor suffer them to be inured
to hardships and hazards, as they ought to be.  they will not endure to
see them return all dust and sweat from their exercise, to drink cold
drink when they are hot, nor see them mount an unruly horse, nor take a
foil in hand against a rude fencer, or so much as to discharge a carbine.
and yet there is no remedy; whoever will breed a boy to be [[good]] for
anything when he comes to be a [[man]], must by no means spare him when
young, and must very often transgress the rules [[rule]] of physic:

              “vitamque sub dio, et trepidis agat
               in rebus.”

     [“let him [[live]] in open air, and ever in movement about something.”
      --horace, od. ii., 3, 5.]

it is not enough to fortify his [[soul]]; you are also to make his sinews
strong; for the [[soul]] will be [[oppressed]] if not assisted by the members,
and would have too hard a task to discharge two offices alone.  i know
very well to my cost, how much mine groans under the burden, from being
accommodated with a [[body]] so tender and indisposed, as eternally leans and
presses upon her; and often in my reading perceive that our masters, in
their writings, make examples [[example]] pass for magnanimity and fortitude of [[mind]],
which really are rather toughness of skin and hardness of bones; for i
have seen [[men]], [[women]], and [[children]], naturally born of so hard and
insensible a [[constitution]] of [[body]], that a sound cudgelling has been less
to them than a flirt with a finger would have been to me, and that would
neither cry out, wince, nor shrink, for a [[good]] swinging beating; and when
wrestlers counterfeit the [[philosophers]] in patience, ‘tis rather strength
of nerves than stoutness of [[heart]].  now to be inured to undergo [[labour]],
is to be accustomed to endure [[pain]]:

                    “labor callum obducit dolori.”

     [“labour hardens us against [[pain]].”--cicero, tusc. quaes., ii. 15.]

a boy is to be broken in to the toil and roughness of exercise, so as to
be trained up to the [[pain]] and suffering of dislocations, cholics,
cauteries, and even imprisonment and the rack itself; for he may come by
misfortune to be reduced to the worst of these, which (as this world
goes) is sometimes inflicted on the [[good]] as well as the [[bad]].  as for
proof, in our [[present]] civil [[war]] whoever draws his [[sword]] against the laws [[law]],
threatens the honestest [[men]] with the whip and the halter.

and, moreover, by living at [[home]], the [[authority]] of this governor, which
ought to be [[sovereign]] over the boy he has received into his charge, is
often checked and hindered by the presence of parents; to which may also
be added, that the [[respect]] the whole [[family]] [[pay]] him, as their master’s
son, and the [[knowledge]] he has of the estate and greatness he is heir to,
are, in my [[opinion]], no small inconveniences in these tender years.

and yet, even in this conversing with [[men]] i spoke of but now, i have
observed this [[vice]], that instead of gathering observations from others,
we make it our whole [[business]] to lay ourselves open to them, and are more
concerned how to expose and set out our own commodities, than how to
increase our stock by acquiring new.  [[silence]], therefore, and modesty are
very advantageous qualities in conversation.  one should, therefore,
train up this boy to be sparing and an husband of his [[knowledge]] when he
has acquired it; and to forbear taking exceptions at or reproving every
idle saying or ridiculous story that is said or told in his presence; for
it is a very unbecoming rudeness to carp at everything that is not
agreeable to our own palate.  let him be satisfied with correcting
himself, and not seem to condemn everything in another he would not do
himself, nor dispute it as against [[common]] customs.

               “licet sapere sine pompa, sine invidia.”

          [“let us be [[wise]] without ostentation, without envy.”
           --seneca, ep., 103.]

let him avoid these [[vain]] and uncivil images of [[authority]], this childish
ambition of coveting to appear [[better]] bred and more accomplished, than he
really will, by such carriage, discover himself to be.  and, as if
opportunities of interrupting and reprehending were not to be omitted, to
desire thence to derive the [[reputation]] of something more than ordinary.
for as it becomes none but [[great]] poets to make use of the poetical
licence, so it is intolerable for any but [[men]] of [[great]] and illustrious
souls to assume [[privilege]] above the [[authority]] of custom:

     “si quid [[socrates]] ant aristippus contra morem et consuetudinem
     fecerunt, idem sibi ne arbitretur licere: magnis enim illi et
     divinis bonis hanc licentiam assequebantur.”

     [“if [[socrates]] and aristippus have committed any act against manners
     and custom, let him not [[think]] that he is allowed to do the same; for
     it was by [[great]] and [[divine]] benefits that they obtained this
     [[privilege]].”--cicero, de offic., i. 41.]

let him be instructed not to engage in discourse or dispute but with a
champion worthy of him, and, even there, not to make use of all the
little subtleties that may seem pat for his [[purpose]], but only such
arguments as may [[best]] serve him.  let him be taught to be [[curious]] in the
election and [[choice]] of his reasons [[reason]], to abominate impertinence, and
consequently, to affect brevity; but, above all, let him be lessoned to
acquiesce and submit to [[truth]] so soon as ever he shall discover it,
whether in his opponent’s argument, or upon [[better]] consideration of his
own; for he shall never be preferred to the chair for a mere clatter of
words and syllogisms, and is no further engaged to any argument whatever,
than as he shall in his own [[judgment]] approve it: nor yet is arguing a
trade, where the [[liberty]] of recantation and getting off upon better
thoughts, are to be sold for ready [[money]]:

          “neque, ut omnia, qux praescripta et imperata sint,
          defendat, necessitate ulla cogitur.”

     [“neither is their any necessity upon him, that he should defend
     all things that are prescribed and enjoined him.”
      --cicero, acad., ii. 3.]

if his governor be of my [[humour]], he will form his will to be a very good
and [[loyal]] [[subject]] to his [[prince]], very affectionate to his [[person]], and
very stout in his quarrel; but withal he will cool in him the [[desire]] of
having any other tie to his service than [[public]] [[duty]].  besides several
other inconveniences that are inconsistent with the [[liberty]] every honest
man ought to have, a man’s [[judgment]], being bribed and prepossessed by
these particular obligations, is either blinded and less [[free]] to exercise
its function, or is blemished with ingratitude and indiscretion.  a man
that is purely a courtier, can neither have [[power]] nor will to speak or
think otherwise than favourably and well of a master, who, amongst so
many millions of other subjects [[subject]], has picked out him with his own hand to
nourish and advance; this favour, and the [[profit]] flowing from it, must
needs, and not without some show of [[reason]], [[corrupt]] his [[freedom]] and
dazzle him; and we commonly see these [[people]] speak in another [[kind]] of
phrase than is ordinarily spoken by others of the same nation, though
what they say in that courtly [[language]] is not much to be believed.

let his [[conscience]] and [[virtue]] be eminently manifest in his speaking, and
have only [[reason]] for their guide.  make him [[understand]], that to
acknowledge the error he shall discover in his own argument, though only
found out by himself, is an effect of [[judgment]] and sincerity, which are
the principal things he is to seek after; that obstinacy and contention
are [[common]] qualities, most appearing in mean souls [[soul]]; that to revise and
correct himself, to forsake an [[unjust]] argument in the height and heat of
dispute, are rare, [[great]], and philosophical qualities.

let him be advised, being in company, to have his eye and ear in every
corner; for i find that the places of [[greatest]] [[honour]] are commonly seized
upon by [[men]] that have least in them, and that the [[greatest]] fortunes [[fortune]] are
seldom accompanied with the ablest parts.  i have been [[present]] when,
whilst they at the upper end of the chamber have been only commenting the
beauty of the arras, or the flavour of the wine, many things that have
been very finely said at the lower end of the table have been lost and
thrown away.  let him examine every man’s talent; a peasant, a
bricklayer, a passenger: one may learn something from every one of these
in their several capacities, and something will be picked out of their
discourse whereof some use may be made at one [[time]] or another; nay, even
the folly and impertinence of others will contribute to his instruction.
by observing the graces and manners of all he sees, he will create to
himself an emulation of the [[good]], and a contempt of the [[bad]].

let an honest curiosity be suggested to his fancy of being inquisitive
after everything; whatever there is singular and rare near the place
where he is, let him go and see it; a fine house, a [[noble]] fountain, an
eminent [[man]], the place where a [[battle]] has been anciently fought, the
passages of caesar and charlemagne:

              “qux tellus sit lenta gelu, quae putris ab aestu,
               ventus in italiam quis bene vela ferat.”

     [“what [[country]] is bound in frost, what [[land]] is friable with heat,
     what wind serves fairest for [[italy]].”--propertius, iv. 3, 39.]

let him inquire into the manners, revenues [[revenue]], and alliances of princes [[prince]],
things in themselves very pleasant to learn, and very useful to [[know]].

in this conversing with [[men]], i mean also, and principally, those who only
live in the records of [[history]]; he shall, by reading those books [[book]],
converse with the [[great]] and heroic souls [[soul]] of the [[best]] ages [[age]].  ‘tis an idle
and [[vain]] study to those who make it so by doing it after a negligent
manner, but to those who do it with [[care]] and observation, ‘tis a study of
inestimable fruit and value; and the only study, as [[plato]] reports, that
the lacedaemonians reserved to themselves.  what [[profit]] shall he not reap
as to the [[business]] of [[men]], by reading the lives [[life]] of plutarch?  but,
withal, let my governor [[remember]] to what end his instructions are
principally directed, and that he do not so much imprint in his pupil’s
memory the date of the ruin of [[carthage]], as the manners of hannibal and
scipio; nor so much where marcellus died, as why it was unworthy of his
duty that he died there.  let him not [[teach]] him so much the narrative
parts of [[history]] as to [[judge]] them; the reading of them, in my [[opinion]],
is a thing that of all others we apply ourselves unto with the most
differing measure.  i have [[read]] a hundred things in livy that another has
not, or not taken notice of at least; and plutarch has [[read]] a hundred
more there than ever i could find, or than, peradventure, that author
ever wrote; to some it is merely a grammar study, to others the very
anatomy of [[philosophy]], by which the most abstruse parts of our human
nature penetrate.  there are in plutarch many long discourses very worthy
to be carefully [[read]] and observed, for he is, in my [[opinion]], of all
others the [[greatest]] master in that [[kind]] of writing; but there are a
thousand others which he has only touched and glanced upon, where he only
points with his finger to direct us which way we may go if we will, and
contents himself sometimes with giving only one brisk hit in the nicest
article of the [[question]], whence we are to grope out the rest.  as, for
example, where he says’--[in the essay on false shame.]--that the
inhabitants of [[asia]] came to be vassals to one only, for not having been
able to pronounce one syllable, which is no.  which saying of his gave
perhaps matter and [[occasion]] to la boetie to write his “voluntary
servitude.”  only to see him pick out a [[light]] action in a man’s [[life]], or
a mere word that does not seem to amount even to that, is itself a whole
discourse.  ‘tis to our prejudice that [[men]] of understanding should so
immoderately affect brevity; no [[doubt]] their [[reputation]] is the [[better]] by
it, but in the meantime we are the worse.  plutarch had rather we should
applaud his [[judgment]] than commend his [[knowledge]], and had rather leave us
with an appetite to [[read]] more, than glutted with that we have already
read.  he knew very well, that a [[man]] may say too much even upon the best
subjects, and that alexandridas justly reproached him who made very [[good]].
but too long speeches [[speech]] to the ephori, when he said: “o stranger!  thou
speakest the things thou shouldst speak, but not as thou shouldst speak
them.”--[plutarch, apothegms of the lacedamonians.]--such as have lean
and spare bodies [[body]] stuff themselves out with clothes; so they who are
defective in matter endeavour to make amends with words.

human understanding is marvellously enlightened by daily conversation
with [[men]], for we are, otherwise, compressed and heaped up in ourselves,
and have our sight limited to the length of our own noses.  one asking
socrates of what [[country]] he was, he did not make [[answer]], of [[athens]], but
of the [[world]];--[cicero, tusc. quaes., v. 37; plutarch, on [[exile]], c. 4.]--
he whose [[imagination]] was fuller and wider, embraced the whole [[world]] for
his [[country]], and extended his [[society]] and [[friendship]] to all [[mankind]];
not as we do, who look no further than our feet.  when the vines of my
village are nipped with the frost, my parish [[priest]] presently concludes,
that the indignation of [[god]] has gone out against all the [[human]] [[race]], and
that the cannibals have already got the pip.  who is it that, seeing the
havoc of these civil wars [[war]] of ours, does not cry out, that the machine of
the [[world]] is near dissolution, and that the day of [[judgment]] is at hand;
without considering, that many worse things have been seen, and that in
the meantime, [[people]] are very merry in a thousand other parts of the
earth for all this?  for my part, considering the licence and impunity
that always attend such commotions, i wonder they are so moderate, and
that there is no more mischief done.  to him who feels [[feel]] the hailstones
patter about his ears, the whole hemisphere appears to be in storm and
tempest; like the ridiculous savoyard, who said very gravely, that if
that simple [[king]] of [[france]] could have managed his [[fortune]] as he should
have done, he might in [[time]] have come to have been steward of the
household to the duke his master: the fellow could not, in his shallow
imagination, conceive that there could be anything greater than a duke of
savoy.  and, in [[truth]], we are all of us, insensibly, in this error, an
error of a very [[great]] weight and very pernicious consequence.  but
whoever shall represent to his fancy, as in a picture, that [[great]] image
of our [[mother]] [[nature]], in her full majesty and lustre, whoever in her face
shall [[read]] so general and so constant a variety, whoever shall observe
himself in that figure, and not himself but a whole [[kingdom]], no bigger
than the least touch or prick of a pencil in comparison of the whole,
that [[man]] alone is able to value things according to their true estimate
and grandeur.

this [[great]] [[world]] which some do yet multiply as several [[species]] under one
genus, is the mirror wherein we are to behold ourselves, to be able to
know ourselves as we ought to do in the true bias.  in short, i would
have this to be the [[book]] my [[young]] gentleman should study with the most
attention.  so many humours [[humour]], so many sects, so many judgments [[judgment]], opinions [[opinion]],
laws, and customs, [[teach]] us to [[judge]] aright of our own, and inform our
understanding to discover its imperfection and [[natural]] infirmity, which
is no trivial speculation.  so many mutations of states and kingdoms [[kingdom]], and
so many turns and revolutions [[revolution]] of [[public]] [[fortune]], will make us [[wise]] enough
to make no [[great]] wonder of our own.  so many [[great]] names, so many famous
victories and conquests drowned and swallowed in oblivion, render our
hopes ridiculous of eternising our names by the taking of half-a-score of
light horse, or a henroost, which only derives its memory from its ruin.
the [[pride]] and arrogance of so many [[foreign]] pomps, the inflated majesty of
so many courts and grandeurs, accustom and fortify our sight without
closing our [[eyes]] to behold the lustre of our own; so many trillions of
men, buried before us, encourage us not to [[fear]] to go seek such good
company in the other [[world]]: and so of the rest pythagoras was want to
say,--[cicero, tusc. quaes., v.  3.]--that our [[life]] resembles the great
and populous assembly of the olympic games, wherein some exercise the
body, that they may carry away the [[glory]] of the prize: others bring
merchandise to sell for [[profit]]: there are also some (and those none of
the worst sort) who pursue no other advantage than only to look on, and
consider how and why everything is done, and to be spectators of the
lives of other [[men]], thereby the [[better]] to [[judge]] of and regulate their
own.

to examples [[example]] may fitly be applied all the profitable discourses of
philosophy, to which all [[human]] actions, as to their [[best]] [[rule]], ought to
be especially directed: a scholar shall be taught to know--

                    “quid fas optare: quid asper
          utile nummus habet: patrix carisque propinquis
          quantum elargiri deceat: quern te deus esse
          jussit, et humana qua parte locatus es in re;
          quid sumus, et quidnam victuri gignimur.”

     [“learn what it is [[right]] to [[wish]]; what is the true use of coined
     [[money]]; how much it becomes us to give in liberality to our country
     and our dear relations; whom and what the deity commanded thee to
     be; and in what part of the [[human]] [[system]] thou art [[arts]] placed; what we
     are ant to what [[purpose]] engendered.”--persius, iii. 69]

what it is to [[know]], and what to be ignorant; what ought to be the end and
design of study; what valour, temperance, and [[justice]] are; the difference
betwixt [[ambition]] and avarice, servitude and subjection, licence and
liberty; by what token a [[man]] may [[know]] true and solid contentment; how far
death, affliction, and disgrace are to be apprehended;

          “et quo quemque modo fugiatque feratque laborem.”

          [“and how you may shun or sustain every hardship.”
           --virgil, aeneid, iii. 459.]

by what secret springs we move, and the [[reason]] of our various agitations
and irresolutions: for, methinks the first doctrine with which one should
season his understanding, ought to be that which regulates his manners
and his sense; that teaches [[teach]] him to [[know]] himself, and how both well to dig
and well to [[live]].  amongst the liberal sciences [[science]], let us begin with that
which makes us [[free]]; not that they do not all serve in some measure to
the instruction and use of [[life]], as all other things in some sort also
do; but let us make [[choice]] of that which directly and professedly serves
to that end.  if we are once able to restrain the offices of [[human]] life
within their just and [[natural]] limits, we shall find that most of the
sciences in use are of no [[great]] use to us, and even in those that are,
that there are many very unnecessary cavities and dilatations which we
had [[better]] let alone, and, following socrates’ direction, limit the
course of our studies to those things only where is a true and real
utility:

                              “sapere aude;
               incipe;  qui recte vivendi prorogat horam,
               rusticus exspectat, dum defluat amnis; at ille
               labitur, et labetur in omne volubilis oevum.”

     [“dare to be [[wise]]; begin! he who defers the hour of living well is
     like the clown, waiting till the river shall have flowed out: but
     the river still flows, and will run on, with constant course, to
     ages [[age]] without end.”--horace, ep., i. 2.]

‘tis a [[great]] foolery to [[teach]] our [[children]]:

              “quid moveant pisces, animosaque signa leonis,
               lotus et hesperia quid capricornus aqua,”

     [“what influence pisces have, or the sign of angry leo, or
     capricorn, washed by the hesperian wave.”--propertius, iv. i, 89.]

the [[knowledge]] of the stars and the motion of the eighth sphere before
their own:

     [“what [[care]] i about the pleiades or the stars of taurus?”
      --anacreon, ode, xvii. 10.]

anaximenes writing to pythagoras, “to what [[purpose]],” said he, “should i
trouble myself in searching out the secrets of the stars, having [[death]] or
slavery continually before my [[eyes]]?” for the kings [[king]] of [[persia]] were at that
time preparing to invade his [[country]].  every one ought to say thus,
“being assaulted, as i am by [[ambition]], avarice, temerity, superstition,
and having within so many other enemies [[enemy]] of [[life]], shall i go ponder over
the world’s changes [[change]]?”

after having taught him what will make him more [[wise]] and [[good]], you may
then entertain him with the elements of [[logic]], physics, geometry,
rhetoric, and the [[science]] which he shall then himself most incline to,
his [[judgment]] being beforehand formed and fit to choose, he will quickly
make his own.  the way of instructing him ought to be sometimes by
discourse, and sometimes by reading; sometimes his governor shall put the
author himself, which he shall [[think]] most proper for him, into his hands,
and sometimes only the marrow and substance of it; and if himself be not
conversant enough in books [[book]] to turn to all the fine discourses the books
contain for his [[purpose]], there may some [[man]] of learning be joined to him,
that upon every [[occasion]] shall supply him with what he stands in need of,
to furnish it to his pupil.  and who can [[doubt]] but that this way of
teaching is much more easy and [[natural]] than that of gaza,--[theodore
gaza, rector of the academy of ferrara.]--in which the precepts are so
intricate, and so harsh, and the words so [[vain]], lean; and insignificant,
that there is no hold to be taken of them, nothing that quickens and
elevates the wit and fancy, whereas here the [[mind]] has what to feed upon
and to digest.  this fruit, therefore, is not only without comparison,
much more [[fair]] and beautiful; but will also be much more early ripe.

‘tis a thousand pities that matters should be at such a pass in this age
of ours, that [[philosophy]], even with [[men]] of understanding, should be,
looked upon as a [[vain]] and fantastic name, a thing of no use, no value,
either in [[opinion]] or effect, of which i [[think]] those ergotisms and petty
sophistries, by prepossessing the avenues to it, are the cause.  and
people are much to blame to represent it to [[children]] for a thing of so
difficult access, and with such a frowning, grim, and formidable aspect.
who is it that has disguised it thus, with this false, pale, and ghostly
countenance?  there is nothing more airy, more [[gay]], more frolic, and i
had like to have said, more wanton.  she preaches nothing but feasting
and jollity; a melancholic anxious look shows that she does not inhabit
there.  demetrius the grammarian finding in the temple of delphos a knot
of [[philosophers]] set chatting together, said to them,--[plutarch, treatise
on oracles which have ceased]--“either i am much deceived, or by your
cheerful and pleasant countenances, you are engaged in no, very deep
discourse.”  to which one of them, heracleon the megarean, replied:
“tis for such as are puzzled about inquiring whether the future tense of
the verb ------ is spelt with a double a, or that hunt after the
derivation of the comparatives ----- and -----, and the superlatives ----
and ------, to knit their brows whilst discoursing of their [[science]]: but
as to philosophical discourses, they always divert and cheer up those
that entertain them, and never deject them or make them [[sad]].”

              “deprendas animi tormenta latentis in aegro
               corpore; deprendas et gaudia; sumit utrumque
               inde habitum facies.”

     [“you may discern the torments of [[mind]] lurking in a sick [[body]]; you
     may discern its joys: either expression the face assumes from the
     [[mind]].”--juvenal, ix. 18]

the [[soul]] that lodges [[philosophy]], ought to be of such a [[constitution]] of
health, as to render the [[body]] in like manner healthful too; she ought to
make her tranquillity and satisfaction shine so as to appear without, and
her contentment ought to [[fashion]] the outward behaviour to her own mould,
and consequently to fortify it with a graceful confidence, an active and
joyous carriage, and a serene and contented countenance.  the most
manifest sign of [[wisdom]] is a continual cheerfulness; her [[state]] is like
that of things in the regions above the moon, always clear and serene.
‘tis baroco and baralipton--[two terms of the ancient scholastic
logic.]--that render their disciples so dirty and ill-favoured, and not
she; they do not so much as [[know]] her but by hearsay.  what!  it is she
that calms and appeases the storms and tempests of the [[soul]], and who
teaches famine and fevers to laugh and sing; and that, not by certain
imaginary epicycles, but by [[natural]] and manifest reasons [[reason]].  she has virtue
for her end, which is not, as the schoolmen say, situate upon the summit
of a perpendicular, rugged, inaccessible precipice: such as have
approached her find her, quite on the contrary, to be seated in a [[fair]],
fruitful, and flourishing plain, whence she easily discovers all things
below; to which place any one may, however, arrive, if he [[know]] but the
way, through shady, green, and sweetly-flourishing avenues, by a
pleasant, easy, and smooth descent, like that of the celestial vault.
‘tis for not having frequented this supreme, this beautiful, triumphant,
and amiable, this equally delicious and courageous [[virtue]], this so
professed and implacable [[enemy]] to [[anxiety]], [[sorrow]], [[fear]], and constraint,
who, having [[nature]] for her guide, has [[fortune]] and [[pleasure]] for her
companions, that they have gone, according to their own [[weak]] [[imagination]],
and created this ridiculous, this sorrowful, querulous, despiteful,
threatening, terrible image of it to themselves and others, and placed it
upon a rock apart, amongst thorns and brambles, and made of it a
hobgoblin to affright [[people]].

but the governor that i would have, that is such a one as knows [[know]] it to be
his [[duty]] to possess his pupil with as much or more affection than
reverence to [[virtue]], will be able to inform him, that the poets have
evermore accommodated themselves to the [[public]] [[humour]], and make him
sensible, that the gods have planted more toil and sweat in the avenues
of the cabinets of [[venus]] than in those of minerva.  and when he shall
once find him begin to apprehend, and shall represent to him a bradamante
or an angelica--[heroines of ariosto.]--for a mistress, a [[natural]],
active, generous, and not a viragoish, but a manly [[beauty]], in comparison
of a soft, delicate, artificial simpering, and affected form; the one in
the habit of a heroic [[youth]], wearing a glittering helmet, the other
tricked up in curls and ribbons like a wanton minx; he will then look
upon his own affection as brave and masculine, when he shall choose quite
contrary to that effeminate shepherd of phrygia.

such a tutor will make a pupil digest this new lesson, that the height
and value of true [[virtue]] consists in the facility, utility, and pleasure
of its exercise; so far from difficulty, that boys, as well as [[men]], and
the [[innocent]] as well as the subtle, may make it their own; it is by
order, and not by [[force]], that it is to be acquired.  [[socrates]], her first
minion, is so averse to all manner of [[violence]], as totally to throw it
aside, to slip into the more [[natural]] facility of her own [[progress]]; ‘tis
the nursing [[mother]] of all [[human]] pleasures [[pleasure]], who in rendering them just,
renders them also pure and permanent; in moderating them, keeps them in
breath and appetite; in interdicting those which she herself refuses,
whets our [[desire]] to those that she allows; and, like a [[kind]] and liberal
mother, abundantly allows all that [[nature]] requires, even to satiety, if
not to lassitude: unless we mean to say that the regimen which stops the
toper before he has drunk himself drunk, the glutton before he has eaten
to a surfeit, and the lecher before he has got the pox, is an [[enemy]] to
pleasure.  if the ordinary [[fortune]] fail, she does without it, and forms
another, wholly her own, not so fickle and unsteady as the other.  she
can be [[rich]], be potent and [[wise]], and knows [[know]] how to [[lie]] upon soft perfumed
beds: she loves [[love]] [[life]], [[beauty]], [[glory]], and health; but her proper and
peculiar office is to [[know]] how to regulate the use of all these good
things, and how to lose them without concern: an office much more noble
than troublesome, and without which the whole course of [[life]] is
unnatural, turbulent, and deformed, and there it is indeed, that [[men]] may
justly represent those monsters upon rocks and precipices.

if this pupil shall happen to be of so contrary a disposition, that he
had rather hear a tale of a tub than the true narrative of some noble
expedition or some [[wise]] and learned discourse; who at the beat of drum,
that excites the youthful ardour of his companions, leaves that to follow
another that calls to a morris or the bears; who would not [[wish]], and find
it more delightful and more excellent, to return all dust and sweat
victorious from a [[battle]], than from tennis or from a ball, with the prize
of those exercises; i see no other remedy, but that he be bound prentice
in some [[good]] town to learn to make minced pies, though he were the [[son]] of
a duke; according to plato’s precept, that [[children]] are to be placed out
and disposed of, not according to the [[wealth]], qualities, or condition of
the [[father]], but according to the faculties and the capacity of their own
souls.

since [[philosophy]] is that which instructs us to [[live]], and that infancy has
there its lessons as well as other ages [[age]], why is it not communicated to
children betimes?

         “udum et molle lutum est; nunc, nunc properandus, et acri
          fingendus sine fine rota.”

     [“the clay is moist and soft: now, now make haste, and form the
     pitcher on the rapid wheel.”--persius, iii. 23.]

they begin to [[teach]] us to [[live]] when we have almost done living.
a hundred students have got the pox before they have come to read
aristotle’s lecture on temperance.  cicero said, that though he should
live two [[men’s]] ages [[age]], he should never find leisure to study the lyric
poets; and i find these sophisters yet more deplorably unprofitable.
the boy we would breed has a [[great]] deal less [[time]] to spare; he owes but
the first fifteen or sixteen years of his [[life]] to [[education]]; the
remainder is due to action.  let us, therefore, employ that short [[time]] in
necessary instruction.  away with the thorny subtleties of dialectics;
they are abuses [[abuse]], things by which our lives [[life]] can never be amended: take the
plain philosophical discourses, learn how rightly to choose, and then
rightly to apply them; they are more easy to be understood than one of
boccaccio’s novels; a child from nurse is much more capable of them, than
of learning to [[read]] or to write.  [[philosophy]] has discourses proper for
childhood, as well as for the decrepit [[age]] of [[men]].

i am of plutarch’s [[mind]], that [[aristotle]] did not so much trouble his great
disciple with the knack of forming syllogisms, or with the elements of
geometry; as with infusing into him [[good]] precepts concerning valour,
prowess, magnanimity, temperance, and the contempt of [[fear]]; and with this
ammunition, sent him, whilst yet a boy, with no more than thirty thousand
foot, four thousand horse, and but forty-two thousand crowns [[crown]], to
subjugate the [[empire]] of the whole [[earth]].  for the other acts and
sciences, he says, alexander highly indeed commended their excellence and
charm, and had them in very [[great]] [[honour]] and esteem, but not ravished
with them to that [[degree]] as to be tempted to affect the practice of them
in his own [[person]]:

              “petite hinc, juvenesque senesque,
              finem ammo certum, miserisque viatica canis.”

     [“young [[men]] and old [[men]], derive hence a [[certain]] end to the [[mind]],
     and stores for miserable grey hairs.”--persius, v. 64.]

epicurus, in the beginning of his letter to meniceus,--[diogenes
laertius, x. 122.]--says, “that neither the youngest should refuse to
philosophise, nor the oldest grow weary of it.”  who does otherwise,
seems tacitly to imply, that either the [[time]] of living happily is
not yet come, or that it is already [[past]].  and yet, a for all that, i
would not have this pupil of ours imprisoned and made a [[slave]] to his
book; nor would i have him given up to the morosity and melancholic
humour of a sour ill-natured pedant.

i would not have his spirit cowed and subdued, by applying him to the
rack, and tormenting him, as some do, fourteen or fifteen hours a day,
and so make a pack-horse of him.  neither should i [[think]] it [[good]], when,
by [[reason]] of a solitary and melancholic [[complexion]], he is discovered to
be overmuch addicted to his [[book]], to nourish that [[humour]] in him; for that
renders him unfit for civil conversation, and diverts him from better
employments.  and how many have i seen in my [[time]] totally brutified by an
immoderate thirst after [[knowledge]]?  carneades was so besotted with it,
that he would not find [[time]] so much as to comb his head or to pare his
nails.  neither would i have his generous manners spoiled and corrupted
by the incivility and barbarism of those of another.  the french wisdom
was anciently turned into proverb: “early, but of no continuance.”  and,
in [[truth]], we yet see, that nothing can be more ingenious and pleasing
than the [[children]] of [[france]]; but they ordinarily [[deceive]] the [[hope]] and
expectation that have been conceived of them; and grown up to be [[men]],
have nothing extraordinary or worth taking notice of: i have heard [[men]] of
good understanding say, these colleges of ours to which we send our young
people (and of which we have but too many) make them such animals as they
are.--[hobbes said that if he had been at college as long as other people
he should have been as [[great]] a blockhead as they. w.c.h.] [and bacon
before hobbe’s [[time]] had discussed the “futility” of [[university]] teaching.
d.w.]

but to our little monsieur, a closet, a garden, the table, his bed,
solitude, and company, morning and evening, all hours shall be the same,
and all places to him a study; for [[philosophy]], who, as the formatrix of
judgment and manners, shall be his principal lesson, has that privilege
to have a hand in everything.  the orator isocrates, being at a feast
entreated to speak of his art [[arts]], all the company were satisfied with and
commended his [[answer]]:  “it is not now a [[time]],” said he, “to do what i can
do; and that which it is now [[time]] to do, i cannot do.”--[plutarch,
symp., i. i.]--for to make orations and rhetorical disputes in a company
met together to laugh and make [[good]] cheer, had been very unreasonable and
improper, and as much might have been said of all the other sciences [[science]].
but as to what concerns [[philosophy]], that part of it at least that treats
of [[man]], and of his offices and duties [[duty]], it has been the [[common]] [[opinion]] of
all [[wise]] [[men]], that, out of [[respect]] to the sweetness of her conversation,
she is ever to be admitted in all sports [[sport]] and entertainments.  and [[plato]],
having invited her to his feast, we see after how gentle and obliging a
manner, accommodated both to [[time]] and place, she entertained the company,
though in a discourse of the highest and most important [[nature]]:

              “aeque pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aeque;
               et, neglecta, aeque pueris senibusque nocebit.”

     [“it profits [[profit]] [[poor]] and [[rich]] alike, but, neglected, equally hurts old
     and [[young]].”--horace, ep., i. 25.]

by this method of instruction, my [[young]] pupil will be much more and
better employed than his fellows of the college are.  but as the steps we
take in walking to and fro in a gallery, though three times [[time]] as many, do
not tire a [[man]] so much as those we employ in a formal [[journey]], so our
lesson, as it were accidentally occurring, without any set obligation of
time or place, and falling naturally into every action, will insensibly
insinuate itself.  by which means our very exercises and recreations,
running, wrestling, [[music]], dancing, hunting, riding, and fencing, will
prove to be a [[good]] part of our study.  i would have his outward fashion
and mien, and the disposition of his limbs, formed at the same [[time]] with
his [[mind]].  ‘tis not a [[soul]], ‘tis not a [[body]] that we are training up, but
a [[man]], and we ought not to divide him.  and, as [[plato]] says, we are not to
fashion one without the other, but make them draw together like two
horses harnessed to a coach.  by which saying of his, does he not seem to
allow more [[time]] for, and to take more [[care]] of exercises for the [[body]], and
to hold that the [[mind]], in a [[good]] proportion, does her [[business]] at the
same [[time]] too?

as to the rest, this method of [[education]] ought to be carried on with a
severe sweetness, quite contrary to the practice of our pedants, who,
instead of tempting and alluring [[children]] to letters by apt and gentle
ways, do in [[truth]] [[present]] nothing before them but rods and ferules,
horror and [[cruelty]].  away with this violence!  away with this compulsion!
than which, i certainly [[believe]] nothing more dulls and degenerates a
well-descended [[nature]].  if you would have him apprehend shame and
chastisement, do not harden him to them: inure him to heat and cold, to
wind and sun, and to dangers that he ought to despise; wean him from all
effeminacy and delicacy in clothes and lodging, eating and drinking;
accustom him to everything, that he may not be a sir [[paris]],
a carpet-knight, but a sinewy, hardy, and vigorous [[young]] [[man]].  i have
ever from a child to the [[age]] wherein i now am, been of this [[opinion]], and
am still constant to it.  but amongst other things, the strict
government of most of our colleges has evermore displeased me;
peradventure, they might have erred less perniciously on the indulgent
side.  ‘tis a real house of correction of imprisoned [[youth]].  they are
made debauched by being punished before they are so.  do but come in
when they are about their lesson, and you shall hear nothing but the
outcries of boys under execution, with the thundering noise of their
pedagogues drunk with fury. a very pretty way this, to tempt these
tender and timorous souls [[soul]] to [[love]] their [[book]], with a furious
countenance, and a rod in hand!  a cursed and pernicious way of
proceeding!  besides what quintilian has very well observed, that this
imperious [[authority]] is often attended by very dangerous consequences,
and particularly our way of chastising.  how much more decent would it
be to see their classes strewed with green leaves and fine flowers, than
with the bloody stumps of birch and willows?  were it left to my
ordering.  i should paint the school with the pictures of joy and
gladness; flora and the graces, as the philosopher speusippus did his.
where their [[profit]] is, let them there have their [[pleasure]] too. such
viands as are proper and wholesome for [[children]], should be sweetened
with sugar, and such as are dangerous to them, embittered with gall.
‘tis marvellous to see how solicitous [[plato]] is in his laws [[law]] concerning
the gaiety and diversion of the [[youth]] of his [[city]], and how much and
often he enlarges upon the races [[race]], sports [[sport]], songs [[song]], leaps, and dances: of
which, he says, that antiquity has given the ordering and patronage
particularly to the gods themselves, to [[apollo]], minerva, and the muses.
he insists long upon, and is very particular in, giving innumerable
precepts for exercises; but as to the lettered sciences [[science]], says very
little, and only seems particularly to recommend poetry upon the account
of [[music]].

all singularity in our manners and conditions is to be avoided, as
inconsistent with civil [[society]].  who would not be astonished at so
strange a [[constitution]] as that of demophoon, steward to alexander the
great, who sweated in the shade and shivered in the sun?  i have seen
those who have run from the smell of a mellow apple with greater
precipitation than from a harquebuss-shot; others afraid of a mouse;
others vomit at the sight of cream; others ready to swoon at the making
of a feather bed; germanicus could neither endure the sight nor the
crowing of a cock.  i will not deny, but that there may, peradventure,
be some occult cause and [[natural]] aversion in these cases; but, in my
opinion, a [[man]] might conquer it, if he took it in [[time]].  precept has in
this wrought so effectually upon me, though not without some pains [[pain]] on my
part, i confess, that beer excepted, my appetite accommodates itself
indifferently to all sorts of diet.  [[young]] bodies [[body]] are supple; one should,
therefore, in that [[age]] bend and ply them to all fashions and customs: and
provided a [[man]] can contain the appetite and the will within their due
limits, let a [[young]] [[man]], in [[god’s]] name, be rendered fit for all nations
and all companies, even to debauchery and excess, if need be; that is,
where he shall do it out of complacency to the customs of the place.
let him be able to do everything, but [[love]] to do nothing but what is
good.  the [[philosophers]] themselves do not justify callisthenes for
forfeiting the favour of his master alexander the [[great]], by refusing to
pledge him a cup of wine.  let him laugh, play, wench with his [[prince]]:
nay, i would have him, even in his debauches, too hard for the rest of
the company, and to excel his companions in ability and vigour, and that
he may not give over doing it, either through defect of [[power]] or
knowledge how to do it, but for want of will.

     “multum interest, utrum peccare ali quis nolit, an nesciat.”

     [“there is a vast difference betwixt forbearing to [[sin]], and not
     knowing how to [[sin]].”--seneca, ep., 90]

i [[thought]] i passed a compliment upon a [[lord]], as [[free]] from those excesses
as any [[man]] in [[france]], by asking him before a [[great]] deal of very good
company, how many times [[time]] in his [[life]] he had been drunk in germany, in the
time of his being there about his majesty’s affairs; which he also took
as it was intended, and made [[answer]], “three times”; and withal told us
the whole story of his debauches.  i [[know]] some who, for want of this
faculty, have found a [[great]] inconvenience in negotiating with that
nation.  i have often with [[great]] admiration reflected upon the wonderful
constitution of alcibiades, who so easily could transform himself to so
various fashions without any prejudice to his health; one while outdoing
the persian pomp and luxury, and another, the lacedaemonian austerity and
frugality; as reformed in sparta, as voluptuous in ionia:

          “omnis aristippum decuit color, et status, et res.”

     [“every [[complexion]] of [[life]], and station, and circumstance became
     aristippus.”--horace, ep., xvii. 23.]

i would have my pupil to be such an one,

                    “quem duplici panno patentia velat,
               mirabor, vitae via si conversa decebit,
               personamque feret non inconcinnus utramque.”

     [“i should [[admire]] him who with patience bearing a patched garment,
     bears well a changed [[fortune]], acting both parts equally well.”
      --horace ep., xvii. 25.]

these are my lessons, and he who puts them in practice shall reap more
advantage than he who has had them [[read]] to him only, and so only knows
them.  if you see him, you hear him; if you hear him, you see him.  god
forbid, says one in [[plato]], that to philosophise were only to [[read]] a great
many books [[book]], and to learn the [[arts]].

          “hanc amplissimam omnium artium bene vivendi disciplinam,
          vita magis quam literis, persequuti sunt.”

     [“they have proceeded to this discipline of living well, which of
     all [[arts]] is the [[greatest]], by their lives [[life]], rather than by their
     reading.”--cicero, tusc. quaes., iv. 3.]

leo, [[prince]] of the phliasians, asking heraclides ponticus--[it was not
heraclides of pontus who made this [[answer]], but pythagoras.]--of what art
or [[science]] he made profession: “i [[know]],” said he, “neither art [[arts]] nor
science, but i am a philosopher.”  one reproaching diogenes that, being
ignorant, he should pretend to [[philosophy]]; “i therefore,” answered he,
“pretend to it with so much the more [[reason]].”  hegesias entreated that he
would [[read]] a [[certain]] [[book]] to him: “you are pleasant,” said he; “you
choose those figs that are true and [[natural]], and not those that are
painted; why do you not also choose exercises which are naturally true,
rather than those written?”

the lad will not so much get his lesson by [[heart]] as he will practise it:
he will repeat it in his actions.  we shall discover if there be prudence
in his exercises, if there be sincerity and [[justice]] in his deportment, if
there be grace and [[judgment]] in his speaking; if there be constancy in his
sickness; if there be modesty in his mirth, temperance in his pleasures [[pleasure]],
order in his domestic economy, indifference in palate, whether what he
eats or drinks be flesh or fish, wine or water:

     “qui disciplinam suam non ostentationem scientiae, sed legem vitae
     putet: quique obtemperet ipse sibi, et decretis pareat.”

     [“who considers his own discipline, not as a [[vain]] ostentation of
     [[science]], but as a [[law]] and [[rule]] of [[life]]; and who obeys his own
     decrees, and the laws [[law]] he has prescribed for himself.”
      --cicero, tusc.  quaes., ii. 4.]

the conduct of our lives [[life]] is the true mirror of our doctrine.  zeuxidamus,
to one who [[asked]] him, why the lacedaemonians did not commit their
constitutions of chivalry to writing, and deliver them to their [[young]] men
to [[read]], made [[answer]], that it was because they would inure them to
action, and not amuse them with words.  with such a one, after fifteen or
sixteen years’ study, compare one of our college latinists, who has
thrown away so much [[time]] in nothing but learning to speak.  the [[world]] is
nothing but babble; and i hardly ever yet saw that [[man]] who did not rather
prate too much, than speak too little.  and yet half of our [[age]] is
embezzled this way: we are kept four or five years to learn words only,
and to tack them together into clauses; as many more to form them into a
long discourse, divided into four or five parts; and other five years, at
least, to learn succinctly to mix and interweave them after a subtle and
intricate manner let us leave all this to those who make a profession of
it.

going one day to orleans, i met in that plain on this side clery, two
pedants who were travelling towards bordeaux, about fifty paces distant
from one another; and, a [[good]] way further behind them, i discovered a
troop of horse, with a gentleman at the head of them, who was the late
monsieur le comte de la rochefoucauld.  one of my [[people]] inquired of the
foremost of these masters of [[arts]], who that gentleman was that came after
him; he, having not seen the train that followed after, and thinking his
companion was meant, pleasantly answered, “he is not a gentleman; he is a
grammarian; and i am a logician.”  now we who, quite contrary, do not
here pretend to breed a grammarian or a logician, but a gentleman, let us
leave them to [[abuse]] their leisure; our [[business]] lies [[lie]] elsewhere.  let but
our pupil be well furnished with things, words will [[follow]] but too fast;
he will pull them after him if they do not voluntarily [[follow]].  i have
observed some to make excuses, that they cannot express themselves, and
pretend to have their fancies full of a [[great]] many very fine things,
which yet, for want of eloquence, they cannot utter; ‘tis a mere shift,
and nothing else.  will you [[know]] what i [[think]] of it?  i [[think]] they are
nothing but shadows of some imperfect images and conceptions that they
know not what to make of within, nor consequently bring out; they do not
yet themselves [[understand]] what they would be at, and if you but observe
how they haggle and stammer upon the point of parturition, you will soon
conclude, that their [[labour]] is not to delivery, but about conception, and
that they are but licking their formless embryo.  for my part, i hold,
and [[socrates]] commands it, that whoever has in his [[mind]] a sprightly and
clear [[imagination]], he will express it well enough in one [[kind]] of tongue
or another, and, if he be dumb, by signs--

               “verbaque praevisam rem non invita sequentur;”

     [“once a thing is conceived in the [[mind]], the words to express it
     soon [[present]] themselves.” (“the words will not reluctantly [[follow]] the
     thing preconceived.”)--horace, de arte poetica. v. 311]

and as another as poetically says in his prose:

          “quum res animum occupavere, verbs ambiunt,”

     [“when things are once in the [[mind]], the words offer themselves
     readily.”  (“when things have taken possession of the [[mind]], the
     words trip.”)--seneca, controvers., iii.  proem.]

and this other.

                    “ipsae res verbs rapiunt.”

     [“the things themselves [[force]] the words to express them.”
      --cicero, de finib., iii.  5.]

he knows [[know]] nothing of ablative, conjunctive, substantive, or grammar, no
more than his lackey, or a fishwife of the petit pont; and yet these will
give you a bellyful of talk, if you will hear them, and peradventure
shall trip as little in their [[language]] as the [[best]] masters of art [[arts]] in
france.  he knows [[know]] no rhetoric, nor how in a preface to bribe the
benevolence of the courteous reader; neither does he [[care]] to [[know]] it.
indeed all this fine decoration of painting is easily effaced by the
lustre of a simple and blunt [[truth]]; these fine flourishes serve only to
amuse the vulgar, of themselves incapable of more solid and nutritive
diet, as aper very evidently demonstrates in tacitus.  the ambassadors
of samos, prepared with a long and elegant oration, came to cleomenes,
king of sparta, to incite him to a [[war]] against the [[tyrant]] polycrates;
who, after he had heard their harangue with [[great]] gravity and patience,
gave them this [[answer]]: “as to the exordium, i [[remember]] it not, nor
consequently the middle of your [[speech]]; and for what concerns your
conclusion, i will not do what you [[desire]]:”--[plutarch, apothegms of the
lacedaemonians.]--a very pretty [[answer]] this, methinks, and a pack of
learned orators most sweetly gravelled.  and what did the other [[man]] say?
the athenians were to choose one of two architects for a very great
building they had designed; of these, the first, a pert affected fellow,
offered his service in a long premeditated discourse upon the [[subject]] of
the [[work]] in hand, and by his oratory inclined the voices of the [[people]] in
his favour; but the other in three words: “o athenians, what this man
says, i will do.”--[plutarch, instructions to statesmen, c. 4.]--
when cicero was in the height and heat of an eloquent harangue, many were
struck with admiration; but cato only laughed, saying, “we have a
pleasant (mirth-making) consul.”  let it go before, or come after, a good
sentence or a thing well said, is always in season; if it neither suit
well with what went before, nor has much coherence with what follows
after, it is [[good]] in itself.  i am none of those who [[think]] that good
rhyme makes a [[good]] poem.  let him make short long, and long short if he
will, ‘tis no [[great]] matter; if there be invention, and that the wit and
judgment have well performed their offices, i will say, here’s a good
poet, but an ill rhymer.

               “emunctae naris, durus componere versus.”

          [“of delicate [[humour]], but of rugged versification.”
           --horace, sat, iv. 8.]

let a [[man]], says horace, divest his [[work]] of all method and measure,

         “tempora certa modosque, et, quod prius ordine verbum est,
          posterius facias, praeponens ultima primis
          invenias etiam disjecti membra poetae.”

     [“take away [[certain]] rhythms and measures, and make the word which
     was first in order come later, putting that which should be last
     first, you will still find the scattered remains of the poet.”
      --horace, sat., i. 4, 58.]

he will never the more lose himself for that; the very pieces will be
fine by themselves.  menander’s [[answer]] had this meaning, who being
reproved by a friend, the [[time]] drawing on at which he had promised a
comedy, that he had not yet fallen in hand with it; “it is made, and
ready,” said he, “all but the verses.”--[plutarch, whether the athenians
more excelled in arms or in letters.]--having contrived the [[subject]], and
disposed the scenes in his fancy, he took little [[care]] for the rest.
since ronsard and du bellay have given [[reputation]] to our french poesy,
every little dabbler, for aught i see, swells his words as high, and
makes his cadences very near as harmonious as they:

                    “plus sonat, quam valet.”

               [“more sound than sense”--seneca, ep., 40.]

for the vulgar, there were never so many poetasters as now; but though
they find it no hard matter to imitate their rhyme, they yet fall
infinitely short of imitating the [[rich]] descriptions of the one, and the
delicate invention of the other of these masters.

but what will become of our [[young]] gentleman, if he be attacked with the
sophistic subtlety of some syllogism?  “a westfalia ham makes a man
drink; drink quenches thirst: ergo a westfalia ham quenches thirst.”
 why, let him laugh at it; it will be more discretion to do so, than to go
about to [[answer]] it; or let him borrow this pleasant evasion from
aristippus:  “why should i trouble myself to untie that, which bound as
it is, gives me so much trouble?”--[diogenes laertius, ii. 70.]--
one offering at this dialectic juggling against cleanthes, chrysippus
took him short, saying, “reserve these baubles to play with [[children]],
and do not by such fooleries divert the serious thoughts [[thought]] of a [[man]] of
years.”  if these ridiculous subtleties,

               “contorta et aculeata sophismata,”

as cicero calls them, are designed to possess him with an untruth, they
are dangerous; but if they signify no more than only to make him laugh,
i do not see why a [[man]] need to be fortified against them.  there are some
so ridiculous, as to go a mile out of their way to hook in a fine word:

          “aut qui non verba rebus aptant, sed res extrinsecus
          arcessunt, quibus verba conveniant.”

     [“who do not fit words to the [[subject]], but seek out for things
     quite from the [[purpose]] to fit the words.”--quintilian, viii. 3.]

and as another says,

          “qui, alicujus verbi decore placentis, vocentur ad id,
          quod non proposuerant scribere.”

     [“who by their fondness of some fine sounding word, are tempted to
     something they had no intention to treat of.”--seneca, ep., 59.]

i for my part rather bring in a fine sentence by head and shoulders to
fit my [[purpose]], than divert my designs to hunt after a sentence.  on the
contrary, words are to serve, and to [[follow]] a man’s [[purpose]]; and let
gascon come in play where french will not do.  i would have things so
excelling, and so wholly possessing the [[imagination]] of him that hears,
that he should have something else to do, than to [[think]] of words.  the
way of speaking that i [[love]], is [[natural]] and plain, the same in writing as
in speaking, and a sinewy and muscular way of expressing a man’s [[self]],
short and pithy, not so elegant and artificial as prompt and vehement;

               “haec demum sapiet dictio, qux feriet;”

     [“that has most weight and [[wisdom]] which pierces the ear.” (“that
     utterance indeed will have a taste which shall strike the ear.”)
     --epitaph on lucan, in fabricius, biblioth.  lat., ii. 10.]

rather hard than wearisome; [[free]] from affectation; irregular,
incontinuous, and bold; where every piece makes up an entire [[body]]; not
like a pedant, a preacher, or a pleader, but rather a soldier-like style,
as suetonius calls that of julius caesar; and yet i see no [[reason]] why he
should call it so.  i have ever been ready to imitate the negligent garb,
which is yet observable amongst the [[young]] [[men]] of our [[time]], to wear my
cloak on one shoulder, my cap on one side, a stocking in disorder, which
seems to express a [[kind]] of haughty disdain of these exotic ornaments, and
a contempt of the artificial; but i find this negligence of much better
use in the form of speaking.  all affectation, particularly in the french
gaiety and [[freedom]], is ungraceful in a courtier, and in a [[monarchy]] every
gentleman ought to be fashioned according to the court model; for which
reason, an easy and [[natural]] negligence does well.  i no more like a web
where the knots and seams are to be seen, than a fine figure, so
delicate, that a [[man]] may tell all the bones and veins:

     “quae veritati operam dat oratio, incomposita sit et simplex.”

     [“let the [[language]] that is dedicated to [[truth]] be plain and
     unaffected.--seneca, ep. 40.]

          “quis accurat loquitur, nisi qui vult putide loqui?”

     [“for who studies to speak accurately, that does not at the same
     [[time]] [[wish]] to perplex his auditory?”--idem, ep., 75.]

that eloquence prejudices the [[subject]] it would advance, that wholly
attracts us to itself.  and as in our outward habit, ‘tis a ridiculous
effeminacy to distinguish ourselves by a particular and unusual garb or
fashion; so in [[language]], to study new phrases, and to affect words that
are not of current use, proceeds from a puerile and scholastic [[ambition]].
may i be bound to speak no other [[language]] than what is spoken in the
market-places of paris!  aristophanes the grammarian was quite out, when
he reprehended epicurus for his plain way of delivering himself, and the
design of his oratory, which was only perspicuity of [[speech]].
the imitation of words, by its own facility, immediately disperses itself
through a whole [[people]]; but the imitation of inventing and fitly applying
those words is of a slower [[progress]].  the generality of readers, for
having found a like robe, very mistakingly imagine they have the same
body and inside too, whereas [[force]] and sinews are never to be borrowed;
the gloss, and outward ornament, that is, words and elocution, may.  most
of those i converse with, speak the same [[language]] i here write; but
whether they [[think]] the same thoughts [[thought]] i cannot say.  the athenians, says
plato, study fulness and elegancy of speaking; the lacedaemonians affect
brevity, and those of crete to aim more at the fecundity of conception
than the fertility of [[speech]]; and these are the [[best]].  zeno used to say
that he had two sorts of disciples, one that he called cy-----ous,
curious to learn things, and these were his favourites; the other,
aoy---ous, that cared for nothing but words.  not that fine speaking is
not a very [[good]] and commendable quality; but not so excellent and so
necessary as some would make it; and i am scandalised that our whole life
should be spent in nothing else.  i would first [[understand]] my own
language, and that of my neighbours, with whom most of my [[business]] and
conversation lies [[lie]].

no [[doubt]] but [[greek]] and latin are very [[great]] ornaments, and of very great
use, but we buy them too dear.  i will here discover one way, which has
been experimented in my own [[person]], by which they are to be had better
cheap, and such may make use of it as will.  my late [[father]] having made
the most precise inquiry that any [[man]] could possibly make amongst [[men]] of
the [[greatest]] learning and [[judgment]], of an exact method of [[education]], was
by them cautioned of this inconvenience then in use, and made to [[believe]],
that the tedious [[time]] we applied to the learning of the tongues of them
who had them for nothing, was the sole cause we could not arrive to the
grandeur of [[soul]] and [[perfection]] of [[knowledge]], of the ancient greeks [[greek]] and
romans.  i do not, however, [[believe]] that to be the only cause.  so it is,
that the expedient my [[father]] found out for this was, that in my infancy,
and before i began to speak, he committed me to the [[care]] of a [[german]], who
since died a famous physician in [[france]], totally ignorant of our
language, and very fluent and a [[great]] critic in latin.  this [[man]], whom he
had fetched out of his own [[country]], and whom he entertained with a great
salary for this only one end, had me continually with him; he had with
him also joined two others, of inferior learning, to attend me, and to
relieve him; these spoke to me in no other [[language]] but latin.  as to the
rest of his household, it was an inviolable [[rule]], that neither himself,
nor my [[mother]], nor valet, nor chambermaid, should speak anything in my
company, but such latin words as each one had learned to gabble with me.
--[these passages are, the basis of a small volume by the abbe mangin:
“education de montaigne; ou, l’art d’enseigner le latin a l’instar des
meres latines.”]--it is not to be imagined how [[great]] an advantage this
proved to the whole [[family]]; my [[father]] and my [[mother]] by this means learned
latin enough to [[understand]] it perfectly well, and to speak it to such a
degree as was sufficient for any necessary use; as also those of the
servants did who were most frequently with me.  in short, we latined it
at such a rate, that it overflowed to all the neighbouring villages,
where there yet remain, that have established themselves by custom,
several latin appellations of artisans and their tools.  as for what
concerns myself, i was above six years of [[age]] before i understood either
french or perigordin, any more than arabic; and without art [[arts]], [[book]],
grammar, or precept, whipping, or the expense of a tear, i had, by that
time, learned to speak as pure latin as my master himself, for i had no
means of mixing it up with any other.  if, for [[example]], they were to give
me a theme after the college [[fashion]], they gave it to others in french;
but to me they were to give it in [[bad]] latin, to turn it into that which
was [[good]].  and nicolas grouchy, who wrote a [[book]] de comitiis romanorum;
guillaume guerente, who wrote a comment upon [[aristotle]]: george buchanan,
that [[great]] scottish poet: and marc antoine muret (whom both [[france]] and
italy have acknowledged for the [[best]] orator of his time), my domestic
tutors, have all of them often told me that i had in my infancy that
language so very fluent and ready, that they were afraid to enter into
discourse with me.  and particularly buchanan, whom i since saw attending
the late mareschal de brissac, then told me, that he was about to write a
treatise of [[education]], the [[example]] of which he intended to take from
mine; for he was then tutor to that comte de brissac who afterward proved
so valiant and so brave a gentleman.

as to [[greek]], of which i have but a mere smattering, my [[father]] also
designed to have it taught me by a device, but a new one, and by way of
sport; tossing our declensions to and fro, after the manner of those who,
by [[certain]] games of tables, learn geometry and arithmetic.  for he,
amongst other rules [[rule]], had been advised to make me relish [[science]] and duty
by an unforced will, and of my own voluntary motion, and to educate my
soul in all [[liberty]] and delight, without any severity or constraint;
which he was an observer of to such a [[degree]], even of superstition, if i
may say so, that some being of [[opinion]] that it troubles and disturbs the
brains of [[children]] suddenly to wake them in the morning, and to snatch
them violently--and over-hastily from sleep (wherein they are much more
profoundly involved than we), he caused me to be wakened by the sound of
some musical instrument, and was never unprovided of a musician for that
purpose.  by this [[example]] you may [[judge]] of the rest, this alone being
sufficient to recommend both the prudence and the affection of so [[good]] a
father, who is not to be blamed if he did not reap fruits answerable to
so exquisite a [[culture]].  of this, two things were the cause: first, a
sterile and improper soil; for, though i was of a [[strong]] and healthful
constitution, and of a disposition tolerably sweet and tractable, yet i
was, withal, so heavy, idle, and indisposed, that they could not rouse me
from my sloth, not even to get me out to play.  what i saw, i saw clearly
enough, and under this heavy [[complexion]] nourished a bold [[imagination]] and
opinions above my [[age]].  i had a slow wit that would go no faster than it
was [[led]]; a tardy understanding, a languishing invention, and above all,
incredible defect of memory; so that, it is no wonder, if from all these
nothing considerable could be extracted.  secondly, like those who,
impatient of along and steady cure, submit to all sorts of prescriptions
and recipes, the [[good]] [[man]] being extremely timorous of any way failing in
a thing he had so wholly set his [[heart]] upon, [[suffered]] himself at [[last]] to
be overruled by the [[common]] opinions [[opinion]], which always [[follow]] their leader as
a flight of cranes, and complying with the method of the [[time]], having no
more those persons [[person]] he had brought out of [[italy]], and who had given him the
first model of [[education]], about him, he sent me at six years of [[age]] to
the college of guienne, at that [[time]] the [[best]] and most flourishing in
france.  and there it was not possible to add anything to the [[care]] he had
to provide me the most able tutors, with all other circumstances of
education, reserving also several particular rules [[rule]] contrary to the
college practice; but so it was, that with all these precautions, it was
a college still.  my latin immediately grew [[corrupt]], of which also by
discontinuance i have since lost all manner of use; so that this new way
of [[education]] served me to no other end, than only at my first coming to
prefer me to the first forms; for at thirteen years old, that i came out
of the college, i had run through my whole course (as they call it), and,
in [[truth]], without any manner of advantage, that i can honestly brag of,
in all this [[time]].

the first taste which i had for books [[book]] came to me from the [[pleasure]] in
reading the fables of ovid’s metamorphoses; for, being about seven or
eight years old, i gave up all other diversions to [[read]] them, both by
reason that this was my own [[natural]] [[language]], the easiest [[book]] that i was
acquainted with, and for the [[subject]], the most accommodated to the
capacity of my [[age]]: for as for the lancelot of the lake, the amadis of
gaul, the huon of bordeaux, and such farragos, by which [[children]] are most
delighted with, i had never so much as heard their names, no more than i
yet [[know]] what they contain; so exact was the discipline wherein i was
brought up.  but this was enough to make me neglect the other lessons
that were prescribed me; and here it was infinitely to my advantage,
to have to do with an understanding tutor, who very well knew discreetly
to connive at this and other truantries of the same [[nature]]; for by this
means i ran through virgil’s aeneid, and then terence, and then plautus,
and then some italian comedies, allured by the sweetness of the [[subject]];
whereas had he been so foolish as to have taken me off this diversion,
i do really [[believe]], i had brought away nothing from the college but a
hatred of books [[book]], as almost all our [[young]] gentlemen do.  but he carried
himself very discreetly in that [[business]], seeming to take no notice, and
allowing me only such [[time]] as i could steal from my other regular
studies, which whetted my appetite to devour those books [[book]].  for the chief
things my [[father]] expected from their endeavours to whom he had delivered
me for [[education]], were affability and good-humour; and, to say the [[truth]],
my manners had no other [[vice]] but sloth and want of metal.  the [[fear]] was
not that i should do ill, but that i should do nothing; nobody
prognosticated that i should be wicked, but only useless; they foresaw
idleness, but no malice; and i find it falls out accordingly:
the complaints i hear of myself are these: “he is idle, cold in the
offices of [[friendship]] and relation, and in those of the [[public]], too
particular, too disdainful.”  but the most injurious do not say, “why has
he taken such a thing?  why has he not paid such an one?”  but, “why does
he part with nothing?  why does he not give?”  and i should take it for a
favour that [[men]] would expect from me no greater effects of supererogation
than these.  but they are [[unjust]] to exact from me what i do not owe, far
more rigorously than they require from others that which they do owe.
in condemning me to it, they efface the gratification of the action, and
deprive me of the gratitude that would be my due for it; whereas the
active well-doing ought to be of so much the greater value from my hands,
by how much i have never been passive that way at all.  i can the more
freely dispose of my [[fortune]] the more it is mine, and of myself the more
i am my own.  nevertheless, if i were [[good]] at setting out my own actions,
i could, peradventure, very well repel these reproaches, and could give
some to [[understand]], that they are not so much offended, that i do not
enough, as that i am able to do a [[great]] deal more than i do.

yet for all this heavy disposition of mine, my [[mind]], when retired into
itself, was not altogether without [[strong]] movements, solid and clear
judgments about those objects it could comprehend, and could also,
without any helps, digest them; but, amongst other things, i do really
believe, it had been totally impossible to have made it to submit by
violence and [[force]].  shall i here acquaint you with one faculty of my
youth?  i had [[great]] assurance of countenance, and flexibility of voice
and gesture, in applying myself to any part i undertook to act: for
before--

          “alter ab undecimo tum me vix ceperat annus,”

     [“i had just entered my twelfth year.”--virgil, bucol., 39.]

i played the [[chief]] parts in the latin tragedies of buchanan, guerente,
and muret, that were presented in our college of guienne with great
dignity: now andreas goveanus, our principal, as in all other parts of
his charge, was, without comparison, the [[best]] of that employment in
france; and i was looked upon as one of the [[best]] actors.  ‘tis an
exercise that i do not disapprove in [[young]] [[people]] of condition; and i
have since seen our princes [[prince]], after the [[example]] of some of the ancients,
in [[person]] handsomely and commendably perform these exercises; it was even
allowed to persons [[person]] of quality to make a profession of it in greece.

          “aristoni tragico actori rem aperit: huic et genus et
          fortuna honesta erant: nec ars, quia nihil tale apud
          graecos pudori est, ea deformabat.”

     [“he imparted this matter to aristo the tragedian; a [[man]] of good
     [[family]] and [[fortune]], which neither of them receive any blemish by
     that profession; nothing of this [[kind]] being reputed a disparagement
     in greece.”--livy, xxiv. 24.]

nay, i have always taxed those with impertinence who condemn these
entertainments, and with [[injustice]] those who refuse to admit such
comedians as are worth seeing into our [[good]] towns, and grudge the people
that [[public]] diversion.  well-governed corporations take [[care]] to assemble
their [[citizens]], not only to the solemn duties [[duty]] of devotion, but also to
sports and spectacles.  they find [[society]] and [[friendship]] augmented by it;
and besides, can there possibly be allowed a more orderly and regular
diversion than what is performed m the sight of every one, and very often
in the presence of the supreme magistrate himself?  and i, for my part,
should [[think]] it reasonable, that the [[prince]] should sometimes gratify his
people at his own expense, out of paternal goodness and affection; and
that in populous cities [[city]] there should be theatres erected for such
entertainments, if but to divert them from worse and private actions.

to return to my [[subject]], there is nothing like alluring the appetite and
affections; otherwise you make nothing but so many asses laden with
books; by dint of the lash, you give them their pocketful of learning to
keep; whereas, to do well you should not only lodge it with them, but
make them espouse it.




chapter xxvi

that it is folly to measure [[truth]] and error by our own capacity

‘tis not, perhaps, without [[reason]], that we attribute facility of belief
and easiness of persuasion to simplicity and ignorance: for i fancy i
have heard [[belief]] compared to the impression of a seal upon the [[soul]],
which by how much softer and of less [[resistance]] it is, is the more easy
to be impressed upon.

         “ut necesse est, lancem in libra, ponderibus impositis,
          deprimi, sic animum perspicuis cedere.”

     [“as the scale of the balance must give way to the weight that
     presses it down, so the [[mind]] yields to demonstration.”
      --cicero, acad., ii. 12.]

by how much the [[soul]] is more empty and without counterpoise, with so much
greater facility it yields under the weight of the first persuasion.  and
this is the [[reason]] that [[children]], the [[common]] [[people]], [[women]], and sick
folks, are most apt to be [[led]] by the ears.  but then, on the other hand,
‘tis a foolish presumption to slight and condemn all things for false
that do not appear to us probable; which is the ordinary [[vice]] of such as
fancy themselves wiser than their neighbours.  i was myself once one of
those; and if i heard talk of [[dead]] folks walking, of prophecies,
enchantments, witchcrafts, or any other story i had no [[mind]] to [[believe]]:

              “somnia, terrores magicos, miracula, sagas,
               nocturnos lemures, portentaque thessala,”

     [“dreams, magic terrors, marvels, sorceries, thessalian prodigies.”
      --horace.  ep. ii. 3, 208.]

i presently pitied the [[poor]] [[people]] that were abused by these follies.
whereas i now find, that i myself was to be pitied as much, at least,
as they; not that [[experience]] has taught me anything to alter my former
opinions, though my curiosity has endeavoured that way; but [[reason]] has
instructed me, that thus resolutely to condemn anything for false and
impossible, is arrogantly and impiously to circumscribe and limit the
will of [[god]], and the [[power]] of our [[mother]] [[nature]], within the bounds of my
own capacity, than which no folly can be greater.  if we give the names
of monster and miracle to everything our [[reason]] cannot comprehend, how
many are continually presented before our [[eyes]]?  let us but consider
through what clouds, and as it were groping in the dark, our teachers
lead us to the [[knowledge]] of most of the things about us; assuredly we
shall find that it is rather custom than [[knowledge]] that takes away their
strangeness--

                    “jam nemo, fessus saturusque videndi,
               suspicere in coeli dignatur lucida templa;”

     [“weary of the sight, now no one deigns to look up to heaven’s lucid
     temples.”--lucretius, ii.  1037.  the text has ‘statiate videnai’]

and that if those things were now newly presented to us, we should think
them as incredible, if not more, than any others.

              “si nunc primum mortalibus adsint
               ex improviso, si sint objecta repente,
               nil magis his rebus poterat mirabile dici,
               aute minus ante quod auderent fore credere gentes.”

     [lucretius, ii. 1032.  the sense of the passage is in the preceding
     sentence.]

he that had never seen a river, imagined the first he met with to be the
sea; and the [[greatest]] things that have fallen within our [[knowledge]], we
conclude the extremes that [[nature]] makes of the [[kind]].

              “scilicet et fluvius qui non est maximus, ei’st
               qui non ante aliquem majorem vidit; et ingens
               arbor, homoque videtur, et omnia de genere omni
               maxima quae vidit quisque, haec ingentia fingit.”

     [“a little river seems to him, who has never seen a larger river, a
     mighty stream; and so with other things--a tree, a man--anything
     appears [[greatest]] to him that never knew a greater.”--idem, vi. 674.]

         “consuetudine oculorum assuescunt animi, neque admirantur,
          neque requirunt rationes earum rerum, quas semper vident.”

     [“things grow familiar to [[men’s]] minds [[mind]] by being often seen; so that
     they neither [[admire]] nor are they inquisitive about things they daily
     see.”--cicero, de natura deor., lib. ii. 38.]

the novelty, rather than the greatness of things, tempts us to inquire
into their causes.  we are to [[judge]] with more reverence, and with greater
acknowledgment of our own ignorance and infirmity, of the infinite power
of [[nature]].  how many unlikely things are there testified by [[people]] worthy
of [[faith]], which, if we cannot persuade ourselves absolutely to [[believe]],
we ought at least to leave them in suspense; for, to condemn them as
impossible, is by a temerarious presumption to pretend to [[know]] the utmost
bounds of possibility.  did we rightly [[understand]] the difference betwixt
the impossible and the unusual, and betwixt that which is contrary to the
order and course of [[nature]] and contrary to the [[common]] [[opinion]] of [[men]], in
not believing rashly, and on the other hand, in not being too
incredulous, we should observe the [[rule]] of ‘ne quid nimis’ enjoined by
chilo.

when we find in froissart, that the comte de foix  knew in bearn the
defeat of john, [[king]] of castile, at jubera the next day after it
happened, and the means by which he tells us he came to do so, we may be
allowed to be a little merry at it, as also at what our annals report,
that [[pope]] honorius, the same day that [[king]] philip augustus died at
mantes, performed his [[public]] obsequies at [[rome]], and commanded the like
throughout [[italy]], the testimony of these authors not being, perhaps, of
authority enough to restrain us.  but what if plutarch, besides several
examples that he produces [[produce]] out of antiquity, tells us, he knows [[know]] of certain
knowledge, that in the [[time]] of domitian, the news of the [[battle]] lost by
antony in germany was published at [[rome]], many days’ [[journey]] from thence,
and dispersed throughout the whole [[world]], the same day it was fought;
and if caesar was of [[opinion]], that it has often happened, that the report
has preceded the incident, shall we not say, that these simple people
have [[suffered]] themselves to be deceived with the vulgar, for not having
been so clear-sighted as we?  is there anything more delicate, more
clear, more sprightly; than pliny’s [[judgment]], when he is pleased to set
it to [[work]]?  anything more remote from vanity?  setting aside his
learning, of which i make less account, in which of these excellences do
any of us excel him?  and yet there is scarce a [[young]] schoolboy that does
not convict him of untruth, and that pretends not to instruct him in the
progress of the works [[work]] of [[nature]].  when we [[read]] in bouchet the [[miracles]] of
st. hilary’s relics, away with them: his [[authority]] is not sufficient to
deprive us of the [[liberty]] of contradicting him; but generally and offhand
to condemn all suchlike stories, seems to me a singular impudence.  that
great st. augustin’ testifies to have seen a blind child recover sight
upon the relics of st. gervasius and st. protasius at milan; a woman at
carthage cured of a cancer, by the sign of the cross made upon her by a
woman newly baptized; hesperius, a familiar friend of his, to have driven
away the spirits that haunted his house, with a little [[earth]] of the
sepulchre of our [[lord]]; which [[earth]], being also transported thence into
the [[church]], a paralytic to have there been suddenly cured by it; a woman
in a procession, having touched st. stephen’s shrine with a nosegay, and
rubbing her [[eyes]] with it, to have recovered her sight, lost many years
before; with several other [[miracles]] of which he professes himself to have
been an eyewitness: of what shall we excuse him and the two holy bishops,
aurelius and maximinus, both of whom he attests to the [[truth]] of these
things?  shall it be of ignorance, simplicity, and facility; or of malice
and imposture?  is any [[man]] now living so impudent as to [[think]] himself
comparable to them in [[virtue]], piety, learning, [[judgment]], or any [[kind]] of
perfection?

              “qui, ut rationem nullam afferrent,
               ipsa auctoritate me frangerent.”


     [“who, though they should adduce no [[reason]], would convince me with
     their [[authority]] alone.”--cicero, tusc. quaes, i. 21.]

‘tis a presumption of [[great]] danger and consequence, besides the absurd
temerity it draws after it, to contemn what we do not comprehend.  for
after, according to your fine understanding, you have established the
limits of [[truth]] and error, and that, afterwards, there appears a
necessity upon you of believing stranger things than those you have
contradicted, you are already obliged to quit your limits.  now, that
which seems to me so much to disorder our consciences in the commotions
we are now in concerning [[religion]], is the catholics dispensing so much
with their [[belief]].  they fancy they appear moderate, and [[wise]], when they
grant to their opponents some of the articles in [[question]]; but, besides
that they do not discern what advantage it is to those with whom we
contend, to begin to give ground and to retire, and how much this
animates our [[enemy]] to [[follow]] his blow: these articles which they select
as things indifferent, are sometimes of very [[great]] importance.  we are
either wholly and absolutely to submit ourselves to the [[authority]] of our
ecclesiastical polity, or totally throw off all [[obedience]] to it: ‘tis not
for us to determine what and how much [[obedience]] we owe to it.  and this i
can say, as having myself made [[trial]] of it, that having formerly taken
the [[liberty]] of my own swing and fancy, and omitted or neglected certain
rules of the discipline of our [[church]], which seemed to me [[vain]] and
strange coming afterwards to discourse of it with learned [[men]], i have
found those same things to be built upon very [[good]] and solid ground and
strong foundation; and that nothing but stupidity and ignorance makes us
receive them with less reverence than the rest.  why do we not consider
what contradictions we find in our own judgments [[judgment]]; how many things were
yesterday articles of our [[faith]], that to-day appear no other than fables?
glory and curiosity are the scourges of the [[soul]]; the [[last]] prompts us to
thrust our noses into everything, the other forbids us to leave anything
doubtful and undecided.

chapter xxvii

of friendship

having considered the proceedings of a painter that serves me, i had a
mind to imitate his way.  he chooses the fairest place and middle of any
wall, or panel, wherein to draw a picture, which he finishes with his
utmost [[care]] and art [[arts]], and the vacuity about it he fills with grotesques,
which are odd fantastic figures without any grace but what they derive
from their variety, and the extravagance of their shapes.  and in [[truth]],
what are these things i scribble, other than grotesques and monstrous
bodies, made of various parts, without any [[certain]] figure, or any other
than accidental order, coherence, or proportion?

               “desinit in piscem mulier formosa superne.”

          [“a [[fair]] woman in her upper form terminates in a fish.”
           --horace, de arte poetica, v. 4.]

in this second part i go hand in hand with my painter; but fall very
short of him in the first and the [[better]], my [[power]] of handling not being
such, that i dare to offer at a [[rich]] piece, finely polished, and set off
according to art [[arts]].  i have therefore [[thought]] fit to borrow one of estienne
de la boetie, and such a one as shall [[honour]] and adorn all the rest of my
work--namely, a discourse that he called ‘voluntary servitude’; but,
since, those who did not [[know]] him have properly enough called it “le
contr un.”  he wrote in his [[youth]],--[“not being as yet eighteen years
old.”--edition of 1588.] by way of essay, in [[honour]] of [[liberty]] against
tyrants; and it has since run through the hands of [[men]] of [[great]] learning
and [[judgment]], not without singular and merited commendation; for it is
finely written, and as full as anything can possibly be.  and yet one may
confidently say it is far short of what he was able to do; and if in that
more mature [[age]], wherein i had the [[happiness]] to [[know]] him, he had taken a
design like this of mine, to commit his thoughts [[thought]] to writing, we should
have seen a [[great]] many rare things, and such as would have gone very near
to have rivalled the [[best]] writings of antiquity: for in [[natural]] parts
especially, i [[know]] no [[man]] comparable to him.  but he has left nothing
behind him, save this treatise only (and that too by [[chance]], for i
believe he never saw it after it first went out of his hands), and some
observations upon that edict of january--[1562, which granted to the
huguenots the [[public]] exercise of their [[religion]].]--made famous by our
civil-wars, which also shall elsewhere, peradventure, find a place.
these were all i could recover of his remains, i to whom with so
affectionate a remembrance, upon his death-bed, he by his [[last]] will
bequeathed his library and papers, the little [[book]] of his works [[work]] only
excepted, which i committed to the press.  and this particular obligation
i have to this treatise of his, that it was the [[occasion]] of my first
coming acquainted with him; for it was showed to me long before i had the
good [[fortune]] to [[know]] him; and the first [[knowledge]] of his name, proving
the first cause and foundation of a [[friendship]], which we afterwards
improved and maintained, so long as [[god]] was pleased to continue us
together, so [[perfect]], inviolate, and entire, that certainly the like is
hardly to be found in story, and amongst the [[men]] of this [[age]], there is no
sign nor trace of any such thing in use; so much concurrence is required
to the building of such a one, that ‘tis much, if [[fortune]] bring it but
once to pass in three ages [[age]].

there is nothing to which [[nature]] seems so much to have inclined us, as to
society; and [[aristotle]] , says that the [[good]] legislators had more respect
to [[friendship]] than to [[justice]].  now the most supreme point of its
perfection is this: for, generally, all those that [[pleasure]], [[profit]],
public or private interest create and nourish, are so much the less
beautiful and generous, and so much the less friendships [[friendship]], by how much
they mix another cause, and design, and fruit in [[friendship]], than itself.
neither do the four ancient kinds [[kind]], [[natural]], social, hospitable, venereal,
either separately or jointly, make up a true and [[perfect]] [[friendship]].

that of [[children]] to parents is rather [[respect]]: [[friendship]] is nourished by
communication, which cannot by [[reason]] of the [[great]] disparity, be betwixt
these, but would rather perhaps offend the duties [[duty]] of [[nature]]; for neither
are all the secret thoughts [[thought]] of fathers [[father]] fit to be communicated to
children, lest it beget an indecent familiarity betwixt them; nor can the
advices and reproofs, which is one of the principal offices of
friendship, be properly performed by the [[son]] to the [[father]].  there are
some countries [[country]] where ‘twas the custom for [[children]] to kill their fathers [[father]];
and others, where the fathers [[father]] killed their [[children]], to avoid their being
an impediment one to another in [[life]]; and naturally the expectations of
the one depend upon the ruin of the other.  there have been great
philosophers who have made nothing of this tie of [[nature]], as aristippus
for one, who being pressed [[home]] about the affection he owed to his
children, as being come out of him, presently fell to spit, saying, that
this also came out of him, and that we also breed worms and lice; and
that other, that plutarch endeavoured to reconcile to his [[brother]]:
“i make never the more account of him,” said he, “for coming out of the
same hole.”  this name of [[brother]] does indeed carry with it a fine and
delectable sound, and for that [[reason]], he and i called one another
brothers but the complication of interests, the division of estates, and
that the [[wealth]] of the one should be the [[property]] of the other, strangely
relax and weaken the fraternal tie: brothers [[brother]] pursuing their [[fortune]] and
advancement by the same path, ‘tis hardly possible but they must of
necessity often jostle and hinder one another.  besides, why is it
necessary that the correspondence of manners, parts, and inclinations,
which begets the true and [[perfect]] friendships [[friendship]], should always meet in
these relations?  the [[father]] and the [[son]] may be of quite contrary
humours, and so of brothers [[brother]]: he is my [[son]], he is my [[brother]]; but he is
passionate, ill-natured, or a [[fool]].  and moreover, by how much these are
friendships that the [[law]] and [[natural]] obligation impose upon us, so much
less is there of our own [[choice]] and voluntary [[freedom]]; whereas that
voluntary [[liberty]] of ours has no production more promptly and; properly
its own than affection and [[friendship]].  not that i have not in my own
person experimented all that can possibly be expected of that [[kind]],
having had the [[best]] and most indulgent [[father]], even to his extreme old
age, that ever was, and who was himself descended from a [[family]] for many
generations famous and exemplary for brotherly concord:

                                   “et ipse
                    notus in fratres animi paterni.”

     [“and i myself, known for paternal [[love]] toward my brothers [[brother]].”
      --horace, ode, ii. 2, 6.]

we are not here to bring the [[love]] we bear to [[women]], though it be an act
of our own [[choice]], into comparison, nor rank it with the others.  the
fire of this, i confess,

                   “neque enim est dea nescia nostri
                    qux dulcem curis miscet amaritiem,”

     [“nor is the [[goddess]] unknown to me who mixes a sweet bitterness
     with my [[love]].”---catullus, lxviii. 17.]

is more active, more eager, and more sharp: but withal, ‘tis more
precipitant, fickle, moving, and inconstant; a fever [[subject]] to
intermissions and paroxysms, that has seized but on one part of us.
whereas in [[friendship]], ‘tis a general and universal [[fire]], but temperate
and [[equal]], a constant established heat, all gentle and smooth, without
poignancy or roughness.  moreover, in [[love]], ‘tis no other than frantic
desire for that which flies from us:

              “come segue la lepre il cacciatore
               al freddo, al caldo, alla montagna, al lito;
               ne piu l’estima poi the presa vede;
               e sol dietro a chi fugge affretta il piede”

     [“as the hunter pursues the hare, in cold and heat, to the mountain,
     to the shore, nor cares [[care]] for it farther when he sees it taken, and
     only delights in chasing that which flees from him.”--aristo, x. 7.]

so soon as it enters unto the terms of [[friendship]], that is to say, into a
concurrence of desires [[desire]], it vanishes and is gone, fruition destroys it,
as having only a fleshly end, and such a one as is [[subject]] to satiety.
friendship, on the contrary, is enjoyed proportionably as it is [[desired]];
and only grows up, is nourished and improved by enjoyment, as being of
itself [[spiritual]], and the [[soul]] growing still more refined by practice.
under this [[perfect]] [[friendship]], the other fleeting affections have in my
younger years found some place in me, to say nothing of him, who himself
so confesses but too much in his verses; so that i had both these
passions, but always so, that i could myself well enough distinguish
them, and never in any [[degree]] of comparison with one another; the first
maintaining its flight in so lofty and so brave a place, as with disdain
to look down, and see the other flying at a far humbler pitch below.

as concerning [[marriage]], besides that it is a covenant, the entrance into
which only is [[free]], but the continuance in it forced and compulsory,
having another dependence than that of our own [[free]] will, and a bargain
commonly contracted to other ends, there almost always happens a thousand
intricacies in it to unravel, enough to break the thread and to divert
the current of a lively affection: whereas [[friendship]] has no manner of
business or traffic with aught but itself.  moreover, to say [[truth]], the
ordinary talent of [[women]] is not such as is sufficient to maintain the
conference and communication required to the support of this [[sacred]] tie;
nor do they appear to be endued with constancy of [[mind]], to sustain the
pinch of so hard and durable a knot.  and doubtless, if without this,
there could be such a [[free]] and voluntary familiarity contracted, where
not only the souls [[soul]] might have this entire fruition, but the bodies [[body]] also
might share in the [[alliance]], and a [[man]] be engaged throughout, the
friendship would certainly be more full and [[perfect]]; but it is without
example that this [[sex]] has ever yet arrived at such [[perfection]]; and, by
the [[common]] [[consent]] of the ancient schools, it is wholly rejected from it.

that other grecian licence is justly abhorred by our manners, which also,
from having, according to their practice, a so necessary disparity of age
and difference of offices betwixt the lovers, answered no more to the
perfect union and harmony that we here require than the other:

         “quis est enim iste amor amicitiae? cur neque deformem
          adolescentem quisquam amat, neque formosum senem?”

     [“for what is that friendly [[love]]? why does no one [[love]] a deformed
     [[youth]] or a comely old [[man]]?”--cicero, tusc.  quaes., iv. 33.]

neither will that very picture that the academy presents [[present]] of it, as i
conceive, contradict me, when i say, that this first fury inspired by the
son of [[venus]] into the [[heart]] of the lover, upon sight of the flower and
prime of a springing and blossoming [[youth]], to which they allow all the
insolent and passionate efforts that an immoderate ardour can [[produce]],
was simply founded upon external [[beauty]], the false image of corporal
generation; for it could not ground this [[love]] upon the [[soul]], the sight of
which as yet lay concealed, was but now springing, and not of maturity to
blossom; that this fury, if it seized upon a low spirit, the means by
which it preferred its suit were [[rich]] presents [[present]], favour in advancement to
dignities, and such trumpery, which they by no means approve; if on a
more generous [[soul]], the pursuit was suitably generous, by philosophical
instructions, precepts to revere [[religion]], to obey the laws [[law]], to [[die]] for
the [[good]] of one’s [[country]]; by examples [[example]] of valour, prudence, and [[justice]],
the lover studying to render himself acceptable by the grace and beauty
of the [[soul]], that of his [[body]] being long since faded and decayed, hoping
by this mental [[society]] to establish a more firm and lasting contract.
when this courtship came to effect in due season (for that which they do
not require in the lover, namely, leisure and discretion in his pursuit,
they strictly require in the [[person]] loved, forasmuch as he is to [[judge]] of
an internal [[beauty]], of difficult [[knowledge]] and abstruse discovery), then
there sprung in the [[person]] loved the [[desire]] of a [[spiritual]] conception;
by the mediation of a [[spiritual]] [[beauty]].  this was the principal; the
corporeal, an accidental and secondary matter; quite the contrary as to
the lover.  for this [[reason]] they prefer the [[person]] beloved, maintaining
that the gods in like manner preferred him too, and very much blame the
poet aeschylus for having, in the loves [[love]] of achilles and patroclus, given
the lover’s part to achilles, who was in the first and beardless flower
of his adolescence, and the handsomest of all the greeks [[greek]].  after this
general [[community]], the [[sovereign]], and most worthy part presiding and
governing, and performing its proper offices, they say, that thence great
utility was derived, both by private and [[public]] concerns; that it
constituted the [[force]] and [[power]] of the countries [[country]] where it prevailed, and
the chiefest security of [[liberty]] and [[justice]].  of which the healthy loves
of harmodius and aristogiton are instances.  and therefore it is that
they called it [[sacred]] and [[divine]], and conceive that nothing but the
violence of tyrants [[tyrant]] and the baseness of the [[common]] [[people]] are inimical to
it.  finally, all that can be said in favour of the academy is, that it
was a [[love]] which ended in [[friendship]], which well enough agrees with the
stoical definition of [[love]]:

              “amorem conatum esse amicitiae faciendae
               ex pulchritudinis specie.”

     [“love is a [[desire]] of contracting [[friendship]] arising from the beauty
     of the object.”--cicero, tusc. quaes., vi. 34.]

i return to my own more just and true description:

          “omnino amicitiae, corroboratis jam confirmatisque,
          et ingeniis, et aetatibus, judicandae sunt.”

     [“those are only to be reputed friendships [[friendship]] that are fortified and
     confirmed by judgement and the length of [[time]].”
      --cicero, de amicit., c. 20.]

for the rest, what we commonly call [[friends]] and friendships [[friendship]], are nothing
but acquaintance and familiarities, either occasionally contracted, or
upon some design, by means of which there happens some little intercourse
betwixt our souls [[soul]].  but in the [[friendship]] i speak of, they mix and work
themselves into one piece, with so universal a mixture, that there is no
more sign of the seam by which they were first conjoined.  if a man
should importune me to give a [[reason]] why i loved him, i find it could no
otherwise be expressed, than by making [[answer]]: because it was he, because
it was i.  there is, beyond all that i am able to say, i [[know]] not what
inexplicable and fated [[power]] that brought on this union.  we sought one
another long before we met, and by the characters [[character]] we heard of one
another, which wrought upon our affections more than, in [[reason]], mere
reports should do; i [[think]] ‘twas by some secret appointment of [[heaven]].
we embraced in our names; and at our first meeting, which was
accidentally at a [[great]] [[city]] entertainment, we found ourselves so
mutually taken with one another, so acquainted, and so endeared betwixt
ourselves, that from thenceforward nothing was so near to us as one
another.  he wrote an excellent latin satire, since printed, wherein he
excuses the precipitation of our [[intelligence]], so suddenly come to
perfection, saying, that destined to have so short a continuance, as
begun so late (for we were both full-grown [[men]], and he some years the
older), there was no [[time]] to lose, nor were we tied to conform to the
example of those slow and regular friendships [[friendship]], that require so many
precautions of long preliminary conversation: this has no other [[idea]] than
that of itself, and can only refer to itself: this is no one special
consideration, nor two, nor three, nor four, nor a thousand; ‘tis i know
not what quintessence of all this mixture, which, seizing my whole will,
carried it to plunge and lose itself in his, and that having seized his
whole will, brought it back with [[equal]] concurrence and appetite to plunge
and lose itself in mine.  i may truly say lose, reserving nothing to
ourselves that was either his or mine.--[all this relates to estienne de
la boetie.]

when laelius,--[cicero, de amicit., c. ii.]--in the presence of the
roman consuls, who after thay had sentenced tiberius gracchus, prosecuted
all those who had had any familiarity with him also; came to ask caius
blosius, who was his chiefest friend, how much he would have done for
him, and that he made [[answer]]:  “all things.”--“how!  all things!”  said
laelius.  “and what if he had commanded you to [[fire]] our temples?”--“he
would never have commanded me that,” replied blosius.--“but what if he
had?” said laelius.--“i would have obeyed him,” said the other.  if he
was so [[perfect]] a friend to gracchus as the histories [[history]] report him to have
been, there was yet no necessity of offending the consuls by such a bold
confession, though he might still have retained the assurance he had of
gracchus’ disposition.  however, those who accuse this [[answer]] as
seditious, do not well [[understand]] the mystery; nor presuppose, as it was
true, that he had gracchus’ will in his sleeve, both by the [[power]] of a
friend, and the [[perfect]] [[knowledge]] he had of the [[man]]: they were more
friends than [[citizens]], more [[friends]] to one another than either enemies [[enemy]] or
friends to their [[country]], or than [[friends]] to [[ambition]] and innovation;
having absolutely given up themselves to one another, either held
absolutely the reins of the other’s inclination; and suppose all this
guided by [[virtue]], and all this by the conduct of [[reason]], which also
without these it had not been possible to do, blosius’ [[answer]] was such as
it ought to be.  if any of their actions flew out of the handle, they
were neither (according to my measure of friendship) [[friends]] to one
another, nor to themselves.  as to the rest, this [[answer]] carries no worse
sound, than mine would do to one that should ask me: “if your will should
command you to kill your [[daughter]], would you do it?” and that i should
make [[answer]], that i would; for this expresses no [[consent]] to such an act,
forasmuch as i do not in the least suspect my own will, and as little
that of such a friend.  ‘tis not in the [[power]] of all the eloquence in the
world, to dispossess me of the certainty i have of the intentions and
resolutions of my friend; nay, no one action of his, what face soever it
might bear, could be presented to me, of which i could not presently,
and at first sight, find out the moving cause.  our souls [[soul]] had drawn so
unanimously together, they had considered each other with so ardent an
affection, and with the like affection laid open the very bottom of our
hearts to one another’s view, that i not only knew his as well as my own;
but should certainly in any concern of mine have trusted my interest much
more willingly with him, than with myself.

let no one, therefore, rank other [[common]] friendships [[friendship]] with such a one as
this.  i have had as much [[experience]] of these as another, and of the most
perfect of their [[kind]]: but i do not advise that any should confound the
rules of the one and the other, for they would find themselves much
deceived.  in those other ordinary friendships [[friendship]], you are to walk with
bridle in your hand, with prudence and circumspection, for in them the
knot is not so sure that a [[man]] may not half suspect it will slip.  “love
him,” said chilo,--[aulus gellius, i. 3.]--“so as if you were one day to
hate him; and hate him so as you were one day to [[love]] him.”  this
precept, though abominable in the [[sovereign]] and [[perfect]] [[friendship]] i
speak of, is nevertheless very sound as to the practice of the ordinary
and customary ones, and to which the saying that [[aristotle]] had so
frequent in his mouth, “o my [[friends]], there is no friend,” may very fitly
be applied.  in this [[noble]] commerce, [[good]] offices, presents [[present]], and
benefits, by which other friendships [[friendship]] are supported and maintained, do not
deserve so much as to be mentioned; and the [[reason]] is the concurrence of
our wills; for, as the [[kindness]] i have for myself receives no increase,
for anything i relieve myself withal in [[time]] of need (whatever the stoics
say), and as i do not find myself obliged to myself for any service i do
myself: so the union of such [[friends]], being truly [[perfect]], deprives them
of all [[idea]] of such duties [[duty]], and makes them loathe and banish from their
conversation these words of division and distinction, benefits,
obligation, acknowledgment, entreaty, thanks, and the like.  all things,
wills, thoughts [[thought]], opinions [[opinion]], goods [[good]], wives [[wife]], [[children]], honours [[honour]], and lives [[life]],
being in effect [[common]] betwixt them, and that absolute concurrence of
affections being no other than one [[soul]] in two bodies [[body]] (according to that
very proper definition of aristotle), they can neither lend nor give
anything to one another.  this is the [[reason]] why the lawgivers, to honour
marriage with some resemblance of this [[divine]] [[alliance]], interdict all
gifts betwixt [[man]] and [[wife]]; inferring by that, that all should belong to
each of them, and that they have nothing to divide or to give to each
other.

if, in the [[friendship]] of which i speak, one could give to the other, the
receiver of the benefit would be the [[man]] that obliged his friend; for
each of them contending and above all things studying how to be useful to
the other, he that administers the [[occasion]] is the liberal [[man]], in giving
his friend the satisfaction of doing that towards him which above all
things he most desires [[desire]].  when the philosopher diogenes wanted [[money]], he
used to say, that he redemanded it of his [[friends]], not that he demanded
it.  and to let you see the practical working of this, i will here
produce an ancient and singular [[example]].  eudamidas, a corinthian, had
two [[friends]], charixenus a sicyonian and areteus a corinthian; this man
coming to [[die]], being [[poor]], and his two [[friends]] [[rich]], he made his will
after this manner.  “i bequeath to areteus the maintenance of my [[mother]],
to support and provide for her in her old [[age]]; and to charixenus i
bequeath the [[care]] of marrying my [[daughter]], and to give her as [[good]] a
portion as he is able; and in case one of these [[chance]] to [[die]], i hereby
substitute the survivor in his place.”  they who first saw this will made
themselves very merry at the contents: but the legatees, being made
acquainted with it, accepted it with very [[great]] content; and one of them,
charixenus, dying within five days after, and by that means the charge of
both duties [[duty]] devolving solely on him, areteus nurtured the old woman with
very [[great]] [[care]] and tenderness, and of five [[talents]] he had in estate, he
gave two and a half in [[marriage]] with an only [[daughter]] he had of his own,
and two and a half in [[marriage]] with the [[daughter]] of eudamidas, and on one
and the same day solemnised both their nuptials.

this [[example]] is very full, if one thing were not to be objected, namely
the multitude of [[friends]] for the [[perfect]] [[friendship]] i speak of is
indivisible; each one gives himself so entirely to his friend, that he
has nothing left to distribute to others: on the contrary, is [[sorry]] that
he is not double, treble, or quadruple, and that he has not many souls
and many wills, to confer them all upon this one object.  common
friendships will admit of division; one may [[love]] the [[beauty]] of this
person, the good-humour of that, the liberality of a third, the paternal
affection of a fourth, the fraternal [[love]] of a fifth, and so of the rest:
but this [[friendship]] that possesses the whole [[soul]], and there rules [[rule]] and
sways with an absolute sovereignty, cannot possibly admit of a rival.
if two at the same [[time]] should call to you for succour, to which of them
would you run?  should they require of you contrary offices, how could
you serve them both?  should one commit a thing to your [[silence]] that it
were of importance to the other to [[know]], how would you disengage
yourself?  a unique and particular [[friendship]] dissolves all other
obligations whatsoever: the secret i have sworn not to reveal to any
other, i may without perjury communicate to him who is not another, but
myself.  ‘tis miracle enough certainly, for a [[man]] to double himself, and
those that talk of tripling, talk they [[know]] not of what.  nothing is
extreme, that has its like; and he who shall suppose, that of two, i love
one as much as the other, that they mutually [[love]] one another too, and
love me as much as i [[love]] them, multiplies into a confraternity the most
single of units, and whereof, moreover, one alone is the hardest thing in
the [[world]] to find.  the rest of this story suits very well with what i
was saying; for eudamidas, as a bounty and favour, bequeaths to his
friends a legacy of employing themselves in his necessity; he leaves them
heirs to this liberality of his, which consists in giving them the
opportunity of conferring a benefit upon him; and doubtless, the [[force]] of
friendship is more eminently apparent in this act of his, than in that of
areteus.  in short, these are effects not to be imagined nor comprehended
by such as have not [[experience]] of them, and which make me infinitely
honour and [[admire]] the [[answer]] of that [[young]] soldier to cyrus, by whom
being [[asked]] how much he would take for a horse, with which he had won the
prize of a [[race]], and whether he would exchange him for a [[kingdom]]?
--“no, truly, sir,” said he, “but i would give him with all my [[heart]],
to get thereby a true friend, could i find out any [[man]] worthy of that
alliance.”--[xenophon, cyropadia, viii.  3.]--he did not say ill in
saying, “could i find”: for though one may almost everywhere meet with
men sufficiently qualified for a superficial acquaintance, yet in this,
where a [[man]] is to deal from the very bottom of his [[heart]], without any
manner of reservation, it will be requisite that all the wards and
springs be truly wrought and perfectly sure.

in confederations that hold but by one end, we are only to provide
against the imperfections that particularly concern that end.  it can be
of no importance to me of what [[religion]] my physician or my lawyer is;
this consideration has nothing in [[common]] with the offices of friendship
which they owe me; and i am of the same indifference in the domestic
acquaintance my servants must necessarily contract with me.  i never
inquire, when i am to take a footman, if he be chaste, but if he be
diligent; and am not solicitous if my muleteer be given to gaming, as if
he be [[strong]] and able; or if my cook be a swearer, if he be a [[good]] cook.
i do not take upon me to direct what other [[men]] should do in the
government of their families [[family]], there are plenty that meddle enough with
that, but only give an account of my method in my own:

          “mihi sic usus est: tibi, ut opus est facto, face.”

     [“this has been my way; as for you, do as you find needful.
     --“terence, heaut., i. i., 28.]

for table-talk, i prefer the pleasant and witty before the learned and
the grave; in bed, [[beauty]] before goodness; in [[common]] discourse the ablest
speaker, whether or no there be sincerity in the case.  and, as he that
was found astride upon a hobby-horse, playing with his [[children]],
entreated the [[person]] who had surprised him in that posture to say nothing
of it till himself came to be a [[father]],--[plutarch, [[life]] of agesilaus,
c.  9.]--supposing that the fondness that would then possess his own
soul, would render him a fairer [[judge]] of such an action; so i, also,
could [[wish]] to speak to such as have had [[experience]] of what i say: though,
knowing how remote a thing such a [[friendship]] is from the [[common]] practice,
and how rarely it is to be found, i despair of meeting with any such
judge.  for even these discourses left us by antiquity upon this [[subject]],
seem to me flat and [[poor]], in comparison of the sense i have of it, and in
this particular, the effects surpass even the precepts of [[philosophy]].

               “nil ego contulerim jucundo sanus amico.”

     [“while i have sense left to me, there will never be anything more
     acceptable to me than an agreeable friend.”
      --horace, sat., i. 5, 44.]

the ancient menander declared him to be [[happy]] that had had the good
fortune to meet with but the shadow of a friend: and doubtless he had
good [[reason]] to say so, especially if he spoke by [[experience]]: for in good
earnest, if i compare all the rest of my [[life]], though, thanks be to [[god]],
i have passed my [[time]] pleasantly enough, and at my ease, and the loss of
such a friend excepted, [[free]] from any grievous affliction, and in great
tranquillity of [[mind]], having been contented with my [[natural]] and original
commodities, without being solicitous after others; if i should compare
it all, i say, with the four years i had the [[happiness]] to enjoy the sweet
society of this excellent [[man]], ‘tis nothing but smoke, an obscure and
tedious night.  from the day that i lost him:

                              “quern semper acerbum,
               semper honoratum (sic, di, voluistis) habebo,”

     [“a day for me ever [[sad]], for ever [[sacred]], so have you willed ye
     gods.”--aeneid, v. 49.]

i have only [[led]] a languishing [[life]]; and the very pleasures [[pleasure]] that present
themselves to me, instead of administering anything of consolation,
double my affliction for his loss.  we were halves throughout, and to
that [[degree]], that methinks, by outliving him, i defraud him of his part.

              “nec fas esse ulla me voluptate hic frui
               decrevi, tantisper dum ille abest meus particeps.”

     [“i have determined that it will never be [[right]] for me to enjoy any
     [[pleasure]], so long as he, with whom i shared all pleasures [[pleasure]] is away.”
      --terence, heaut., i. i. 97.]

i was so grown and accustomed to be always his double in all places and
in all things, that methinks i am no more than half of myself:

              “illam meae si partem anima tulit
               maturior vis, quid moror altera?
                    nec carus aeque, nec superstes
                    integer?  ille dies utramque
               duxit ruinam.”

     [“if that half of my [[soul]] were snatch away from me by an untimely
     stroke, why should the other stay?  that which remains will not be
     equally dear, will not be whole: the same day will involve the
     destruction of both.”]

     or:

     [“if a superior [[force]] has taken that part of my [[soul]], why do i, the
     remaining one, linger behind?  what is left is not so dear, nor an
     entire thing: this day has wrought the destruction of both.”
      --horace, ode, ii. 17, 5.]

there is no action or [[imagination]] of mine wherein i do not miss him; as i
know that he would have missed me: for as he surpassed me by infinite
degrees in [[virtue]] and all other accomplishments, so he also did in the
duties of [[friendship]]:

              “quis desiderio sit pudor, aut modus
               tam cari capitis?”

     [“what shame can there, or measure, in lamenting so dear a friend?”
      --horace, ode, i. 24, i.]

              “o misero frater adempte mihi!
               omnia tecum una perierunt gaudia nostra,
               quae tuus in vita dulcis alebat amor.
               tu mea, tu moriens fregisti commoda, frater;
               tecum una tota est nostra sepulta anima
               cujus ego interitu tota de menthe fugavi
               haec studia, atque omnes delicias animi.
               alloquar?  audiero nunquam tua verba loquentem?
               nunquam ego te, vita frater amabilior
               aspiciam posthac; at certe semper amabo;”

     [“o [[brother]], taken from me miserable!  with thee, all our joys have
     vanished, those joys which, in thy [[life]], thy dear [[love]] nourished.
     dying, thou, my [[brother]], hast destroyed all my [[happiness]].  my whole
     [[soul]] is buried with thee.  through whose [[death]] i have [[banished]] from
     my [[mind]] these studies, and all the delights of the [[mind]].  shall i
     address thee?  i shall never hear thy voice.  never shall i behold
     thee hereafter.  o [[brother]], dearer to me than [[life]].  nought remains,
     but assuredly i shall ever [[love]] thee.”--catullus, lxviii.  20; lxv.]

but let us hear a boy of sixteen speak:

     --[in cotton’s translation the [[work]] referred to is “those memoirs
     upon the famous edict of january,” of which mention has already been
     made in the [[present]] edition.  the edition of 1580, however, and the
     variorum edition of 1872-1900, indicate no particular [[work]]; but the
     edition of 1580 has it “this boy of eighteen years” (which was the
     [[age]] at which la boetie wrote his “servitude volontaire”), speaks of
     “a boy of sixteen” as occurring only in the [[common]] editions, and it
     would seem tolerably clear that this more important [[work]] was, in
     [[fact]], the production to which montaigne refers, and that the proper
     reading of the text should be “sixteen years.”  what “this boy
     spoke” is not given by montaigne, for the [[reason]] stated in the next
     following paragraph.]

“because i have found that that [[work]] has been since brought out, and with
a mischievous design, by those who aim at disturbing and changing the
condition of our [[government]], without troubling themselves to think
whether they are likely to improve it: and because they have mixed up his
work with some of their own performance, i have refrained from inserting
it here.  but that the memory of the author may not be injured, nor
suffer with such as could not come near-hand to be acquainted with his
principles, i here give them to [[understand]], that it was written by him in
his boyhood, and that by way of exercise only, as a [[common]] theme that has
been hackneyed by a thousand writers.  i make no [[question]] but that he
himself believed what he wrote, being so conscientious that he would not
so much as [[lie]] in jest: and i moreover [[know]], that could it have been in
his own [[choice]], he had rather have been born at venice, than at sarlac;
and with [[reason]].  but he had another [[maxim]] sovereignty imprinted in his
soul, very religiously to obey and submit to the laws [[law]] under which he was
born.  there never was a [[better]] citizen, more affectionate to his
country; nor a greater [[enemy]] to all the commotions and innovations of his
time: so that he would much rather have employed his talent to the
extinguishing of those civil flames, than have added any fuel to them;
he had a [[mind]] fashioned to the model of [[better]] ages [[age]].  now, in exchange of
this serious piece, i will [[present]] you with another of a more [[gay]] and
frolic air, from the same hand, and written at the same [[age]].”




chapter xxviii.

nine and twenty sonnets of estienne de la boitie

to madame de grammont, comtesse de guissen.

     [they scarce contain anything but amorous complaints, expressed in a
     very rough style, discovering the follies and outrages of a restless
     passion, overgorged, as it were, with jealousies, fears [[fear]] and
     suspicions.--coste.]

     [these....contained in the edition of 1588 nine-and-twenty sonnets
     of la boetie, accompanied by a dedicatory epistle to madame de
     grammont.  the former, which are referred to at the end of chap.
     xxvil, do not really belong to the [[book]], and are of very slight
     interest at this [[time]]; the epistle is transferred to the
     correspondence.  the sonnets, with the letter, were presumably sent
     some [[time]] after letters v. et seq.  montaigne seems to have had
     several copies written out to forward to [[friends]] or acquaintances.]




chapter xxix.

of moderation

as if we had an infectious touch, we, by our manner of handling, corrupt
things that in themselves are laudable and [[good]]: we may grasp [[virtue]] so
that it becomes vicious, if we embrace it too stringently and with too
violent a [[desire]].  those who say, there is never any excess in [[virtue]],
forasmuch as it is not [[virtue]] when it once becomes excess, only play upon
words:

              “insani sapiens nomen ferat, aequus iniqui,
               ultra quam satis est, virtutem si petat ipsam.”

     [“let the [[wise]] [[man]] bear the name of a madman, the just one of an
     [[unjust]], if he seek [[wisdom]] more than is sufficient.”
      --horace, ep., i. 6, 15.]

     [“the [[wise]] [[man]] is no longer [[wise]], the just [[man]] no longer just, if he
     seek to carry his [[love]] for [[wisdom]] or [[virtue]] beyond that which is
     necessary.”]

this is a subtle consideration of [[philosophy]].  a [[man]] may both be too much
in [[love]] with [[virtue]], and be excessive in a just action.  holy writ agrees
with this, be not wiser than you should, but be soberly [[wise]].--[st.
paul, epistle to the romans, xii. 3.]--i have known a [[great]] [[man]],

     --[“it is likely that montaigne meant henry iii., [[king]] of [[france]].
     the cardinal d’ossat, writing to louise, the queen-dowager, told
     her, in his frank manner, that he had lived as much or more like a
     monk than a monarch (letter xxiii.) and [[pope]] sextus v., speaking of
     that [[prince]] one day to the cardinal de joyeuse, protector of the
     affairs of [[france]], said to him pleasantly, ‘there is nothing that
     your [[king]] hath not done, and does not do so still, to be a monk, nor
     anything that i have not done, not to be a monk.’”--coste.]

prejudice the [[opinion]] [[men]] had of his devotion, by pretending to be devout
beyond all examples [[example]] of others of his condition.  i [[love]] temperate and
moderate natures [[nature]].  an immoderate zeal, even to that which is [[good]], even
though it does not offend, astonishes me, and puts me to study what name
to give it.  neither the [[mother]] of pausanias,

     --[“montaigne would here give us to [[understand]], upon the [[authority]] of
     diodorus siculus, that pausanias’ [[mother]] gave the first hint of the
     [[punishment]] that was to be inflicted on her [[son]].  ‘pausanias,’ says
     this historian, ‘perceiving that the ephori, and some other
     lacedoemonians, aimed at apprehending him, got the start of them,
     and went and took sanctuary m minerva’s temple: and the
     lacedaemonians, being doubtful whether they ought to take him from
     thence in violation of the franchise there, it is said that his own
     [[mother]] came herself to the temple but spoke nothing nor did anything
     more than lay a piece of brick, which she brought with her, on the
     threshold of the temple, which, when she had done, she returned
     [[home]].  the lacedaemonians, taking the hint from the [[mother]], caused
     the gate of the temple to be walled up, and by this means starved
     pausanias, so that he died with [[hunger]], &c. (lib. xi. cap. 10., of
     amyot’s translation).  the name of pausanias’ [[mother]] was alcithea,
     as we are informed by thucydides’ scholiast, who only says that it
     was reported, that when they set about walling up the gates of the
     chapel in which pausanias had taken refuge, his [[mother]] alcithea laid
     the first stone.”--coste.]

who was the first instructor of her son’s process, and threw the first
stone towards his [[death]], nor posthumius the dictator, who put his [[son]] to
death, whom the ardour of [[youth]] had successfully pushed upon the [[enemy]] a
little more advanced than the rest of his squadron, do appear to me so
much just as [[strange]]; and i should neither advise nor like to [[follow]] so
savage a [[virtue]], and that costs so dear.

     --[“opinions differ as to the [[truth]] of this [[fact]].  livy thinks [[think]] he
     has [[good]] [[authority]] for rejecting it because it does not appear in
     [[history]] that posthumious was branded with it, as titus manlius was,
     about 100 years after his [[time]]; for manlius, having put his [[son]] to
     [[death]] for the like cause, obtained the odious name of imperiosus,
     and since that [[time]] manliana imperia has been used as a term to
     signify orders that are too severe; manliana imperia, says livy,
     were not only horrible for the [[time]] [[present]], but of a [[bad]] [[example]] to
     [[posterity]].  and this historian makes no [[doubt]] but such commands
     would have been actually styled posthumiana imperia, if posthumius
     had been the first who set so barbarous an [[example]] (livy, lib. iv.
     cap. 29, and lib. viii. cap. 7).  but, however, montaigne has valer.
     maximus on his side, who says expressly, that posthumius caused his
     [[son]] to be put to [[death]], and diodorus of sicily (lib.  xii.  cap.
     19).”--coste.]

the archer that shoots over, misses as much as he that falls short, and
‘tis equally troublesome to my sight, to look up at a [[great]] [[light]], and
to look down into a dark abyss.  callicles in [[plato]] says, that the
extremity of [[philosophy]] is hurtful, and advises not to dive into it
beyond the limits of [[profit]]; that, taken moderately, it is pleasant and
useful; but that in the end it renders a [[man]] brutish and vicious, a
contemner of [[religion]] and the [[common]] laws [[law]], an [[enemy]] to civil
conversation, and all [[human]] pleasures [[pleasure]], incapable of all public
administration, unfit either to assist others or to relieve himself, and
a fit object for all sorts of injuries and affronts.  he says true; for
in its excess, it enslaves our [[natural]] [[freedom]], and by an impertinent
subtlety, leads us out of the [[fair]] and beaten way that [[nature]] has traced
for us.

the [[love]] we bear to our wives [[wife]] is very lawful, and yet theology thinks [[think]] fit
to curb and restrain it.  as i [[remember]], i have [[read]] in one place of st.
thomas aquinas,--[secunda secundx, quaest. 154, art [[arts]]. 9.]--where he
condemns marriages [[marriage]] within any of the forbidden degrees [[degree]], for this [[reason]],
amongst others, that there is some danger, lest the [[friendship]] a man
bears to such a woman, should be immoderate; for if the conjugal
affection be full and [[perfect]] betwixt them, as it ought to be, and that
it be over and above surcharged with that of kindred too, there is no
doubt, but such an addition will carry the husband beyond the bounds of
reason.

those sciences [[science]] that regulate the manners of [[men]], divinity and [[philosophy]],
will have their say in everything; there is no action so private and
secret that can escape their inspection and jurisdiction.  they are best
taught who are [[best]] able to control and curb their own [[liberty]]; women
expose their nudities as much as you will upon the account of [[pleasure]],
though in the necessities of physic they are altogether as shy.  i will,
therefore, in their behalf:

     --[coste translates this: “on the part of [[philosophy]] and theology,”
      observing that but few wives [[wife]] would [[think]] themselves obliged to
     montaigne for any such lesson to their husbands.]--

teach the husbands, that is, such as are too vehement in the exercise of
the matrimonial duty--if such there still be--this lesson, that the very
pleasures they enjoy in the [[society]] of their wives [[wife]] are reproachable if
immoderate, and that a licentious and riotous [[abuse]] of them is a [[fault]] as
reprovable here as in illicit connections.  those immodest and debauched
tricks and postures, that the first ardour suggests to us in this affair,
are not only indecently but detrimentally practised upon our wives [[wife]].  let
them at least learn impudence from another hand; they are ever ready
enough for our [[business]], and i for my part always went the plain way to
work.

marriage is a solemn and [[religious]] tie, and therefore the [[pleasure]] we
extract from it should be a sober and serious delight, and mixed with a
certain [[kind]] of gravity; it should be a sort of discreet and
conscientious [[pleasure]].  and seeing that the [[chief]] end of it is
generation, some make a [[question]], whether when [[men]] are out of hopes [[hope]] as
when they are superannuated or already with child, it be lawful to
embrace our wives [[wife]].  ‘tis homicide, according to [[plato]].--[laws, 8.]--
certain nations (the mohammedan, amongst others) abominate all conjunction
with [[women]] with child, others also, with those who are in their courses.
zenobia would never admit her husband for more than one encounter, after
which she left him to his own swing for the whole [[time]] of her conception,
and not till after that would again receive him:--[trebellius pollio,
triginta tyran., c. 30.]--a brave and generous [[example]] of conjugal
continence.  it was doubtless from some lascivious poet,--[the lascivious
poet is [[homer]]; see his iliad, xiv.  294.]--and one that himself was in
great distress for a little of this [[sport]], that [[plato]] borrowed this
story; that [[jupiter]] was one day so hot upon his [[wife]], that not having so
much patience as till she could get to the couch, he threw her upon the
floor, where the vehemence of [[pleasure]] made him forget the [[great]] and
important resolutions he had but newly taken with the rest of the gods in
his celestial council, and to brag that he had had as [[good]] a bout, as
when he got her maidenhead, unknown to their parents.

the kings [[king]] of [[persia]] were wont to invite their wives [[wife]] to the beginning of
their festivals; but when the wine began to [[work]] in [[good]] earnest, and
that they were to give the reins to [[pleasure]], they sent them back to
their private apartments, that they might not participate in their
immoderate [[lust]], sending for other [[women]] in their stead, with whom they
were not obliged to so [[great]] a decorum of [[respect]].--[plutarch, precepts
of [[marriage]], c.  14.]--all pleasures [[pleasure]] and all sorts of gratifications
are not properly and fitly conferred upon all sorts of persons [[person]].
epaminondas had committed to prison a [[young]] [[man]] for [[certain]] debauches;
for whom pelopidas mediated, that at his request he might be set at
liberty, which epaminondas denied to him, but granted it at the first
word to a wench of his, that made the same intercession; saying, that it
was a gratification fit for such a one as she, but not for a captain.
sophocles being joint praetor with pericles, seeing accidentally a fine
boy pass by: “o what a charming boy is that!” said he.  “that might be
very well,” answered pericles, “for any other than a praetor, who ought
not only to have his hands, but his [[eyes]], too, chaste.”--[cicero, de
offic., i. 40.]  aelius verus, the [[emperor]], answered his [[wife]], who
reproached him with his [[love]] to other [[women]], that he did it upon a
conscientious account, forasmuch as [[marriage]] was a name of [[honour]] and
dignity, not of wanton and lascivious [[desire]]; and our ecclesiastical
history preserves the memory of that woman in [[great]] veneration, who
parted from her husband because she would not comply with his indecent
and inordinate desires [[desire]].  in fine, there is no [[pleasure]] so just and
lawful, where intemperance and excess are not to be condemned.

but, to speak the [[truth]], is not [[man]] a most miserable creature the while?
it is scarce, by his [[natural]] condition, in his [[power]] to taste one
pleasure pure and entire; and yet must he be contriving doctrines and
precepts to curtail that little he has; he is not yet wretched enough,
unless by art [[arts]] and study he augment his own misery:

               “fortunae miseras auximus arte vias.”

     [“we artificially augment the wretchedness of [[fortune]].”
      --properitius, lib. iii. 7, 44.]

human [[wisdom]] makes as ill use of her talent, when she exercises it in
rescinding from the number and sweetness of those pleasures [[pleasure]] that are
naturally our due, as she employs it favourably and well in artificially
disguising and tricking out the ills of [[life]], to alleviate the sense of
them.  had i ruled the roast, i should have taken another and more
natural course, which, to say the [[truth]], is both commodious and holy, and
should, peradventure, have been able to have limited it too;
notwithstanding that both our [[spiritual]] and corporal physicians, as by
compact betwixt themselves, can find no other way to cure, nor other
remedy for the infirmities of the [[body]] and the [[soul]], than by misery and
pain.  to this end, watchings, fastings, hair-shirts, remote and solitary
banishments, perpetual imprisonments, whips and other afflictions, have
been introduced amongst [[men]]: but so, that they should carry a sting with
them, and be real afflictions indeed; and not fall out as it once did to
one gallio, who having been sent an [[exile]] into the isle of lesbos, news
was not long after brought to [[rome]], that he there lived as merry as the
day was long; and that what had been enjoined him for a penance, turned
to his [[pleasure]] and satisfaction: whereupon the senate [[thought]] fit to
recall him [[home]] to his [[wife]] and [[family]], and confine him to his own house,
to accommodate their [[punishment]] to his feeling and apprehension.  for to
him whom fasting would make more healthful and more sprightly, and to him
to whose palate fish were more acceptable than flesh, the prescription of
these would have no curative effect; no more than in the other sort of
physic, where drugs have no effect upon him who swallows them with
appetite and [[pleasure]]: the bitterness of the potion and the abhorrence of
the patient are necessary circumstances to the operation.  the nature
that would [[eat]] rhubarb like buttered turnips, would frustrate the use and
virtue of it; it must be something to trouble and disturb the stomach,
that must purge and cure it; and here the [[common]] [[rule]], that things are
cured by their contraries, fails; for in this one ill is cured by
another.

this [[belief]] a little resembles that other so ancient one, of thinking to
gratify the gods and [[nature]] by massacre and murder: an opinion
universally once received in all religions [[religion]].  and still, in these later
times wherein our fathers [[father]] lived, amurath at the taking of the isthmus,
immolated six hundred [[young]] greeks [[greek]] to his father’s [[soul]], in the [[nature]] of
a propitiatory [[sacrifice]] for his sins [[sin]].  and in those new countries
discovered in this [[age]] of ours, which are pure and virgin yet, in
comparison of ours, this practice is in some measure everywhere received:
all their idols reek with [[human]] [[blood]], not without various examples [[example]] of
horrid [[cruelty]]: some they burn alive, and take, half broiled, off the
coals to tear out their hearts [[heart]] and entrails; some, even [[women]], they flay
alive, and with their bloody skins clothe and [[disguise]] others.  neither
are we without [[great]] examples [[example]] of constancy and resolution in this affair
the [[poor]] souls [[soul]] that are to be sacrificed, old [[men]], [[women]], and [[children]],
themselves going about some days before to beg alms for the offering of
their [[sacrifice]], presenting themselves to the slaughter, singing and
dancing with the spectators.

the ambassadors of the [[king]] of mexico, setting out to fernando cortez the
power and greatness of their master, after having told him, that he had
thirty vassals, of whom each was able to raise an hundred thousand
fighting [[men]], and that he kept his court in the fairest and best
fortified [[city]] under the sun, added at [[last]], that he was obliged yearly
to offer to the gods fifty thousand [[men]].  and it is affirmed, that he
maintained a continual [[war]], with some potent neighbouring nations, not
only to keep the [[young]] [[men]] in exercise, but principally to have
wherewithal to furnish his sacrifices [[sacrifice]] with his prisoners [[prisoner]] of [[war]].  at a
certain town in another place, for the welcome of the said cortez, they
sacrificed fifty [[men]] at once.  i will tell you this one tale more, and i
have done; some of these [[people]] being beaten by him, sent to acknowledge
him, and to treat with him of a [[peace]], whose messengers carried him three
sorts of gifts, which they presented in these terms: “behold, [[lord]], here
are five slaves [[slave]]: if thou art [[arts]] a furious [[god]] that feedeth upon flesh and
blood, [[eat]] these, and we will bring thee more; if thou art [[arts]] an affable
god, behold here incense and feathers; but if thou art [[arts]] a [[man]], take these
fowls and these fruits that we have brought thee.”




chapter xxx

of cannibals

when [[king]] pyrrhus invaded [[italy]], having viewed and considered the order
of the [[army]] the romans sent out to meet him; “i [[know]] not,” said he,
“what [[kind]] of barbarians” (for so the greeks [[greek]] called all other nations)
“these may be; but the disposition of this [[army]] that i see has nothing of
barbarism in it.”--[plutarch, [[life]] of pyrrhus, c. 8.]--as much said the
greeks of that which flaminius brought into their [[country]]; and philip,
beholding from an eminence the order and distribution of the roman camp
formed in his [[kingdom]] by publius sulpicius galba, spake to the same
effect.  by which it appears how cautious [[men]] ought to be of taking
things upon trust from vulgar [[opinion]], and that we are to [[judge]] by the
eye of [[reason]], and not from [[common]] report.

i long had a [[man]] in my house that lived ten or twelve years in the new
world, discovered in these latter days, and in that part of it where
villegaignon landed,--[at brazil, in 1557.]--which he called antarctic
france.  this discovery of so vast a [[country]] seems to be of very great
consideration.  i cannot be sure, that hereafter there may not be
another, so many wiser [[men]] than we having been deceived in this.  i am
afraid our [[eyes]] are bigger than our bellies, and that we have more
curiosity than capacity; for we grasp at all, but catch nothing but wind.

plato brings in solon,--[in timaeus.]--telling a story that he had
heard from the priests [[priest]] of sais in [[egypt]], that of old, and before the
deluge, there was a [[great]] island called atlantis, situate directly at the
mouth of the straits of gibraltar, which contained more countries [[country]] than
both [[africa]] and [[asia]] put together; and that the kings [[king]] of that [[country]],
who not only possessed that isle, but extended their dominion so far into
the continent that they had a [[country]] of [[africa]] as far as [[egypt]], and
extending in [[europe]] to tuscany, attempted to encroach even upon [[asia]], and
to subjugate all the nations that border upon the mediterranean sea, as
far as the black sea; and to that effect overran all [[spain]], the gauls,
and [[italy]], so far as to penetrate into greece, where the athenians
stopped them: but that some [[time]] after, both the athenians, and they and
their island, were swallowed by the flood.

it is very likely that this extreme irruption and inundation of water
made wonderful changes [[change]] and alterations in the habitations of the [[earth]],
as ‘tis said that the sea then divided sicily from italy--

         “haec loca, vi quondam et vasta convulsa ruina,
          dissiluisse ferunt, quum protenus utraque tellus
          una foret”

     [“these lands [[land]], they say, formerly with [[violence]] and vast desolation
     convulsed, burst asunder, where erewhile were.”--aeneid, iii. 414.]

cyprus from syria, the isle of negropont from the continent of beeotia,
and elsewhere [[united]] lands [[land]] that were separate before, by filling up the
channel betwixt them with sand and mud:

              “sterilisque diu palus, aptaque remis,
               vicinas urbes alit, et grave sentit aratrum.”

     [“that which was once a sterile marsh, and bore vessels on its
     bosom, now feeds neighbouring cities [[city]], and admits the plough.”
      --horace, de arte poetica, v. 65.]

but there is no [[great]] appearance that this isle was this new [[world]] so
lately discovered: for that almost touched upon [[spain]], and it were an
incredible effect of an inundation, to have tumbled back so prodigious a
mass, above twelve hundred leagues: besides that our [[modern]] navigators
have already almost discovered it to be no island, but terra firma, and
continent with the east indies on the one side, and with the lands [[land]] under
the two poles on the other side; or, if it be separate from them, it is
by so narrow a strait and channel, that it none the more deserves the
name of an island for that.

it should seem, that in this [[great]] [[body]], there are two sorts of motions,
the one [[natural]] and the other febrific, as there are in ours.  when i
consider the impression that our river of dordogne has made in my [[time]] on
the [[right]] bank of its descent, and that in twenty years it has gained so
much, and undermined the foundations of so many houses, i perceive it to
be an extraordinary agitation: for had it always followed this course,
or were hereafter to do it, the aspect of the [[world]] would be totally
changed.  but rivers alter their course, sometimes beating against the
one side, and sometimes the other, and some times [[time]] quietly keeping the
channel.  i do not speak of sudden inundations, the causes of which
everybody understands.  in medoc, by the seashore, the sieur d’arsac, my
brother, sees an estate he had there, buried under the sands which the
sea vomits before it: where the tops of some houses are yet to be seen,
and where his rents and domains are converted into pitiful barren
pasturage.  the inhabitants of this place affirm, that of late years the
sea has driven so vehemently upon them, that they have lost above four
leagues of [[land]].  these sands are her harbingers: and we now see great
heaps of moving sand, that march half a league before her, and occupy the
land.

the other testimony from antiquity, to which some would apply this
discovery of the new [[world]], is in [[aristotle]]; at least, if that little
book of unheard of [[miracles]] be his--[one of the spurious publications
brought out under his name--d.w.].  he there tells us, that certain
carthaginians, having crossed the atlantic sea without the straits of
gibraltar, and sailed a very long [[time]], discovered at [[last]] a [[great]] and
fruitful island, all covered over with wood, and watered with several
broad and deep rivers, far remote from all terra firma; and that they,
and others after them, allured by the goodness and fertility of the soil,
went thither with their wives [[wife]] and [[children]], and began to plant a colony.
but the senate of [[carthage]] perceiving their [[people]] by little and little
to diminish, issued out an express prohibition, that none, upon [[pain]] of
death, should transport themselves thither; and also drove out these new
inhabitants; fearing, ‘tis said, lest’ in process of [[time]] they should so
multiply as to supplant themselves and ruin their [[state]].  but this
relation of [[aristotle]] no more agrees with our new-found lands [[land]] than the
other.

this [[man]] that i had was a plain ignorant fellow, and therefore the more
likely to tell [[truth]]: for your better-bred sort of [[men]] are much more
curious in their observation, ‘tis true, and discover a [[great]] deal more;
but then they gloss upon it, and to give the greater weight to what they
deliver, and allure your [[belief]], they cannot forbear a little to alter
the story; they never represent things to you simply as they are, but
rather as they appeared to them, or as they would have them appear to
you, and to gain the [[reputation]] of [[men]] of [[judgment]], and the [[better]] to
induce your [[faith]], are willing to [[help]] out the [[business]] with something
more than is really true, of their own invention.  now in this case, we
should either have a [[man]] of irreproachable veracity, or so simple that he
has not wherewithal to contrive, and to give a colour of [[truth]] to false
relations, and who can have no ends in forging an untruth.  such a one
was mine; and besides, he has at divers times [[time]] brought to me several
seamen and merchants who at the same [[time]] went the same [[voyage]].  i shall
therefore content myself with his information, without inquiring what the
cosmographers say to the [[business]].  we should have topographers to trace
out to us the particular places where they have been; but for having had
this advantage over us, to have seen the holy [[land]], they would have the
privilege, forsooth, to tell us stories of all the other parts of the
world beside.  i would have every one write what he knows [[know]], and as much as
he knows [[know]], but no more; and that not in this only but in all other
subjects; for such a [[person]] may have some particular [[knowledge]] and
experience of the [[nature]] of such a river, or such a fountain, who, as to
other things, knows [[know]] no more than what everybody does, and yet to give a
currency to his little pittance of learning, will undertake to write the
whole [[body]] of physics: a [[vice]] from which [[great]] inconveniences derive
their original.

now, to return to my [[subject]], i find that there is nothing barbarous and
savage in this nation, by anything that i can gather, excepting, that
every one gives the title of barbarism to everything that is not in use
in his own [[country]].  as, indeed, we have no other level of [[truth]] and
reason than the [[example]] and [[idea]] of the opinions [[opinion]] and customs of the place
wherein we [[live]]: there is always the [[perfect]] [[religion]], there the perfect
government, there the most exact and accomplished usage of all things.
they are savages at the same rate that we say fruits are wild, which
nature produces [[produce]] of herself and by her own ordinary [[progress]]; whereas, in
truth, we ought rather to call those wild whose natures [[nature]] we have changed
by our artifice and diverted from the [[common]] order.  in those, the
genuine, most useful, and [[natural]] virtues [[virtue]] and properties [[property]] are vigorous and
sprightly, which we have helped to degenerate in these, by accommodating
them to the [[pleasure]] of our own corrupted palate.  and yet for all this,
our taste confesses a flavour and delicacy excellent even to emulation of
the [[best]] of ours, in several fruits wherein those countries [[country]] abound
without art [[arts]] or [[culture]].  neither is it reasonable that art [[arts]] should gain
the pre-eminence of our [[great]] and powerful [[mother]] [[nature]].  we have so
surcharged her with the additional ornaments and graces we have added to
the [[beauty]] and riches [[rich]] of her own works [[work]] by our inventions, that we have
almost smothered her; yet in other places, where she shines in her own
purity and proper lustre, she marvellously baffles and disgraces all our
vain and frivolous attempts:

              “et veniunt hederae sponte sua melius;
               surgit et in solis formosior arbutus antris;
               et volucres nulls dulcius arte canunt.”

     [“the ivy grows [[best]] spontaneously, the arbutus [[best]] in shady caves;
     and the wild notes of birds are sweeter than art [[arts]] can [[teach]].
     --“propertius, i. 2, 10.]

our utmost endeavours cannot arrive at so much as to imitate the nest of
the least of birds, its contexture, [[beauty]], and convenience: not so much
as the web of a [[poor]] spider.

all things, says [[plato]],--[laws, 10.]--are produced either by [[nature]], by
fortune, or by art [[arts]]; the [[greatest]] and most beautiful by the one or the
other of the former, the least and the most imperfect by the [[last]].

these nations then seem to me to be so far barbarous, as having received
but very little form and [[fashion]] from art [[arts]] and [[human]] invention, and
consequently to be not much remote from their original simplicity.  the
laws of [[nature]], however, govern them still, not as yet much vitiated with
any mixture of ours: but ‘tis in such purity, that i am sometimes
troubled we were not sooner acquainted with these [[people]], and that they
were not discovered in those [[better]] times [[time]], when there were [[men]] much more
able to [[judge]] of them than we are.  i am [[sorry]] that lycurgus and plato
had no [[knowledge]] of them; for to my apprehension, what we now see in
those nations, does not only surpass all the pictures with which the
poets have adorned the golden [[age]], and all their inventions in feigning a
happy [[state]] of [[man]], but, moreover, the fancy and even the [[wish]] and desire
of [[philosophy]] itself; so native and so pure a simplicity, as we by
experience see to be in them, could never enter into their [[imagination]],
nor could they ever [[believe]] that [[human]] [[society]] could have been maintained
with so little artifice and [[human]] patchwork.  i should tell [[plato]] that it
is a nation wherein there is no manner of traffic, no [[knowledge]] of
letters, no [[science]] of numbers, no name of magistrate or political
superiority; no use of service, riches [[rich]] or [[poverty]], no contracts, no
successions, no dividends, no properties [[property]], no employments, but those of
leisure, no [[respect]] of kindred, but [[common]], no clothing, no agriculture,
no metal, no use of corn or wine; the very words that signify lying,
treachery, dissimulation, avarice, envy, detraction, pardon, never heard
of.

     --[this is the famous passage which shakespeare, through florio’s
     version, 1603, or ed.  1613, p. 102, has employed in the “tempest,”
      ii. 1.]

how much would he find his imaginary [[republic]] short of his [[perfection]]?

                    “viri a diis recentes.”

          [“men fresh from the gods.”--seneca, ep., 90.]

               “hos natura modos primum dedit.”

          [“these were the manners first taught by [[nature]].”
           --virgil, georgics, ii. 20.]

as to the rest, they [[live]] in a [[country]] very pleasant and temperate, so
that, as my witnesses inform me, ‘tis rare to hear of a sick [[person]], and
they moreover assure me, that they never saw any of the natives, either
paralytic, bleareyed, toothless, or crooked with [[age]].  the situation of
their [[country]] is along the sea-shore, enclosed on the other side towards
the [[land]], with [[great]] and high mountains, having about a hundred leagues
in breadth between.  they have [[great]] store of fish and flesh, that have
no resemblance to those of ours: which they [[eat]] without any other
cookery, than plain boiling, roasting, and broiling.  the first that rode
a horse thither, though in several other voyages he had contracted an
acquaintance and familiarity with them, put them into so terrible a
fright, with his centaur appearance, that they killed him with their
arrows before they could come to discover who he was.  their buildings
are very long, and of capacity to hold two or three hundred [[people]], made
of the barks of tall trees, reared with one end upon the ground, and
leaning to and supporting one another at the top, like some of our barns,
of which the covering hangs down to the very ground, and serves for the
side walls. they have wood so hard, that they cut with it, and make their
swords of it, and their grills of it to broil their meat.  their beds are
of cotton, hung swinging from the roof, like our seamen’s hammocks, every
man his own, for the wives [[wife]] [[lie]] apart from their husbands.  they rise with
the sun, and so soon as they are up, [[eat]] for all day, for they have no
more meals but that; they do not then drink, as suidas reports of some
other [[people]] of the east that never drank at their meals; but drink very
often all day after, and sometimes to a rousing pitch.  their drink is
made of a [[certain]] root, and is of the colour of our claret, and they
never drink it but lukewarm.  it will not keep above two or three days;
it has a somewhat sharp, brisk taste, is nothing heady, but very
comfortable to the stomach; laxative to strangers, but a very pleasant
beverage to such as are accustomed to it.  they make use, instead of
bread, of a [[certain]] [[white]] compound, like coriander seeds; i have tasted
of it; the taste is sweet and a little flat.  the whole day is spent in
dancing.  their [[young]] [[men]] go a-hunting after wild beasts with bows and
arrows; one part of their [[women]] are employed in preparing their drink the
while, which is their [[chief]] employment.  one of their old [[men]], in the
morning before they fall to eating, preaches to the whole [[family]], walking
from the one end of the house to the other, and several times [[time]] repeating
the same sentence, till he has finished the round, for their houses are
at least a hundred yards long.  valour towards their enemies [[enemy]] and love
towards their wives [[wife]], are the two heads of his discourse, never failing in
the close, to put them in [[mind]], that ‘tis their wives [[wife]] who provide them
their drink warm and well seasoned.  the [[fashion]] of their beds, ropes,
swords, and of the wooden bracelets they tie about their wrists, when
they go to [[fight]], and of the [[great]] canes, bored hollow at one end, by the
sound of which they keep the cadence of their dances, are to be seen in
several places, and amongst others, at my house.  they shave all over,
and much more neatly than we, without other razor than one of wood or
stone.  they [[believe]] in the immortality of the [[soul]], and that those who
have merited well of the gods are lodged in that part of [[heaven]] where the
sun rises, and the accursed in the west.

they have i [[know]] not what [[kind]] of priests [[priest]] and prophets [[prophet]], who very rarely
present themselves to the [[people]], having their abode in the mountains.
at their arrival, there is a [[great]] feast, and solemn assembly of many
villages: each house, as i have described, makes a village, and they are
about a french league distant from one another.  this [[prophet]] declaims to
them in [[public]], exhorting them to [[virtue]] and their [[duty]]: but all their
ethics are comprised in these two articles, resolution in [[war]], and
affection to their wives [[wife]].  he also prophesies to them events to come, and
the issues they are to expect from their enterprises, and prompts them to
or diverts them from [[war]]: but let him look to’t; for if he fail in his
divination, and anything happen otherwise than he has foretold, he is cut
into a thousand pieces, if he be caught, and condemned for a false
prophet: for that [[reason]], if any of them has been mistaken, he is no more
heard of.

divination is a gift of [[god]], and therefore to [[abuse]] it, ought to be a
punishable imposture.  amongst the scythians, where their diviners failed
in the promised effect, they were laid, bound hand and foot, upon carts
loaded with firs and bavins, and drawn by oxen, on which they were burned
to [[death]].--[herodotus, iv.  69.]--such as only meddle with things
subject to the conduct of [[human]] capacity, are excusable in doing the best
they can: but those other fellows that come to delude us with assurances
of an extraordinary faculty, beyond our understanding, ought they not to
be punished, when they do not make [[good]] the effect of their promise, and
for the temerity of their imposture?

they have continual [[war]] with the nations that [[live]] further within the
mainland, beyond their mountains, to which they go naked, and without
other arms than their bows and wooden swords [[sword]], fashioned at one end like
the head of our javelins.  the obstinacy of their battles [[battle]] is wonderful,
and they never end without [[great]] effusion of [[blood]]: for as to running
away, they [[know]] not what it is.  every one for a trophy brings [[home]] the
head of an [[enemy]] he has killed, which he fixes over the door of his
house.  after having a long [[time]] treated their prisoners [[prisoner]] very well, and
given them all the regales they can [[think]] of, he to whom the prisoner
belongs, invites a [[great]] assembly of his [[friends]].  they being come, he
ties a rope to one of the arms of the [[prisoner]], of which, at a distance,
out of his reach, he holds the one end himself, and gives to the friend
he loves [[love]] [[best]] the other arm to hold after the same manner; which being.
done, they two, in the presence of all the assembly, despatch him with
their swords [[sword]].  after that, they roast him, [[eat]] him amongst them, and send
some chops to their absent [[friends]].  they do not do this, as some [[think]],
for nourishment, as the scythians anciently did, but as a representation
of an extreme [[revenge]]; as will appear by this: that having observed the
portuguese, who were in league with their enemies [[enemy]], to inflict another
sort of [[death]] upon any of them they took prisoners [[prisoner]], which was to set them
up to the girdle in the [[earth]], to shoot at the remaining part till it was
stuck full of arrows, and then to hang them, they [[thought]] those [[people]] of
the other [[world]] (as being [[men]] who had sown the [[knowledge]] of a [[great]] many
vices amongst their neighbours, and who were much greater masters in all
sorts of mischief than they) did not exercise this sort of revenge
without a meaning, and that it must needs be more painful than theirs,
they began to leave their old way, and to [[follow]] this.  i am not sorry
that we should here take notice of the barbarous [[horror]] of so cruel an
action, but that, seeing so clearly into their faults [[fault]], we should be so
blind to our own.  i conceive there is more barbarity in eating a man
alive, than when he is [[dead]]; in tearing a [[body]] limb from limb by racks
and torments, that is yet in [[perfect]] sense; in roasting it by degrees [[degree]]; in
causing it to be bitten and worried by dogs and swine (as we have not
only [[read]], but lately seen, not amongst inveterate and mortal enemies [[enemy]],
but among neighbours and fellow-citizens, and, which is worse, under
colour of piety and religion), than to roast and [[eat]] him after he is
dead.

chrysippus and zeno, the two heads of the stoic sect, were of opinion
that there was no hurt in making use of our [[dead]] carcasses, in what way
soever for our necessity, and in feeding upon them too;--[diogenes
laertius, vii.  188.]--as our own [[ancestors]], who being besieged by
caesar in the [[city]] alexia, resolved to sustain the famine of the siege
with the bodies [[body]] of their old [[men]], [[women]], and other persons [[person]] who were
incapable of bearing arms.

              “vascones, ut fama est, alimentis talibus usi
               produxere animas.”

     [“‘tis said the gascons with such meats appeased their [[hunger]].”
      --juvenal, sat., xv. 93.]

and the physicians make no bones of employing it to all sorts of use,
either to apply it outwardly; or to give it inwardly for the health of
the patient.  but there never was any [[opinion]] so irregular, as to excuse
treachery, disloyalty, [[tyranny]], and [[cruelty]], which are our familiar
vices.  we may then call these [[people]] barbarous, in [[respect]] to the rules
of [[reason]]: but not in [[respect]] to ourselves, who in all sorts of barbarity
exceed them.  their wars [[war]] are throughout [[noble]] and generous, and carry as
much excuse and [[fair]] pretence, as that [[human]] malady is capable of; having
with them no other foundation than the sole [[jealousy]] of valour.  their
disputes are not for the [[conquest]] of new lands [[land]], for these they already
possess are so fruitful by [[nature]], as to supply them without [[labour]] or
concern, with all things necessary, in such abundance that they have no
need to enlarge their borders.  and they are, moreover, [[happy]] in this,
that they only covet so much as their [[natural]] necessities require: all
beyond that is superfluous to them: [[men]] of the same [[age]] call one another
generally brothers [[brother]], those who are younger, [[children]]; and the old [[men]] are
fathers to all.  these leave to their heirs in [[common]] the full possession
of goods [[good]], without any manner of division, or other title than what nature
bestows upon her creatures, in bringing them into the [[world]].  if their
neighbours pass over the mountains to assault them, and obtain a [[victory]],
all the victors gain by it is [[glory]] only, and the advantage of having
proved themselves the [[better]] in valour and [[virtue]]: for they never meddle
with the goods [[good]] of the conquered, but presently return into their own
country, where they have no want of anything necessary, nor of this
greatest of all goods [[good]], to [[know]] happily how to enjoy their condition and
to be content.  and those in turn do the same; they demand of their
prisoners no other ransom, than acknowledgment that they are overcome:
but there is not one found in an [[age]], who will not rather choose to die
than make such a [[confession]], or either by word or look recede from the
entire grandeur of an invincible [[courage]].  there is not a [[man]] amongst
them who had not rather be killed and eaten, than so much as to open his
mouth to entreat he may not.  they use them with all liberality and
freedom, to the end their lives [[life]] may be so much the dearer to them; but
frequently entertain them with menaces of their approaching [[death]], of the
torments they are to suffer, of the preparations making in order to it,
of the mangling their limbs, and of the feast that is to be made, where
their carcass is to be the only dish.  all which they do, to no other
end, but only to extort some gentle or submissive word from them, or to
frighten them so as to make them run away, to obtain this advantage that
they were terrified, and that their constancy was shaken; and indeed, if
rightly taken, it is in this point only that a true [[victory]] consists:

                              “victoria nulla est,
          quam quae confessor animo quoque subjugat hostes.”

     [“no [[victory]] is complete, which the conquered do not admit to be
     so.--“claudius, de sexto consulatu honorii, v. 248.]

the hungarians, a very warlike [[people]], never pretend further than to
reduce the [[enemy]] to their discretion; for having forced this confession
from them, they let them go without injury or ransom, excepting, at the
most, to make them engage their word never to bear arms against them
again.  we have sufficient advantages over our enemies [[enemy]] that are borrowed
and not truly our own; it is the quality of a porter, and no effect of
virtue, to have stronger arms and legs; it is a [[dead]] and corporeal
quality to set in array; ‘tis a turn of [[fortune]] to make our enemy
stumble, or to dazzle him with the [[light]] of the sun; ‘tis a trick of
science and art [[arts]], and that may happen in a mean base fellow, to be a good
fencer.  the estimate and value of a [[man]] consist in the [[heart]] and in the
will: there his true [[honour]] lies [[lie]].  valour is stability, not of legs and
arms, but of the [[courage]] and the [[soul]]; it does not [[lie]] in the goodness of
our horse or our arms but in our own.  he that falls obstinate in his
courage--

                    “si succiderit, de genu pugnat”

          [“if his legs fail him, he fights on his knees.”
           --seneca, de providentia, c. 2.]

--he who, for any danger of imminent [[death]], abates nothing of his
assurance; who, dying, yet darts at his [[enemy]] a fierce and disdainful
look, is overcome not by us, but by [[fortune]]; he is killed, not conquered;
the most valiant are sometimes the most unfortunate.  there are defeats
more triumphant than victories [[victory]].  never could those four sister victories [[victory]],
the fairest the sun ever be held, of salamis, plataea, mycale, and
sicily, venture to oppose all their [[united]] glories, to the [[single]] glory
of the discomfiture of [[king]] leonidas and his [[men]], at the pass of
thermopylae.  who ever ran with a more glorious [[desire]] and greater
ambition, to the winning, than captain iscolas to the [[certain]] loss of a
battle?--[diodorus siculus, xv.  64.]--who could have found out a more
subtle invention to secure his safety, than he did to assure his
destruction?  he was set to defend a [[certain]] pass of peloponnesus against
the arcadians, which, considering the [[nature]] of the place and the
inequality of forces [[force]], finding it utterly impossible for him to do, and
seeing that all who were presented to the [[enemy]], must certainly be left
upon the place; and on the other side, reputing it unworthy of his own
virtue and magnanimity and of the lacedaemonian name to fail in any part
of his [[duty]], he chose a mean betwixt these two extremes after this
manner; the youngest and most active of his [[men]], he preserved for the
service and defence of their [[country]], and sent them back; and with the
rest, whose loss would be of less consideration, he resolved to make good
the pass, and with the [[death]] of them, to make the [[enemy]] buy their entry
as dear as possibly he could; as it fell out, for being presently
environed on all sides by the arcadians, after having made a great
slaughter of the [[enemy]], he and his were all cut in pieces.  is there any
trophy dedicated to the conquerors which was not much more due to these
who were overcome?  the part that true conquering is to play, lies [[lie]] in the
encounter, not in the coming off; and the [[honour]] of valour consists in
fighting, not in subduing.

but to return to my story: these prisoners [[prisoner]] are so far from discovering
the least weakness, for all the terrors that can be represented to them,
that, on the contrary, during the two or three months they are kept, they
always appear with a cheerful countenance; importune their masters to
make haste to bring them to the test, defy, rail at them, and reproach
them with cowardice, and the number of battles [[battle]] they have lost against
those of their [[country]].  i have a [[song]] made by one of these prisoners [[prisoner]],
wherein he bids them “come all, and dine upon him, and welcome, for they
shall withal [[eat]] their own fathers [[father]] and grandfathers, whose flesh has
served to feed and nourish him.  these muscles,” says he, “this flesh and
these veins, are your own: [[poor]] silly souls [[soul]] as you are, you little think
that the substance of your ancestors’ limbs is here yet; notice what you
eat, and you will find in it the taste of your own flesh:” in which song
there is to be observed an invention that nothing relishes of the
barbarian.  those that paint these [[people]] dying after this manner,
represent the [[prisoner]] spitting in the faces of his executioners and
making wry mouths at them.  and ‘tis most [[certain]], that to the very last
gasp, they never cease to brave and defy them both in word and gesture.
in plain [[truth]], these [[men]] are very savage in comparison of us; of
necessity, they must either be absolutely so or else we are savages; for
there is a vast difference betwixt their manners and ours.

the [[men]] there have several wives [[wife]], and so much the greater number, by how
much they have the greater [[reputation]] for valour.  and it is one very
remarkable feature in their marriages [[marriage]], that the same [[jealousy]] our wives
have to hinder and divert us from the [[friendship]] and familiarity of other
women, those employ to promote their husbands’ desires [[desire]], and to procure
them many spouses; for being above all things solicitous of their
husbands’ [[honour]], ‘tis their chiefest [[care]] to seek out, and to bring in
the most companions they can, forasmuch as it is a testimony of the
husband’s [[virtue]].  most of our ladies [[lady]] will cry out, that ‘tis monstrous;
whereas in [[truth]] it is not so, but a truly matrimonial [[virtue]], and of the
highest form.  in the bible, sarah, with leah and rachel, the two wives
of jacob, gave the most beautiful of their handmaids to their husbands;
livia preferred the [[passions]] of augustus to her own interest;
--[suetonius, [[life]] of augustus, c. 71.]--and the [[wife]] of [[king]] deiotarus,
stratonice, did not only give up a [[fair]] [[young]] maid that served her to her
husband’s embraces, but moreover carefully brought up the [[children]] he had
by her, and assisted them in the succession to their father’s [[crown]].

and that it may not be supposed, that all this is done by a simple and
servile obligation to their [[common]] practice, or by any authoritative
impression of their ancient custom, without [[judgment]] or reasoning, and
from having a [[soul]] so stupid that it cannot contrive what else to do, i
must here give you some touches of their sufficiency in point of
understanding.  besides what i repeated to you before, which was one of
their songs [[song]] of [[war]], i have another, a love-song, that begins thus:

     “stay, adder, stay, that by thy pattern my sister may draw the
     [[fashion]] and [[work]] of a [[rich]] ribbon, that i may [[present]] to my beloved,
     by which means thy [[beauty]] and the excellent order of thy scales
     shall for ever be preferred before all other serpents.”

wherein the first couplet, “stay, adder,” &c., makes the burden of the
song.  now i have conversed enough with poetry to [[judge]] thus much that
not only there is nothing barbarous in this invention, but, moreover,
that it is perfectly anacreontic.  to which it may be added, that their
language is soft, of a pleasing accent, and something bordering upon the
greek termination.

three of these [[people]], not foreseeing how dear their [[knowledge]] of the
corruptions of this part of the [[world]] will one day cost their happiness
and repose, and that the effect of this commerce will be their ruin, as i
presuppose it is in a very [[fair]] way (miserable [[men]] to suffer themselves
to be deluded with [[desire]] of novelty and to have left the serenity of
their own [[heaven]] to come so far to gaze at ours!), were at rouen at the
time that the late [[king]] charles ix. was there.  the [[king]] himself talked
to them a [[good]] while, and they were made to see our fashions, our pomp,
and the form of a [[great]] [[city]].  after which, some one [[asked]] their [[opinion]],
and would [[know]] of them, what of all the things they had seen, they found
most to be admired?  to which they made [[answer]], three things, of which i
have forgotten the third, and am troubled at it, but two i yet [[remember]].
they said, that in the first place they [[thought]] it very [[strange]] that so
many tall [[men]], wearing beards, [[strong]], and well armed, who were about the
king (‘tis like they meant the swiss of the guard), should submit to obey
a child, and that they did not rather choose out one amongst themselves
to command.  secondly (they have a way of speaking in their [[language]] to
call [[men]] the half of one another), that they had observed that there were
amongst us [[men]] full and crammed with all manner of commodities, whilst,
in the meantime, their halves were begging at their doors, lean and
half-starved with [[hunger]] and [[poverty]]; and they [[thought]] it [[strange]] that
these necessitous halves were able to suffer so [[great]] an inequality and
injustice, and that they did not take the others by the throats, or set
fire to their houses.

i talked to one of them a [[great]] while together, but i had so ill an
interpreter, and one who was so perplexed by his own ignorance to
apprehend my meaning, that i could get nothing out of him of any moment:
asking him what advantage he reaped from the superiority he had amongst
his own [[people]] (for he was a captain, and our mariners called him king),
he told me, to march at the head of them to [[war]].  demanding of him
further how many [[men]] he had to [[follow]] him, he showed me a space of
ground, to signify as many as could march in such a compass, which might
be four or five thousand [[men]]; and putting the [[question]] to him whether or
no his [[authority]] expired with the [[war]], he told me this remained: that
when he went to visit the villages of his dependence, they planed him
paths through the thick of their woods, by which he might pass at his
ease.  all this does not sound very ill, and the [[last]] was not at all
amiss, for they wear no breeches.




chapter xxxi

that a [[man]] is soberly to [[judge]] of the [[divine]] ordinances

the true field and [[subject]] of imposture are things unknown, forasmuch as,
in the first place, their very strangeness lends them credit, and
moreover, by not being subjected to our ordinary reasons [[reason]], they deprive us
of the means to [[question]] and dispute them: for which [[reason]], says [[plato]],
--[in critias.]--it is much more easy to satisfy the hearers, when
speaking of the [[nature]] of the gods than of the [[nature]] of [[men]], because the
ignorance of the auditory affords a [[fair]] and large [[career]] and all manner
of [[liberty]] in the handling of abstruse things.  thence it comes to pass,
that nothing is so firmly believed, as what we least [[know]]; nor any people
so confident, as those who entertain us with fables, such as your
alchemists, judicial astrologers, fortune-tellers, and physicians,

                         “id genus omne.”

          [“all that sort of [[people]].”--horace, sat., i. 2, 2.]

to which i would willingly, if i durst, join a pack of [[people]] that take
upon them to interpret and control the designs of [[god]] himself, pretending
to find out the cause of every accident, and to pry into the secrets of
the [[divine]] will, there to discover the incomprehensible motive, of his
works; and although the variety, and the continual discordance of events,
throw them from corner to corner, and toss them from east to west, yet do
they still persist in their [[vain]] inquisition, and with the same pencil to
paint black and [[white]].

in a nation of the indies, there is this commendable custom, that when
anything befalls them amiss in any encounter or [[battle]], they publicly ask
pardon of the sun, who is their [[god]], as having committed an unjust
action, always imputing their [[good]] or [[evil]] [[fortune]] to the [[divine]] [[justice]],
and to that submitting their own [[judgment]] and [[reason]].  ‘tis enough for a
christian to [[believe]] that all things come from [[god]], to receive them with
acknowledgment of his [[divine]] and inscrutable [[wisdom]], and also thankfully
to accept and receive them, with what face soever they may present
themselves.  but i do not approve of what i see in use, that is, to seek
to affirm and support our [[religion]] by the [[prosperity]] of our enterprises.
our [[belief]] has other foundation enough, without going about to authorise
it by events: for the [[people]] being accustomed to such plausible arguments
as these and so proper to their taste, it is to be feared, lest when they
fail of [[success]] they should also stagger in their [[faith]]: as in the war
wherein we are now engaged upon the account of [[religion]], those who had
the [[better]] in the [[business]] of rochelabeille,--[may 1569.]--making great
brags of that [[success]] as an infallible approbation of their cause, when
they came afterwards to excuse their misfortunes of moncontour and
jarnac, by saying they were fatherly scourges and corrections that they
had not a [[people]] wholly at their [[mercy]], they make it manifestly enough
appear, what it is to take two sorts of grist out of the same sack, and
with the same mouth to blow hot and cold.  it were [[better]] to possess the
vulgar with the solid and real foundations of [[truth]].  ‘twas a fine naval
battle that was gained under the command of don john of austria a few
months since--[that of lepanto, october 7, 1571.]--against the turks;
but it has also pleased [[god]] at other times [[time]] to let us see as great
victories at our own expense.  in fine, ‘tis a hard matter to reduce
divine things to our balance, without waste and losing a [[great]] deal of
the weight.  and who would take upon him to give a [[reason]] that arius and
his [[pope]] leo, the principal heads of the arian heresy, should [[die]], at
several times [[time]], of so like and [[strange]] deaths [[death]] (for being withdrawn from
the disputation by a griping in the bowels, they both of them suddenly
gave up the ghost upon the stool), and would aggravate this divine
vengeance by the circumstances of the place, might as well add the death
of heliogabalus, who was also slain in a house of office.  and, indeed,
irenaeus was involved in the same [[fortune]].  [[god]], being pleased to show
us, that the [[good]] have something else to [[hope]] for and the wicked
something else to [[fear]], than the fortunes [[fortune]] or misfortunes of this [[world]],
manages and applies these according to his own occult will and [[pleasure]],
and deprives us of the means foolishly to make thereof our own [[profit]].
and those [[people]] [[abuse]] themselves who will pretend to dive into these
mysteries by the [[strength]] of [[human]] [[reason]].  they never give one hit that
they do not receive two for it; of which st. augustine makes out a great
proof upon his adversaries.  ‘tis a conflict that is more decided by
strength of memory than by the [[force]] of [[reason]].  we are to content
ourselves with the [[light]] it pleases the sun to communicate to us, by
virtue of his rays; and who will lift up his [[eyes]] to take in a greater,
let him not [[think]] it [[strange]], if for the [[reward]] of his presumption, he
there lose his sight.

               “quis hominum potest scire consilium dei?
               aut quis poterit cogitare quid velit dominus?”

     [“who of [[men]] can [[know]] the counsel of [[god]]? or who can [[think]] what the
     will of the [[lord]] is.”--book of [[wisdom]], ix. 13.]




chapter xxxii

that we are to avoid pleasures [[pleasure]], even at the expense of life

i had long ago observed most of the opinions [[opinion]] of the ancients to concur in
this, that it is high [[time]] to [[die]] when there is more ill than [[good]] in
living, and that to preserve [[life]] to our own torment and inconvenience is
contrary to the very rules [[rule]] of [[nature]], as these old laws [[law]] instruct us.

     [“either tranquil [[life]], or [[happy]] [[death]].  it is well to [[die]] when life
     is wearisome.  it is [[better]] to [[die]] than to [[live]] miserable.”
      --stobaeus, serm. xx.]

but to push this contempt of [[death]] so far as to employ it to the removing
our thoughts [[thought]] from the honours [[honour]], riches [[rich]], dignities, and other favours and
goods, as we call them, of [[fortune]], as if [[reason]] were not sufficient to
persuade us to avoid them, without adding this new injunction, i had
never seen it either commanded or practised, till this passage of seneca
fell into my hands; who advising lucilius, a [[man]] of [[great]] [[power]] and
authority about the [[emperor]], to alter his voluptuous and magnificent way
of living, and to retire himself from this worldly vanity and [[ambition]],
to some solitary, quiet, and philosophical [[life]], and the other alleging
some difficulties: “i am of [[opinion]],” says he, “either that thou leave
that [[life]] of thine, or [[life]] itself; i would, indeed, advise thee to the
gentle way, and to untie, rather than to break, the knot thou hast
indiscreetly knit, provided, that if it be not otherwise to be untied,
thou resolutely break it.  there is no [[man]] so [[great]] a [[coward]], that had
not rather once fall than to be always falling.”  i should have found
this counsel conformable enough to the stoical roughness: but it appears
the more [[strange]], for being borrowed from epicurus, who writes the same
thing upon the like [[occasion]] to idomeneus.  and i [[think]] i have observed
something like it, but with [[christian]] moderation, amongst our own [[people]].

st. hilary, bishop of poictiers, that famous [[enemy]] of the arian heresy,
being in syria, had [[intelligence]] thither sent him, that abra, his only
daughter, whom he left at [[home]] under the eye and tuition of her [[mother]],
was sought in [[marriage]] by the [[greatest]] noblemen of the [[country]], as being
a virgin virtuously brought up, [[fair]], [[rich]], and in the flower of her [[age]];
whereupon he wrote to her (as appears upon record), that she should
remove her affection from all the pleasures [[pleasure]] and advantages proposed to
her; for that he had in his travels found out a much greater and more
worthy [[fortune]] for her, a husband of much greater [[power]] and magnificence,
who would [[present]] her with robes and jewels of inestimable value; wherein
his design was to dispossess her of the appetite and use of worldly
delights, to join her wholly to [[god]]; but the nearest and most [[certain]] way
to this, being, as he conceived, the [[death]] of his [[daughter]]; he never
ceased, by vows, prayers, and orisons, to beg of the almighty, that he
would please to call her out of this [[world]], and to take her to himself;
as accordingly it came to pass; for soon after his return, she died, at
which he expressed a singular joy.  this seems to outdo the other,
forasmuch as he applies himself to this means at the outset, which they
only take subsidiarily; and, besides, it was towards his only [[daughter]].
but i will not omit the latter end of this story, though it be for my
purpose; st. hilary’s [[wife]], having understood from him how the [[death]] of
their [[daughter]] was brought about by his [[desire]] and design, and how much
happier she was to be removed out of this [[world]] than to have stayed in
it, conceived so vivid an apprehension of the eternal and heavenly
beatitude, that she begged of her husband, with the extremest
importunity, to do as much for her; and [[god]], at their joint request,
shortly after calling her to him, it was a [[death]] embraced with singular
and mutual content.




chapter xxxiii

that [[fortune]] is oftentimes observed to act by the [[rule]] of reason

the inconstancy and various motions of fortune

     [the term [[fortune]], so often employed by montaigne, and in passages
     where he might have used providence, was censured by the doctors who
     examined his essays when he was at [[rome]] in 1581.  see his travels,
     i. 35 and 76.]

may reasonably make us expect she should [[present]] us with all sorts of
faces.  can there be a more express act of [[justice]] than this?  the duc de
valentinois,--[caesar borgia.]--having resolved to poison adrian,
cardinal of corneto, with whom [[pope]] alexander vi., his [[father]] and
himself, were to sup in the vatican, he sent before a bottle of poisoned
wine, and withal, strict order to the butler to keep it very safe.
the [[pope]] being come before his [[son]], and calling for drink, the butler
supposing this wine had not been so strictly recommended to his [[care]],
but only upon the account of its excellency, presented it forthwith to
the [[pope]], and the duke himself coming in presently after, and being
confident they had not meddled with his bottle, took also his cup; so
that the [[father]] died immediately upon the spot--[other historians assign
the [[pope]] several days of misery prior to [[death]].  d.w.]--, and the [[son]],
after having been long tormented with sickness, was reserved to another
and a worse [[fortune]].

sometimes she seems to play upon us, just in the nick of an affair;
monsieur d’estrees, at that [[time]] ensign to monsieur de vendome, and
monsieur de licques, lieutenant in the company of the duc d’ascot, being
both pretenders to the sieur de fougueselles’ sister, though of several
parties (as it oft falls out amongst frontier neighbours), the sieur de
licques carried her; but on the same day he was [[married]], and which was
worse, before he went to bed to his [[wife]], the bridegroom having a [[mind]] to
break a lance in [[honour]] of his new bride, went out to skirmish near st.
omer, where the sieur d’estrees proving the stronger, took him [[prisoner]],
and the more to illustrate his [[victory]], the [[lady]] was fain--

              “conjugis ante coacta novi dimittere collum,
               quam veniens una atque altera rursus hyems
               noctibus in longis avidum saturasset amorem,”

     [“compelled to abstain from embracing her new spouse in her arms
     before two winters pass in succession, during their long nights had
     satiated her eager [[love]].”--catullus, lxviii.  81.]

--to request him of courtesy, to deliver up his [[prisoner]] to her, as he
accordingly did, the gentlemen of [[france]] never denying anything to
ladies.

does she not seem to be an artist here?  constantine, [[son]] of helena,
founded the [[empire]] of constantinople, and so many ages [[age]] after,
constantine, the [[son]] of helen, put an end to it.  sometimes she is
pleased to emulate our [[miracles]] we are told, that [[king]] clovis besieging
angouleme, the walls fell down of themselves by [[divine]] favour and bouchet
has it from some author, that [[king]] robert having sat down before a [[city]],
and being stolen away from the siege to go keep the feast of st. aignan
at orleans, as he was in devotion at a [[certain]] part of the mass, the
walls of the beleaguered [[city]], without any manner of [[violence]], fell down
with a sudden ruin.  but she did quite contrary in our milan wars [[war]]; for,
le capitaine rense laying siege for us to the [[city]] arona, and having
carried a mine under a [[great]] part of the wall, the mine being sprung, the
wall was lifted from its base, but dropped down again nevertheless, whole
and entire, and so exactly upon its foundation, that the besieged
suffered no inconvenience by that attempt.

sometimes she plays the physician.  jason of pheres being given over by
the physicians, by [[reason]] of an imposthume in his breast, having a mind
to rid himself of his [[pain]], by [[death]] at least, threw himself in a battle
desperately into the thickest of the [[enemy]], where he was so fortunately
wounded quite through the [[body]], that the imposthume broke, and he was
perfectly cured.  did she not also excel the painter protogenes in his
art? who having finished the picture of a dog quite tired and out of
breath, in all the other parts excellently well to his own liking, but
not being able to express, as he would, the slaver and foam that should
come out of its mouth, vexed and angry at his [[work]], he took his sponge,
which by cleaning his pencils had imbibed several sorts of colours, and
threw it in a rage against the picture, with an intent utterly to deface
it; when [[fortune]] guiding the sponge to hit just upon the mouth of the
dog, it there performed what all his art [[arts]] was not able to do.  does she
not sometimes direct our counsels and [[correct]] them?  isabel, queen of
england, having to sail from zealand into her own [[kingdom]],--[in 1326]--
with an [[army]], in favour of her [[son]] against her husband, had been lost,
had she come into the port she intended, being there laid wait for by the
enemy; but [[fortune]], against her will, threw her into another haven, where
she landed in safety.  and that [[man]] of old who, throwing a stone at a
dog, hit and killed his mother-in-law, had he not [[reason]] to pronounce
this verse:

          [“fortune has more judgement than we.”--menander]

icetes had contracted with two soldiers to kill timoleon at adrana in
sicily.--[plutarch, [[life]] of timoleon, c. 7.]--they took their [[time]] to do
it when he was assisting at a [[sacrifice]], and thrusting into the crowd,
as they were making signs to one another, that now was a fit [[time]] to do
their [[business]], in steps a third, who, with a [[sword]] takes one of them
full drive over the pate, lays him [[dead]] upon the place and runs away,
which the others see, and concluding himself discovered and lost, runs to
the altar and begs for [[mercy]], promising to discover the whole [[truth]],
which as he was doing, and laying open the full conspiracy, behold the
third [[man]], who being apprehended, was, as a murderer, thrust and hauled
by the [[people]] through the press, towards timoleon, and the other most
eminent persons [[person]] of the assembly, before whom being brought, he cries out
for pardon, pleading that he had justly slain his father’s murderer;
which he, also, proving upon the spot, by sufficient witnesses, whom his
good [[fortune]] very opportunely supplied him withal, that his [[father]] was
really killed in the [[city]] of leontini, by that very [[man]] on whom he had
taken his [[revenge]], he was presently awarded ten attic minae, for having
had the [[good]] [[fortune]], by designing to [[revenge]] the [[death]] of his [[father]],
to preserve the [[life]] of the [[common]] [[father]] of sicily.  [[fortune]], truly, in
her conduct surpasses all the rules [[rule]] of [[human]] prudence.

but to conclude: is there not a direct application of her favour, bounty,
and piety manifestly discovered in this action?  ignatius the [[father]] and
ignatius the [[son]] being proscribed by the triumvirs of [[rome]], resolved upon
this generous act of mutual [[kindness]], to fall by the hands of one
another, and by that means to frustrate and defeat the [[cruelty]] of the
tyrants; and accordingly with their swords [[sword]] drawn, ran full drive upon one
another, where [[fortune]] so guided the points, that they made two equally
mortal wounds, affording withal so much [[honour]] to so brave a [[friendship]],
as to leave them just [[strength]] enough to draw out their bloody swords [[sword]],
that they might have [[liberty]] to embrace one another in this dying
condition, with so close and hearty an embrace, that the executioner cut
off both their heads at once, leaving the bodies [[body]] still fast linked
together in this [[noble]] bond, and their wounds joined mouth to mouth,
affectionately sucking in the [[last]] [[blood]] and remainder of the lives [[life]] of
each other.




chapter xxxiv

of one defect in our government

my late [[father]], a [[man]] that had no other advantages than [[experience]] and
his own [[natural]] parts, was nevertheless of a very clear [[judgment]],
formerly told me that he once had thoughts [[thought]] of endeavouring to introduce
this practice; that there might be in every [[city]] a [[certain]] place assigned
to which such as stood in need of anything might repair, and have their
business entered by an officer appointed for that [[purpose]].  as for
example: i want a chapman to buy my pearls; i want one that has pearls to
sell; such a one wants company to go to [[paris]]; such a one seeks a servant
of such a quality; such a one a master; such a one such an artificer;
some inquiring for one thing, some for another, every one according to
what he wants.  and doubtless, these mutual advertisements would be of no
contemptible advantage to the [[public]] correspondence and [[intelligence]]: for
there are evermore conditions that hunt after one another, and for want
of knowing one another’s occasions [[occasion]] leave [[men]] in very [[great]] necessity.

i have heard, to the [[great]] shame of the [[age]] we [[live]] in, that in our very
sight two most excellent [[men]] for learning died so [[poor]] that they had
scarce bread to put in their mouths: lilius gregorius giraldus in italy
and sebastianus castalio in germany: and i [[believe]] there are a thousand
men would have invited them into their families [[family]], with very advantageous
conditions, or have relieved them where they were, had they known their
wants.  the [[world]] is not so generally corrupted, but that i [[know]] a man
that would heartily [[wish]] the estate his [[ancestors]] have left him might be
employed, so long as it shall please [[fortune]] to give him leave to enjoy
it, to secure rare and remarkable persons [[person]] of any [[kind]], whom misfortune
sometimes persecutes to the [[last]] [[degree]], from the dangers of necessity;
and at least place them in such a condition that they must be very hard
to please, if they are not contented.

my [[father]] in his domestic economy had this [[rule]] (which i [[know]] how to
commend, but by no means to imitate), namely, that besides the day-book
or memorial of household affairs, where the small accounts, payments, and
disbursements, which do not require a secretary’s hand, were entered, and
which a steward always had in custody, he ordered him whom he employed to
write for him, to keep a journal, and in it to set down all the
remarkable occurrences, and daily memorials of the [[history]] of his house:
very pleasant to look over, when [[time]] begins to wear things out of
memory, and very useful sometimes to put us out of [[doubt]] when such a
thing was begun, when ended; what visitors came, and when they went; our
travels, absences, marriages [[marriage]], and deaths [[death]]; the reception of [[good]] or ill
news; the [[change]] of principal servants, and the like.  an ancient custom,
which i [[think]] it would not be amiss for every one to revive in his own
house; and i find i did very foolishly in neglecting it.




chapter xxxv

of the custom of wearing clothes

whatever i shall say upon this [[subject]], i am of necessity to invade some
of the bounds of custom, so careful has she been to shut up all the
avenues.  i was disputing with myself in this shivering season, whether
the [[fashion]] of going naked in those nations lately discovered is imposed
upon them by the hot temperature of the air, as we say of the indians [[indian]] and
moors, or whether it be the original [[fashion]] of [[mankind]].  [[men]] of
understanding, forasmuch as all things under the sun, as the holy writ
declares, are [[subject]] to the same laws [[law]], were wont in such considerations
as these, where we are to distinguish the [[natural]] laws [[law]] from those which
have been imposed by man’s invention, to have recourse to the general
polity of the [[world]], where there can be nothing counterfeit.  now, all
other creatures being sufficiently furnished with all things necessary
for the support of their being--[montaigne’s expression is, “with needle
and thread.”--w.c.h.]--it is not to be imagined that we only are brought
into the [[world]] in a defective and indigent condition, and in such a state
as cannot subsist without external aid.  therefore it is that i [[believe]],
that as plants, trees, and animals, and all things that have [[life]], are
seen to be by [[nature]] sufficiently clothed and covered, to defend them
from the injuries of weather:

         “proptereaque fere res omnes ant corio sunt,
          aut seta, ant conchis, ant callo, ant cortice tectae,”

     [“and that for this [[reason]] nearly all things are clothed with skin,
     or hair, or shells, or bark, or some such thing.”
      --lucretius, iv. 936.]

so were we: but as those who by artificial [[light]] put out that of day, so
we by borrowed forms and fashions have destroyed our own.  and ‘tis plain
enough to be seen, that ‘tis custom only which renders that impossible
that otherwise is nothing so; for of those nations who have no manner of
knowledge of clothing, some are situated under the same temperature that
we are, and some in much colder climates.  and besides, our most tender
parts are always exposed to the air, as the [[eyes]], mouth, nose, and ears;
and our [[country]] labourers, like our [[ancestors]] in former times [[time]], go with
their breasts and bellies open.  had we been born with a necessity upon
us of wearing petticoats and breeches, there is no [[doubt]] but [[nature]] would
have fortified those parts she intended should be exposed to the fury of
the seasons with a thicker skin, as she has done the finger-ends and the
soles of the feet.  and why should this seem hard to [[believe]]?  i observe
much greater distance betwixt my habit and that of one of our country
boors, than betwixt his and that of a [[man]] who has no other covering but
his skin.  how many [[men]], especially in turkey, go naked upon the account
of devotion?  some one [[asked]] a beggar, whom he saw in his shirt in the
depth of winter, as brisk and frolic as he who goes muffled up to the
ears in furs, how he was able to endure to go so?  “why, sir,” he
answered, “you go with your face bare: i am all face.”  the italians have
a story of the duke of florence’s [[fool]], whom his master asking how, being
so thinly clad, he was able to support the cold, when he himself, warmly
wrapped up as he was, was hardly able to do it?  “why,” replied the [[fool]],
“use my receipt to put on all your clothes you have at once, and you’ll
feel no more cold than i.”  [[king]] massinissa, to an extreme old [[age]], could
never be prevailed upon to go with his head covered, how cold, stormy, or
rainy soever the weather might be; which also is reported of the emperor
severus.  herodotus tells us, that in the battles [[battle]] fought betwixt the
egyptians and the persians, it was observed both by himself and by
others, that of those who were left [[dead]] upon the field, the heads of the
egyptians were without comparison harder than those of the persians, by
reason that the [[last]] had gone with their heads always covered from their
infancy, first with biggins, and then with turbans, and the others always
shaved and bare.  [[king]] agesilaus continued to a decrepit [[age]] to wear
always the same clothes in winter that he did in summer.  caesar, says
suetonius, marched always at the head of his [[army]], for the most part on
foot, with his head bare, whether it was rain or sunshine, and as much is
said of hannibal:

                              “tum vertice nudo,
               excipere insanos imbres, coelique ruinam.”

     [“bareheaded he marched in snow, exposed to pouring rain and the
     utmost rigour of the weather.”--silius italicus, i. 250.]

a venetian who has long lived in pegu, and has lately returned thence,
writes that the [[men]] and [[women]] of that [[kingdom]], though they cover all
their other parts, go always barefoot and ride so too; and [[plato]] very
earnestly advises for the health of the whole [[body]], to give the head and
the feet no other clothing than what [[nature]] has bestowed.  he whom the
poles have elected for their [[king]],--[stephen bathory]--since ours came
thence, who is, indeed, one of the [[greatest]] princes [[prince]] of this [[age]], never
wears any gloves, and in winter or whatever weather can come, never wears
other cap abroad than that he wears at [[home]].  whereas i cannot endure to
go unbuttoned or untied; my neighbouring labourers would [[think]] themselves
in chains, if they were so braced.  varro is of [[opinion]], that when it was
ordained we should be bare in the presence of the gods and before the
magistrate, it was so ordered rather upon the score of health, and to
inure us to the injuries of weather, than upon the account of reverence;
and since we are now talking of cold, and frenchmen used to wear variety
of colours (not i myself, for i seldom wear other than black or [[white]], in
imitation of my father), let us add another story out of le capitaine
martin du bellay, who affirms, that in the march to luxembourg he saw so
great frost, that the munition-wine was cut with hatchets and wedges, and
delivered out to the soldiers by weight, and that they carried it away in
baskets: and ovid,

              “nudaque consistunt, formam servantia testae,
               vina; nec hausta meri, sed data frusta, bibunt.”

     [“the wine when out of the cask retains the form of the cask;
     and is given out not in cups, but in bits.”
      --ovid, trist., iii. 10, 23.]

at the mouth of lake maeotis the frosts are so very sharp, that in the
very same place where mithridates’ lieutenant had fought the enemy
dryfoot and given them a notable defeat, the summer following he obtained
over them a naval [[victory]].  the romans fought at a very great
disadvantage, in the engagement they had with the carthaginians near
piacenza, by [[reason]] that they went to the charge with their blood
congealed and their limbs numbed with cold, whereas hannibal had caused
great fires [[fire]] to be dispersed quite through his camp to warm his soldiers,
and [[oil]] to be distributed amongst them, to the end that anointing
themselves, they might render their nerves more supple and active, and
fortify the pores against the [[violence]] of the air and freezing wind,
which raged in that season.

the retreat the greeks [[greek]] made from [[babylon]] into their own [[country]] is famous
for the difficulties and calamities they had to overcome; of which this
was one, that being encountered in the mountains of armenia with a
horrible storm of snow, they lost all [[knowledge]] of the [[country]] and of the
ways, and being driven up, were a day and a night without eating or
drinking; most of their cattle died, many of themselves were starved to
death, several struck blind with the [[force]] of the hail and the glare of
the snow, many of them maimed in their fingers and toes, and many stiff
and motionless with the extremity of the cold, who had yet their
understanding entire.

alexander saw a nation, where they bury their fruit-trees in winter to
protect them from being destroyed by the frost, and we also may see the
same.

but, so far as clothes go, the [[king]] of mexico changed four times [[time]] a day
his apparel, and never put it on again, employing that he left off in his
continual liberalities and rewards [[reward]]; and neither pot, dish, nor other
utensil of his kitchen or table was ever served twice.




chapter xxxvi

of cato the younger

     [“i am not possessed with this [[common]] errour, to [[judge]] of others
     according to what i am my selfe.  i am easie to beleeve things
     differing from my selfe.  though i be engaged to one forme, i do not
     tie the [[world]] unto it, as every [[man]] doth.  and i beleeve and
     conceive a thousand manners of [[life]], contrary to the [[common]] sorte.”
      --florio, ed. 1613, p. 113.]

i am not guilty of the [[common]] error of judging another by myself.  i
easily [[believe]] that in another’s [[humour]] which is contrary to my own; and
though i find myself engaged to one [[certain]] form, i do not oblige others
to it, as many do; but [[believe]] and apprehend a thousand ways of living;
and, contrary to most [[men]], more easily admit of difference than
uniformity amongst us.  i as frankly as any one would have me, discharge
a [[man]] from my humours [[humour]] and principles [[principle]], and consider him according to his
own particular model.  though i am not continent myself, i nevertheless
sincerely approve the continence of the feuillans and capuchins, and
highly commend their way of living.  i insinuate myself by imagination
into their place, and [[love]] and [[honour]] them the more for being other than
i am.  i very much [[desire]] that we may be judged every [[man]] by himself, and
would not be drawn into the consequence of [[common]] examples [[example]].  my own
weakness nothing alters the esteem i ought to have for the [[force]] and
vigour of those who deserve it:

     “sunt qui nihil suadent, quam quod se imitari posse confidunt.”

     [“there are who persuade nothing but what they [[believe]] they can
     imitate themselves.”--cicero, de orator., c. 7.]

crawling upon the slime of the [[earth]], i do not for all that cease to
observe up in the clouds the inimitable height of some heroic souls [[soul]].
‘tis a [[great]] deal for me to have my [[judgment]] regular and just, if the
effects cannot be so, and to maintain this [[sovereign]] part, at least, free
from [[corruption]]; ‘tis something to have my will [[right]] and [[good]] where my
legs fail me.  this [[age]] wherein we [[live]], in our part of the [[world]] at
least, is grown so stupid, that not only the exercise, but the very
imagination of [[virtue]] is defective, and seems to be no other but college
jargon:

                        “virtutem verba putant, ut
                 lucum ligna:”

     [“they [[think]] words [[virtue]], as they [[think]] mere wood a [[sacred]] grove.”
      --horace, ep., i. 6, 31.]

          “quam vereri deberent, etiam si percipere non possent.”

     [“which they ought to reverence, though they cannot comprehend.”
      --cicero, tusc. quas., v. 2.]

‘tis a gewgaw to hang in a cabinet or at the end of the tongue, as on the
tip of the ear, for ornament only.  there are no longer [[virtuous]] actions
extant; those actions that carry a show of [[virtue]] have yet nothing of its
essence; by [[reason]] that [[profit]], [[glory]], [[fear]], custom, and other suchlike
foreign causes, put us on the way to [[produce]] them.  our [[justice]] also,
valour, courtesy, may be called so too, in [[respect]] to others and
according to the face they appear with to the [[public]]; but in the doer it
can by no means be [[virtue]], because there is another end proposed, another
moving cause.  now [[virtue]] owns nothing to be hers, but what is done by
herself and for herself alone.

in that [[great]] [[battle]] of plataea, that the greeks [[greek]] under the command of
pausanias gained against mardonius and the persians, the conquerors,
according to their custom, coming to divide amongst them the [[glory]] of the
exploit, attributed to the spartan nation the pre-eminence of valour in
the engagement.  the spartans, [[great]] judges [[judge]] of [[virtue]], when they came to
determine to what particular [[man]] of their nation the [[honour]] was due of
having the [[best]] behaved himself upon this [[occasion]], found that
aristodemus had of all others hazarded his [[person]] with the greatest
bravery; but did not, however, allow him any prize, by [[reason]] that his
virtue had been incited by a [[desire]] to clear his [[reputation]] from the
reproach of his miscarriage at the [[business]] of thermopylae, and to die
bravely to wipe off that former blemish.

our judgments [[judgment]] are yet sick, and obey the [[humour]] of our depraved manners.
i observe most of the wits of these times [[time]] pretend to ingenuity, by
endeavouring to blemish and darken the [[glory]] of the bravest and most
generous actions of former ages [[age]], putting one vile interpretation or
another upon them, and forging and supposing [[vain]] causes and motives for
the [[noble]] things they did: a mighty subtlety indeed!  give me the
greatest and most unblemished action that ever the day beheld, and i will
contrive a hundred plausible drifts and ends to obscure it.  [[god]] knows [[know]],
whoever will stretch them out to the full, what [[diversity]] of images our
internal wills suffer under.  they do not so maliciously play the
censurers, as they do it ignorantly and rudely in all their detractions.

the same pains [[pain]] and licence that others take to blemish and bespatter
these illustrious names, i would willingly undergo to lend them a
shoulder to raise them higher.  these rare forms, that are culled out by
the [[consent]] of the wisest [[men]] of all ages [[age]], for the world’s [[example]],
i should not stick to augment in [[honour]], as far as my invention would
permit, in all the circumstances of favourable interpretation; and we may
well [[believe]] that the [[force]] of our invention is infinitely short of their
merit.  ‘tis the [[duty]] of [[good]] [[men]] to portray [[virtue]] as beautiful as they
can, and there would be nothing [[wrong]] should our passion a little
transport us in favour of so [[sacred]] a form.  what these [[people]] do, on the
contrary, they either do out of malice, or by the [[vice]] of confining their
belief to their own capacity; or, which i am more inclined to [[think]], for
not having their sight [[strong]], clear, and elevated enough to conceive the
splendour of [[virtue]] in her native purity: as plutarch complains, that in
his [[time]] some attributed the cause of the younger cato’s [[death]] to his
fear of caesar, at which he seems very angry, and with [[good]] [[reason]]; and
by this a [[man]] may guess how much more he would have been offended with
those who have attributed it to [[ambition]].  senseless people!  he would
rather have performed a [[noble]], just, and generous action, and to have had
ignominy for his [[reward]], than for [[glory]].  that [[man]] was in [[truth]] a pattern
that [[nature]] chose out to show to what height [[human]] [[virtue]] and constancy
could arrive.

but i am not capable of handling so [[rich]] an argument, and shall therefore
only set five latin poets together, contending in the [[praise]] of cato;
and, incidentally, for their own too.  now, a well-educated child will
judge the two first, in comparison of the others, a little flat and
languid; the third more vigorous, but overthrown by the extravagance of
his own [[force]]; he will then [[think]] that there will be room for one or two
gradations of invention to come to the fourth, and, mounting to the pitch
of that, he will lift up his hands in admiration; coming to the [[last]], the
first by some space’ (but a space that he will swear is not to be filled
up by any [[human]] wit), he will be astounded, he will not [[know]] where he is.

and here is a wonder: we have far more poets than judges [[judge]] and interpreters
of poetry; it is easier to write it than to [[understand]] it.  there is,
indeed, a [[certain]] low and moderate sort of poetry, that a [[man]] may well
enough [[judge]] by [[certain]] rules [[rule]] of art [[arts]]; but the true, supreme, and divine
poesy is above all rules [[rule]] and [[reason]].  and whoever discerns the [[beauty]] of
it with the most assured and most steady sight, sees no more than the
quick reflection of a flash of lightning: it does not exercise, but
ravishes and overwhelms our [[judgment]].  the fury that possesses him who is
able to penetrate into it wounds yet a third [[man]] by hearing him repeat
it; like a loadstone that not only attracts the needle, but also infuses
into it the [[virtue]] to attract others.  and it is more evidently manifest
in our theatres, that the [[sacred]] inspiration of the muses, having first
stirred up the poet to anger, [[sorrow]], [[hatred]], and out of himself, to
whatever they will, does moreover by the poet possess the actor, and by
the actor consecutively all the spectators.  so much do our [[passions]] hang
and depend upon one another.

poetry has ever had that [[power]] over me from a child to transpierce and
transport me; but this vivid sentiment that is [[natural]] to me has been
variously handled by variety of forms, not so much higher or lower (for
they were ever the highest of every kind), as differing in colour.
first, a [[gay]] and sprightly fluency; afterwards, a lofty and penetrating
subtlety; and lastly, a mature and constant vigour.  their names will
better express them: ovid, lucan, [[virgil]].

but our poets are beginning their [[career]]:

         “sit cato, dum vivit, sane vel caesare major,”

     [“let cato, whilst he [[live]], be greater than caesar.”
      --martial, vi. 32]

says one.

               “et invictum, devicta morte, catonem,”

          [“and cato invincible, [[death]] being overcome.”
           --manilius, astron., iv. 87.]

says the second.  and the third, speaking of the civil wars [[war]] betwixt
caesar and pompey,

          “victrix causa diis placuit, set victa catoni.”

     [“the victorious cause blessed the gods, the defeated one cato.
     --“lucan, i. 128.]

and the fourth, upon the praises [[praise]] of caesar:

              “et cuncta terrarum subacta,
               praeter atrocem animum catonis.”

     [“and conquered all but the indomitable [[mind]] of cato.”
      --horace, od., ii. 1, 23.]

and the master of the choir, after having set forth all the [[great]] names
of the [[greatest]] romans, ends thus:

                    “his dantem jura catonem.”

     [“cato giving laws [[law]] to all the rest.”--aeneid, viii. 670.]




chapter xxxvii

that we laugh and cry for the same thing

when we [[read]] in [[history]] that antigonus was very much displeased with his
son for presenting him the head of [[king]] pyrrhus his [[enemy]], but newly
slain fighting against him, and that seeing it, he wept; and that rene,
duke of lorraine, also lamented the [[death]] of charles, duke of burgundy,
whom he had himself defeated, and appeared in mourning at his [[funeral]];
and that in the [[battle]] of d’auray (which count montfort obtained over
charles de blois, his competitor for the duchy of brittany), the
conqueror meeting the [[dead]] [[body]] of his [[enemy]], was very much afflicted at
his [[death]], we must not presently cry out:

              “e cosi avven, the l’animo ciascuna
               sua passion sotto ‘l contrario manto,
               ricopre, con la vista or’chiara, or’bruna.”

     [“and thus it happens that the [[mind]] of each veils its passion under
     a different appearance, and beneath a smiling visage, [[gay]] beneath a
     sombre air.”--petrarch.]

when pompey’s head was presented to caesar, the histories [[history]] tell us that he
turned away his face, as from a [[sad]] and unpleasing object.  there had
been so long an [[intelligence]] and [[society]] betwixt them in the management
of the [[public]] affairs, so [[great]] a [[community]] of fortunes [[fortune]], so many mutual
offices, and so near an [[alliance]], that this countenance of his ought not
to suffer under any misinterpretation, or to be suspected for either
false or counterfeit, as this other seems to [[believe]]:

                             “tutumque putavit
          jam bonus esse socer; lacrymae non sponte cadentes,
          effudit, gemitusque expressit pectore laeto;”

     [“and now he [[thought]] it safe to play the [[kind]] father-in-law,
     shedding forced tears, and from a joyful breast discharging sighs
     and groans.”--lucan, ix. 1037.]

for though it be true that the [[greatest]] part of our actions are no other
than visor and [[disguise]], and that it may sometimes be true that

               “haeredis fletus sub persona rises est,”

          [“the heir’s tears behind the mask are smiles.”
           --publius syrus, apud gellium, xvii. 14.]

yet, in judging of these accidents, we are to consider how much our souls
are oftentimes agitated with divers [[passions]].  and as they say that in
our bodies [[body]] there is a congregation of divers humours [[humour]], of which that is
the [[sovereign]] which, according to the [[complexion]] we are of, is commonly
most predominant in us: so, though the [[soul]] have in it divers motions to
give it agitation, yet must there of necessity be one to overrule all the
rest, though not with so necessary and absolute a dominion but that
through the flexibility and inconstancy of the [[soul]], those of less
authority may upon [[occasion]] reassume their place and make a little sally
in turn.  thence it is, that we see not only [[children]], who innocently
obey and [[follow]] [[nature]], often laugh and cry at the same thing, but not
one of us can boast, what [[journey]] soever he may have in hand that he has
the most set his [[heart]] upon, but when he comes to part with his family
and [[friends]], he will find something that troubles him within; and though
he refrain his tears yet he puts foot in the stirrup with a [[sad]] and
cloudy countenance.  and what gentle flame soever may warm the [[heart]] of
modest and wellborn virgins, yet are they fain to be forced from about
their mothers’ necks to be put to bed to their husbands, whatever this
boon companion is pleased to say:

         “estne novis nuptis odio [[venus]]?  anne parentum
          frustrantur falsis gaudia lachrymulis,
          ubertim thalami quasi intra limina fundunt?
          non, ita me divi, vera gemunt, juverint.”

     [“is [[venus]] really so alarming to the new-made bride, or does she
     honestly oppose her parent’s rejoicing the tears she so abundantly
     sheds on entering the nuptial chamber?  no, by the gods, these are
     no true tears.”--catullus, lxvi. 15.]

     [“is [[venus]] really so repugnant to newly-married maids?  do they meet
     the smiles of parents with feigned tears?  they weep copiously
     within the very threshold of the nuptial chamber.  no, so the gods
     [[help]] me, they do not truly grieve.”--catullus, lxvi.  15.]--
     [a more literal translation.  d.w.]

neither is it [[strange]] to lament a [[person]] [[dead]] whom a [[man]] would by no
means should be alive.  when i rattle my [[man]], i do it with all the mettle
i have, and load him with no feigned, but downright real curses; but the
heat being over, if he should stand in need of me, i should be very ready
to do him [[good]]: for i instantly turn the leaf.  when i call him calf and
coxcomb, i do not pretend to entail those titles upon him for ever;
neither do i [[think]] i give myself the [[lie]] in calling him an honest fellow
presently after.  no one quality engrosses us purely and universally.
were it not the sign of a [[fool]] to talk to one’s [[self]], there would hardly
be a day or hour wherein i might not be heard to grumble and mutter to
myself and against myself, “confound the fool!” and yet i do not think
that to be my definition.  who for seeing me one while cold and presently
very fond towards my [[wife]], believes [[belief]] the one or the other to be
counterfeited, is an ass.  nero, taking leave of his [[mother]] whom he was
sending to be drowned, was nevertheless sensible of some emotion at this
farewell, and was struck with [[horror]] and [[pity]].  ‘tis said, that the light
of the sun is not one continuous thing, but that he darts new rays so
thick one upon another that we cannot perceive the intermission:

         “largus enim liquidi fons luminis, aetherius sol,
          irrigat assidue coelum candore recenti,
          suppeditatque novo confestim lumine lumen.”

     [“so the wide fountain of liquid [[light]], the ethereal sun, steadily
     fertilises the heavens [[heaven]] with new heat, and supplies a continuous
     store of fresh [[light]].”--lucretius, v. 282.]

just so the [[soul]] variously and imperceptibly darts out her [[passions]].

artabanus coming by surprise once upon his nephew xerxes, chid him for
the sudden alteration of his countenance.  he was considering the
immeasurable greatness of his forces [[force]] passing over the hellespont for the
grecian expedition: he was first seized with a palpitation of joy, to see
so many millions of [[men]] under his command, and this appeared in the
gaiety of his looks: but his thoughts [[thought]] at the same instant suggesting to
him that of so many lives [[life]], within a century at most, there would not be
one left, he presently knit his brows and grew [[sad]], even to tears.

we have resolutely pursued the [[revenge]] of an injury received, and been
sensible of a singular contentment for the [[victory]]; but we shall weep
notwithstanding.  ‘tis not for the [[victory]], though, that we shall weep:
there is nothing altered in that but the [[soul]] looks upon things with
another eye and represents them to itself with another [[kind]] of face; for
everything has many faces and several aspects.

relations, old acquaintances, and friendships [[friendship]], possess our imaginations
and make them tender for the [[time]], according to their condition; but the
turn is so quick, that ‘tis gone in a moment:

              “nil adeo fieri celeri ratione videtur,
               quam si mens [[men]] fieri proponit, et inchoat ipsa,
               ocius ergo animus, quam res se perciet ulla,
               ante oculos quorum in promptu natura videtur;”

     [“nothing therefore seems to be done in so swift a manner than if
     the [[mind]] proposes it to be done, and itself begins.  it is more
     active than anything which we see in [[nature]].”--lucretius, iii. 183.]

and therefore, if we would make one continued thing of all this
succession of [[passions]], we [[deceive]] ourselves.  when timoleon laments the
murder he had committed upon so mature and generous deliberation, he does
not lament the [[liberty]] restored to his [[country]], he does not lament the
tyrant; but he laments his [[brother]]: one part of his [[duty]] is performed;
let us give him leave to perform the other.




chapter xxxviii

of solitude

let us pretermit that long comparison betwixt the active and the solitary
life; and as for the fine sayings with which [[ambition]] and avarice
palliate their vices [[vice]], that we are not born for ourselves but for the
public,--[this is the eulogium passed by lucan on cato of utica, ii.
383.]--let us boldly appeal to those who are in [[public]] affairs; let them
lay their hands upon their hearts [[heart]], and then say whether, on the contrary,
they do not rather aspire to titles and offices and that tumult of the
world to make their private advantage at the [[public]] expense.  the corrupt
ways by which in this our [[time]] they arrive at the height to which their
ambitions aspire, manifestly enough declares that their ends cannot be
very [[good]].  let us tell [[ambition]] that it is she herself who gives us a
taste of solitude; for what does she so much avoid as [[society]]?  what does
she so much seek as elbowroom?  a [[man]] many do well or ill everywhere; but
if what bias says be true, that the [[greatest]] part is the worse part, or
what the preacher says: there is not one [[good]] of a thousand:

              “rari quippe boni: numero vix sunt totidem quot
               thebarum portae, vel divitis ostia nili,”

     [“good [[men]] forsooth are scarce: there are hardly as many as there
     are gates of thebes or mouths of the [[rich]] nile.”
      --juvenal, sat., xiii. 26.]

the contagion is very dangerous in the crowd.  a [[man]] must either imitate
the vicious or hate them both are dangerous things, either to resemble
them because they are many or to hate many because they are unresembling
to ourselves.  merchants who go to sea are in the [[right]] when they are
cautious that those who embark with them in the same bottom be neither
dissolute blasphemers nor vicious other ways, looking upon such society
as unfortunate.  and therefore it was that bias pleasantly said to some,
who being with him in a dangerous storm implored the assistance of the
gods: “peace, speak softly,” said he, “that they may not [[know]] you are
here in my company.”--[diogenes laertius]--and of more pressing
example, albuquerque, viceroy in the indies for emmanuel, [[king]] of
portugal, in an extreme peril of shipwreck, took a [[young]] boy upon his
shoulders, for this only end that, in the [[society]] of their [[common]] danger
his innocence might serve to [[protect]] him, and to recommend him to the
divine favour, that they might get safe to shore.  ‘tis not that a wise
man may not [[live]] everywhere content, and be alone in the very crowd of a
palace; but if it be left to his own [[choice]], the schoolman will tell you
that he should fly the very sight of the crowd: he will endure it if need
be; but if it be referred to him, he will choose to be alone.  he cannot
think himself sufficiently rid of [[vice]], if he must yet contend with it in
other [[men]].  charondas punished those as [[evil]] [[men]] who were convicted of
keeping ill company.  there is nothing so unsociable and sociable as [[man]],
the one by his [[vice]], the other by his [[nature]].  and antisthenes, in my
opinion, did not give him a satisfactory [[answer]], who reproached him with
frequenting ill company, by saying that the physicians lived well enough
amongst the sick, for if they contribute to the health of the sick, no
doubt but by the contagion, continual sight of, and familiarity with
diseases, they must of necessity impair their own.

now the end, i take it, is all one, to [[live]] at more leisure and at one’s
ease: but [[men]] do not always take the [[right]] way.  they often [[think]] they
have totally taken leave of all [[business]], when they have only exchanged
one employment for another: there is little less trouble in governing a
private [[family]] than a whole [[kingdom]].  wherever the [[mind]] is perplexed, it
is in an entire disorder, and domestic employments are not less
troublesome for being less important.  moreover, for having shaken off
the court and the exchange, we have not taken leave of the principal
vexations of [[life]]:

              “ratio et prudentia curas,
               non locus effusi late maris arbiter, aufert;”

     [“reason and prudence, not a place with a commanding view of the
     [[great]] ocean, banish [[care]].”--horace, ep., i. 2.]

ambition, avarice, irresolution, [[fear]], and inordinate desires [[desire]], do not
leave us because we forsake our native [[country]]:

                                        “et
                    post equitem sedet atra cura;”

               [“black [[care]] sits behind the horse [[man]].”
                --horace, od., iii. 1, 40].

they often [[follow]] us even to cloisters and philosophical schools; nor
deserts, nor caves, hair-shirts, nor fasts, can disengage us from them:

                    “haeret lateri lethalis arundo.”

          [“the fatal shaft adheres to the side.”--aeneid, iv. 73.]

one telling [[socrates]] that such a one was nothing improved by his travels:
“i very well [[believe]] it,” said he, “for he took himself along with him”

                   “quid terras alio calentes
                    sole mutamus?  patriae quis exsul
                    se quoque fugit?”

     [“why do we seek climates warmed by another sun?  who is the man
     that by fleeing from his [[country]], can also flee from himself?”
      --horace, od., ii. 16, 18.]

if a [[man]] do not first discharge both himself and his [[mind]] of the burden
with which he finds himself [[oppressed]], motion will but make it press the
harder and sit the heavier, as the lading of a ship is of less
encumbrance when fast and bestowed in a settled posture.  you do a sick
man more harm than [[good]] in removing him from place to place; you fix and
establish the disease by motion, as stakes sink deeper and more firmly
into the [[earth]] by being moved up and down in the place where they are
designed to stand.  therefore, it is not enough to get remote from the
public; ‘tis not enough to shift the soil only; a [[man]] must flee from the
popular conditions that have taken possession of his [[soul]], he must
sequester and come again to himself:

                         “rupi jam vincula, dicas
               nam luctata canis nodum arripit; attamen illi,
               quum fugit, a collo trahitur pars longa catenae.”

     [“you say, perhaps, you have broken your chains: the dog who after
     long efforts has broken his chain, still in his flight drags a heavy
     portion of it after him.”--persius, sat., v. 158.]

we still carry our fetters along with us.  ‘tis not an absolute [[liberty]];
we yet cast back a look upon what we have left behind us; the fancy is
still full of it:

          “nisi purgatum est pectus, quae praelia nobis
          atque pericula tunc ingratis insinuandum?
          quantae connscindunt hominem cupedinis acres
          sollicitum curae? quantique perinde timores?
          quidve superbia, spurcitia, ac petulantia, quantas
          efficiunt clades? quid luxus desidiesque?”

     [“but unless the [[mind]] is purified, what internal combats and dangers
     must we incur in spite of all our efforts!  how many bitter
     anxieties, how many terrors, [[follow]] upon unregulated passion!
     what destruction befalls us from [[pride]], [[lust]], petulant anger!
     what evils [[evil]] arise from luxury and sloth!”--lucretius, v. 4.]

our disease lies [[lie]] in the [[mind]], which cannot escape from itself;

          “in culpa est animus, qui se non effugit unquam,”
           --horace, ep., i. 14, 13.

and therefore is to be called [[home]] and confined within itself: that is
the true solitude, and that may be enjoyed even in populous cities [[city]] and
the courts of kings [[king]], though more commodiously apart.

now, since we will attempt to [[live]] alone, and to waive all manner of
conversation amongst them, let us so order it that our content may depend
wholly upon ourselves; let us dissolve all obligations that ally us to
others; let us obtain this from ourselves, that we may [[live]] alone in good
earnest, and [[live]] at our ease too.

stilpo having escaped from the burning of his town, where he lost [[wife]],
children, and goods [[good]], demetrius poliorcetes seeing him, in so [[great]] a ruin
of his [[country]], appear with an undisturbed countenance, [[asked]] him if he
had received no loss?  to which he made [[answer]], no; and that, thank [[god]],
nothing was lost of his.--[seneca, ep. 7.]--this also was the meaning of
the philosopher antisthenes, when he pleasantly said, that “men should
furnish themselves with such things as would float, and might with the
owner escape the storm”;--[diogenes laertius, vi. 6.] and certainly a
wise [[man]] never loses anything if he have himself.  when the [[city]] of nola
was ruined by the barbarians, paulinus, who was bishop of that place,
having there lost all he had, himself a [[prisoner]], prayed after this
manner: “o [[lord]], defend me from being sensible of this loss; for thou
knowest they have yet touched nothing of that which is mine.”--[st.
augustin, de civit. dei, i. 10.]--the riches [[rich]] that made him [[rich]] and the
goods that made him [[good]], were still kept entire.  this it is to make
choice of treasures that can secure themselves from plunder and [[violence]],
and to hide them in such a place into which no one can enter and that is
not to be betrayed by any but ourselves.  wives [[wife]], [[children]], and goods [[good]] must
be had, and especially health, by him that can get it; but we are not so
to set our hearts [[heart]] upon them that our [[happiness]] must have its dependence
upon them; we must reserve a backshop, wholly our own and entirely [[free]],
wherein to settle our true [[liberty]], our principal solitude and retreat.
and in this we must for the most part entertain ourselves with ourselves,
and so privately that no exotic [[knowledge]] or communication be admitted
there; there to laugh and to talk, as if without [[wife]], [[children]], goods [[good]],
train, or attendance, to the end that when it shall so fall out that we
must lose any or all of these, it may be no new thing to be without them.
we have a [[mind]] pliable in itself, that will be company; that has
wherewithal to attack and to defend, to receive and to give: let us not
then [[fear]] in this solitude to languish under an uncomfortable vacuity.

                    “in solis sis tibi turba locis.”

     [“in solitude, be company for thyself.”--tibullus, vi. 13. 12.]

virtue is satisfied with herself, without discipline, without words,
without effects.  in our ordinary actions there is not one of a thousand
that concerns ourselves.  he that thou seest scrambling up the ruins of
that wall, furious and transported, against whom so many harquebuss-shots
are levelled; and that other all over scars, pale, and fainting with
hunger, and yet resolved rather to [[die]] than to open the gates to him;
dost thou [[think]] that these [[men]] are there upon their own account?  no;
peradventure in the behalf of one whom they never saw and who never
concerns himself for their pains [[pain]] and danger, but lies [[lie]] wallowing the while
in sloth and [[pleasure]]: this other slavering, blear-eyed, slovenly fellow,
that thou seest come out of his study after midnight, dost thou [[think]] he
has been tumbling over books [[book]] to learn how to become a [[better]] [[man]], wiser,
and more content?  no such matter; he will there end his days, but he
will [[teach]] [[posterity]] the measure of plautus’ verses and the true
orthography of a latin word.  who is it that does not voluntarily
exchange his health, his repose, and his very [[life]] for [[reputation]] and
glory, the most useless, frivolous, and false coin that passes current
amongst us?  our own [[death]] does not sufficiently terrify and trouble us;
let us, moreover, charge ourselves with those of our wives [[wife]], [[children]], and
family: our own affairs do not afford us [[anxiety]] enough; let us undertake
those of our neighbours and [[friends]], still more to break our brains and
torment us:

         “vah! quemquamne hominem in animum instituere, aut
          parare, quod sit carius, quam ipse est sibi?”

     [“ah! can any [[man]] conceive in his [[mind]] or realise what is dearer
     than he is to himself?”--terence, adelph., i. i, 13.]

solitude seems to me to wear the [[best]] favour in such as have already
employed their most active and flourishing [[age]] in the world’s service,
after the [[example]] of thales.  we have lived enough for others; let us at
least [[live]] out the small remnant of [[life]] for ourselves; let us now call
in our thoughts [[thought]] and intentions to ourselves, and to our own ease and
repose.  ‘tis no [[light]] thing to make a sure retreat; it will be enough
for us to do without mixing other enterprises.  since [[god]] gives us
leisure to order our removal, let us make ready, truss our baggage, take
leave betimes of the company, and disentangle ourselves from those
violent importunities that engage us elsewhere and separate us from
ourselves.

we must break the knot of our obligations, how [[strong]] soever, and
hereafter [[love]] this or that, but espouse nothing but ourselves: that is
to say, let the remainder be our own, but not so joined and so close as
not to be forced away without flaying us or tearing out part of our
whole.  the [[greatest]] thing in the [[world]] is for a [[man]] to [[know]] that he is
his own.  ‘tis [[time]] to wean ourselves from [[society]] when we can no longer
add anything to it; he who is not in a condition to lend must forbid
himself to borrow.  our forces [[force]] begin to fail us; let us call them in and
concentrate them in and for ourselves.  he that can cast off within
himself and resolve the offices of [[friendship]] and company, let him do it.
in this decay of [[nature]] which renders him useless, burdensome, and
importunate to others, let him take [[care]] not to be useless, burdensome,
and importunate to himself.  let him soothe and caress himself, and above
all things be sure to govern himself with reverence to his [[reason]] and
conscience to that [[degree]] as to be ashamed to make a false step in their
presence:

               “rarum est enim, ut satis se quisque vereatur.”

     [“for ‘tis rarely seen that [[men]] have [[respect]] and reverence enough
     for themselves.”--quintilian, x. 7.]

socrates says that boys are to cause themselves to be instructed, [[men]] to
exercise themselves in well-doing, and old [[men]] to retire from all civil
and [[military]] employments, living at their own discretion, without the
obligation to any office. there are some complexions more proper for
these precepts of retirement than others.  such as are of a soft and dull
apprehension, and of a tender will and affection, not readily to be
subdued or employed, whereof i am one, both by [[natural]] condition and by
reflection, will sooner incline to this [[advice]] than active and busy
souls, which embrace: all, engage in all, are hot upon everything, which
offer, [[present]], and give themselves up to every [[occasion]].  we are to use
these accidental and extraneous commodities, so far as they are pleasant
to us, but by no means to lay our principal foundation there; ‘tis no
true one; neither [[nature]] nor [[reason]] allows it so to be.  why therefore
should we, contrary to their laws [[law]], enslave our own contentment to the
power of another?  to anticipate also the accidents of [[fortune]], to
deprive ourselves of the conveniences we have in our own [[power]], as
several have done upon the account of devotion, and some [[philosophers]] by
reasoning; to be one’s own servant, to [[lie]] hard, to put out our own [[eyes]],
to throw our [[wealth]] into the river, to go in search of [[grief]]; these, by
the misery of this [[life]], aiming at bliss in another; those by laying
themselves low to avoid the danger of falling: all such are acts of an
excessive [[virtue]].  the stoutest and most resolute natures [[nature]] render even
their seclusion glorious and exemplary:

                    “tuta et parvula laudo,
          quum res deficiunt, satis inter vilia fortis
          verum, ubi quid melius contingit et unctius, idem
          hos sapere et solos aio bene vivere, quorum
          conspicitur nitidis fundata pecunia villis.”

     [“when means are deficient, i laud a safe and humble condition,
     content with little: but when things grow [[better]] and more easy, i
     all the same say that you alone are [[wise]] and [[live]] well, whose
     invested [[money]] is visible in beautiful villas.”
      --horace, ep., i. 15, 42.]

a [[great]] deal less would serve my turn well enough.  ‘tis enough for me,
under fortune’s favour, to prepare myself for her disgrace, and, being at
my ease, to represent to myself, as far as my [[imagination]] can stretch,
the ill to come; as we do at jousts and tiltings, where we counterfeit
war in the [[greatest]] calm of [[peace]].  i do not [[think]] arcesilaus the
philosopher the less temperate and [[virtuous]] for knowing that he made use
of gold and silver vessels, when the condition of his [[fortune]] allowed him
so to do; i have indeed a [[better]] [[opinion]] of him than if he had denied
himself what he used with liberality and moderation.  i see the utmost
limits of [[natural]] necessity: and considering a [[poor]] [[man]] begging at my
door, ofttimes more jocund and more healthy than i myself am, i put
myself into his place, and attempt to dress my [[mind]] after his mode;
and running, in like manner, over other examples [[example]], though i fancy [[death]],
poverty, contempt, and sickness treading on my heels, i easily resolve
not to be affrighted, forasmuch as a less than i takes them with so much
patience; and am not willing to [[believe]] that a less understanding can do
more than a greater, or that the effects of precept cannot arrive to as
great a height as those of custom.  and knowing of how uncertain duration
these accidental conveniences are, i never forget, in the height of all
my enjoyments, to make it my chiefest prayer to almighty [[god]], that he
will please to render me content with myself and the condition wherein i
am.  i see [[young]] [[men]] very [[gay]] and frolic, who nevertheless keep a mass of
pills in their trunk at [[home]], to take when they’ve got a cold, which they
fear so much the less, because they [[think]] they have remedy at hand.
every one should do in like manner, and, moreover, if they find
themselves [[subject]] to some more [[violent]] disease, should furnish
themselves with such medicines as may numb and stupefy the part.

the employment a [[man]] should choose for such a [[life]] ought neither to be a
laborious nor an unpleasing one; otherwise ‘tis to no [[purpose]] at all to
be retired.  and this depends upon every one’s liking and [[humour]].  mine
has no manner of complacency for husbandry, and such as [[love]] it ought to
apply themselves to it with moderation:

          [“endeavour to make circumstances [[subject]] to me,
          and not me [[subject]] to circumstances.”
           --horace, ep., i. i, 19.]

husbandry is otherwise a very servile employment, as sallust calls it;
though some parts of it are more excusable than the rest, as the [[care]] of
gardens, which xenophon attributes to cyrus; and a mean may be found out
betwixt the sordid and low application, so full of perpetual solicitude,
which is seen in [[men]] who make it their entire [[business]] and study, and the
stupid and extreme negligence, letting all things go at random which we
see in others

                    “democriti pecus edit agellos
          cultaque, dum peregre est animus sine corpore velox.”

     [“democritus’ cattle [[eat]] his corn and spoil his fields, whilst his
     soaring [[mind]] ranges abroad without the [[body]].”
      --horace, ep., i, 12, 12.]

but let us hear what [[advice]] the younger pliny gives his friend caninius
rufus upon the [[subject]] of solitude: “i advise thee, in the full and
plentiful retirement wherein thou art [[arts]], to leave to thy hinds the [[care]] of
thy husbandry, and to addict thyself to the study of letters, to extract
from thence something that may be entirely and absolutely thine own.”  by
which he means [[reputation]]; like cicero, who says that he would employ his
solitude and retirement from [[public]] affairs to acquire by his writings an
immortal [[life]].

                              “usque adeone
          scire tuum, nihil est, nisi to scire hoc, sciat alter?”

          [“is all that thy learning nothing, unless another knows
          that thou knowest?”--persius, sat., i. 23.]

it appears to be [[reason]], when a [[man]] talks of retiring from the [[world]],
that he should look quite out of [for] himself.  these do it but by
halves: they design well enough for themselves when they shall be no more
in it; but still they pretend to extract the fruits of that design from
the [[world]], when absent from it, by a ridiculous contradiction.

the [[imagination]] of those who seek solitude upon the account of devotion,
filling their hopes [[hope]] and [[courage]] with certainty of [[divine]] promises in the
other [[life]], is much more rationally founded.  they propose to themselves
god, an infinite object in goodness and [[power]]; the [[soul]] has there
wherewithal, at full [[liberty]], to satiate her desires [[desire]]: afflictions and
sufferings turn to their advantage, being undergone for the acquisition
of eternal health and joy; [[death]] is to be wished and longed for, where it
is the passage to so [[perfect]] a condition; the asperity of the rules [[rule]] they
impose upon themselves is immediately softened by custom, and all their
carnal appetites baffled and subdued, by refusing to [[humour]] and feed
them, these being only supported by use and exercise.  this sole end of
another happily [[immortal]] [[life]] is that which really merits [[merit]] that we should
abandon the pleasures [[pleasure]] and conveniences of this; and he who can really and
constantly inflame his [[soul]] with the ardour of this vivid [[faith]] and [[hope]],
erects for himself in solitude a more voluptuous and delicious [[life]] than
any other sort of existence.

neither the end, then, nor the means of this [[advice]] pleases me, for we
often fall out of the frying-pan into the [[fire]].--[or: we always relapse
ill from fever into fever.]--this  book-employment is as painful as any
other, and as [[great]] an [[enemy]] to health, which ought to be the first thing
considered; neither ought a [[man]] to be allured with the [[pleasure]] of it,
which is the same that destroys the frugal, the avaricious, the
voluptuous, and the ambitious [[man]].

     [“this plodding occupation of bookes is as painfull as any other,
     and as [[great]] an enemie vnto health, which ought principally to be
     considered.  and a [[man]] should not suffer him selfe to be inveagled
     by the [[pleasure]] he takes in them.”--florio, edit. 1613, p. 122.]

the sages give us caution enough to beware the treachery of our desires [[desire]],
and to distinguish true and entire pleasures [[pleasure]] from such as are mixed and
complicated with greater [[pain]].  for the most of our pleasures [[pleasure]], say they,
wheedle and caress only to strangle us, like those thieves the egyptians
called philistae; if the headache should come before drunkenness, we
should have a [[care]] of drinking too much; but [[pleasure]], to [[deceive]] us,
marches before and conceals her train.  books [[book]] are pleasant, but if, by
being over-studious, we impair our health and spoil our goodhumour, the
best pieces we have, let us give it over; i, for my part, am one of those
who [[think]], that no fruit derived from them can recompense so [[great]] a
loss.  as [[men]] who have long [[felt]] themselves weakened by indisposition,
give themselves up at [[last]] to the [[mercy]] of medicine and submit to certain
rules of living, which they are for the future never to transgress; so he
who retires, weary of and disgusted with the [[common]] way of living, ought
to model this new one he enters into by the rules [[rule]] of [[reason]], and to
institute and establish it by premeditation and reflection.  he ought to
have taken leave of all sorts of [[labour]], what advantage soever it may
promise, and generally to have shaken off all those [[passions]] which
disturb the tranquillity of [[body]] and [[soul]], and then choose the way that
best suits with his own [[humour]]:

               “unusquisque sua noverit ire via.”

in husbandry, study, hunting, and all other exercises, [[men]] are to proceed
to the utmost limits of [[pleasure]], but must take heed of engaging further,
where trouble begins to mix with it.  we are to reserve so much
employment only as is necessary to keep us in breath and to defend us
from the inconveniences that the other extreme of a dull and stupid
laziness brings along with it.  there are sterile knotty sciences [[science]],
chiefly hammered out for the crowd; let such be left to them who are
engaged in the world’s service.  i for my part [[care]] for no other books [[book]],
but either such as are pleasant and easy, to amuse me, or those that
comfort and instruct me how to regulate my [[life]] and [[death]]:

               “tacitum sylvas inter reptare salubres,
               curantem, quidquid dignum sapienti bonoque est.”

     [“silently meditating in the healthy groves, whatever is worthy
     of a [[wise]] and [[good]] [[man]].”--horace, ep., i. 4, 4.]

wiser [[men]], having [[great]] [[force]] and vigour of [[soul]], may propose to
themselves a rest wholly [[spiritual]] but for me, who have a very ordinary
soul, it is very necessary to support myself with bodily conveniences;
and [[age]] having of late deprived me of those pleasures [[pleasure]] that were more
acceptable to me, i instruct and whet my appetite to those that remain,
more suitable to this other [[reason]].  we ought to hold with all our [[force]],
both of hands and teeth, the use of the pleasures [[pleasure]] of [[life]] that our years,
one after another, snatch away from us:

                         “carpamus dulcia; nostrum est,
               quod vivis; cinis, et manes, et fabula fies.”

     [“let us pluck life’s sweets, ‘tis for them we [[live]]: by and by we
     shall be ashes, a ghost, a mere [[subject]] of talk.”
      --persius, sat., v. 151.]

now, as to the end that pliny and cicero propose to us of [[glory]], ‘tis
infinitely wide of my account.  [[ambition]] is of all others the most
contrary [[humour]] to solitude; [[glory]] and repose are things that cannot
possibly inhabit in one and the same place.  for so much as i [[understand]],
these have only their arms and legs disengaged from the crowd; their soul
and intention remain confined behind more than ever:

          “tun’, vetule, auriculis alienis colligis escas?”

     [“dost thou, then, old [[man]], collect food for others’ ears?”
      --persius, sat., i. 22.]

they have only retired to take a [[better]] leap, and by a stronger motion to
give a brisker charge into the crowd.  will you see how they shoot short?
let us put into the counterpoise the [[advice]] of two [[philosophers]], of two
very different sects, writing, the one to idomeneus, the other to
lucilius, their [[friends]], to retire into solitude from worldly honours [[honour]] and
affairs.  “you have,” say they, “hitherto lived swimming and floating;
come now and [[die]] in the harbour: you have given the first part of your
life to the [[light]], give what remains to the shade.  it is impossible to
give over [[business]], if you do not also quit the fruit; therefore
disengage yourselves from all concern of name and [[glory]]; ‘tis to be
feared the lustre of your former actions will give you but too much
light, and [[follow]] you into your most private retreat.  quit with other
pleasures that which proceeds from the approbation of another [[man]]: and as
to your [[knowledge]] and parts, never concern yourselves; they will not lose
their effect if yourselves be the [[better]] for them.  [[remember]] him, who
being [[asked]] why he took so much pains [[pain]] in an art [[arts]] that could come to the
knowledge of but few persons [[person]]?  ‘a few are enough for me,’ replied he;
‘i have enough with one; i have enough with never an one.’--[seneca, ep.,
7.]--he said true; you and a companion are theatre enough to one
another, or you to yourself.  let the [[people]] be to you one, and be you
one to the whole [[people]].  ‘tis an unworthy [[ambition]] to [[think]] to derive
glory from a man’s sloth and privacy: you are to do like the beasts of
chase, who efface the track at the entrance into their den.  you are no
more to concern yourself how the [[world]] talks of you, but how you are to
talk to yourself.  retire yourself into yourself, but first prepare
yourself there to receive yourself: it were a folly to trust yourself in
your own hands, if you cannot govern yourself.  a [[man]] may miscarry alone
as well as in company.  till you have rendered yourself one before whom
you dare not trip, and till you have a bashfulness and [[respect]] for
yourself,

               “obversentur [[species]] honestae animo;”

          [“let honest things be ever [[present]] to the mind”
           --cicero, tusc. quaes., ii. 22.]

present continually to your [[imagination]] cato, phocion, and aristides, in
whose presence the fools [[fool]] themselves will hide their faults [[fault]], and make them
controllers of all your intentions; should these deviate from [[virtue]],
your [[respect]] to those will set you [[right]]; they will keep you in this way
to be contented with yourself; to borrow nothing of any other but
yourself; to stay and fix your [[soul]] in [[certain]] and limited thoughts [[thought]],
wherein she may please herself, and having understood the true and real
goods, which [[men]] the more enjoy the more they [[understand]], to rest
satisfied, without [[desire]] of prolongation of [[life]] or name.”  this is the
precept of the true and [[natural]] [[philosophy]], not of a boasting and prating
philosophy, such as that of the two former.

     they must be very hard to please, if they are not contented
     things that engage us elsewhere and separate us from ourselves
     this decay of [[nature]] which renders him useless, burdensome
     this plodding occupation of bookes is as painfull as any other
     those immodest and debauched tricks and postures

chapter xxxix

a consideration upon cicero

one word more by way of comparison betwixt these two.  there are to be
gathered out of the writings of cicero and the younger pliny (but little,
in my [[opinion]], resembling his uncle in his humours) infinite testimonies
of a beyond measure ambitious [[nature]]; and amongst others, this for one,
that they both, in the sight of all the [[world]], solicit the historians of
their [[time]] not to forget them in their memoirs; and [[fortune]], as if in
spite, has made the vanity of those requests [[live]] upon record down to
this [[age]] of ours, while she has long since consigned the histories
themselves to oblivion.  but this exceeds all meanness of spirit in
persons of such a quality as they were, to [[think]] to derive any great
renown from babbling and prating; even to the publishing of their private
letters to their [[friends]], and so withal, that though some of them were
never sent, the opportunity being lost, they nevertheless presented them
to the [[light]], with this worthy excuse that they were unwilling to lose
their labours [[labour]] and lucubrations.  was it not very well becoming two
consuls of [[rome]], [[sovereign]] magistrates of the [[republic]] that commanded
the [[world]], to spend their leisure in contriving quaint and elegant
missives, thence to gain the [[reputation]] of being versed in their own
mother-tongues?  what could a pitiful schoolmaster have done worse, whose
trade it was thereby to get his living?  if the acts of xenophon and
caesar had not far transcended their eloquence, i scarce [[believe]] they
would ever have taken the pains [[pain]] to have written them; they made it their
business to recommend not their speaking, but their doing.  and could the
perfection of eloquence have added a lustre suitable to a great
personage, certainly scipio and laelius had never resigned the [[honour]] of
their comedies, with all the luxuriances and elegances of the latin
tongue, to an african [[slave]]; for that the [[work]] was theirs, its [[beauty]] and
excellence sufficiently declare; terence himself confesses as much, and i
should take it ill from any one that would dispossess me of that [[belief]].

‘tis a [[kind]] of mockery and offence to extol a [[man]] for qualities
misbecoming his condition, though otherwise commendable in themselves,
but such as ought not, however, to be his [[chief]] talent; as if a man
should commend a [[king]] for being a [[good]] painter, a [[good]] architect, a good
marksman, or a [[good]] runner at the ring: commendations that add no [[honour]],
unless mentioned altogether and in the train of those that are properly
applicable to him, namely, [[justice]] and the [[science]] of governing and
conducting his [[people]] both in [[peace]] and [[war]].  at this rate, agriculture
was an [[honour]] to cyrus, and eloquence and the [[knowledge]] of letters to
charlemagne.  i have in my [[time]] known some, who by writing acquired both
their titles and [[fortune]], disown their apprenticeship, [[corrupt]] their
style, and affect ignorance in so vulgar a quality (which also our nation
holds to be rarely seen in very learned hands), and to seek a reputation
by [[better]] qualities.  demosthenes’ companions in the embassy to philip,
extolling that [[prince]] as handsome, eloquent, and a stout drinker,
demosthenes said that those were commendations more proper for a woman,
an advocate, or a sponge, than for a king’:

                    “imperet bellante prior, jacentem
                    lenis in hostem.”

     [“in the [[fight]], overthrow your [[enemy]], but be merciful to him when
     fallen.--“horace, carm. saec., v. 51.]

‘tis not his profession to [[know]] either how to hunt or to dance well;

               “orabunt causas alii, coelique meatus
               describent radio, et fulgentia sidera dicent;
               hic regere imperio populos sciat.”

     [“let others plead at the bar, or describe the spheres, and point
     out the glittering stars; let this [[man]] learn to [[rule]] the nations.”
      --aeneid, vi. 849.]

plutarch says, moreover, that to appear so excellent in these less
necessary qualities is to [[produce]] witness against a man’s [[self]], that he
has spent his [[time]] and applied his study ill, which ought to have been
employed in the acquisition of more necessary and more useful things.
so that philip, [[king]] of macedon, having heard that [[great]] alexander his
son sing once at a feast to the wonder of the [[best]] musicians there: “art
thou not ashamed,” said he to him, “to sing so well?” and to the same
philip a musician, with whom he was disputing about some things
concerning his art [[arts]]: “heaven forbid, sir,” said he, “that so [[great]] a
misfortune should ever befall you as to [[understand]] these things better
than i.”  a [[king]] should be able to [[answer]] as iphicrates did the orator,
who pressed upon him in his invective after this manner: “and what art
thou that thou bravest it at this rate?  art [[arts]] thou a [[man]] at arms, art [[arts]] thou
an archer, art [[arts]] thou a pikeman?”--“i am none of all this; but i [[know]] how
to command all these.”  and antisthenes took it for an argument of little
value in ismenias that he was commended for playing excellently well upon
a flute.

i [[know]] very well, that when i hear any one dwell upon the [[language]] of my
essays, i had rather a [[great]] deal he would say nothing: ‘tis not so much
to elevate the style as to depress the sense, and so much the more
offensively as they do it obliquely; and yet i am much deceived if many
other writers deliver more worth noting as to the matter, and, how well
or ill soever, if any other writer has sown things much more materials or
at all events more downright, upon his paper than myself.  to bring the
more in, i only muster up the heads; should i annex the sequel, i should
trebly multiply the volume.  and how many stories have i scattered up and
down in this [[book]] that i only touch upon, which, should any one more
curiously search into, they would find matter enough to [[produce]] infinite
essays.  neither those stories nor my quotations always serve simply for
example, [[authority]], or ornament; i do not only regard them for the use i
make of them: they carry sometimes besides what i apply them to, the seed
of a more [[rich]] and a bolder matter, and sometimes, collaterally, a more
delicate sound both to myself who will say no more about it in this
place, and to others who shall be of my [[humour]].

but returning to the speaking [[virtue]]: i find no [[great]] [[choice]] betwixt not
knowing to speak anything but ill, and not knowing to speak anything but
well.

               “non est ornamentum virile concimitas.”

          [“a carefully arranged dress is no manly ornament.”
           --seneca, ep., 115.]

the sages tell us that, as to what concerns [[knowledge]], ‘tis nothing but
philosophy; and as to what concerns effects, nothing but [[virtue]], which is
generally proper to all degrees [[degree]] and to all orders.

there is something like this in these two other [[philosophers]], for they
also promise eternity to the letters they write to their [[friends]]; but
‘tis after another manner, and by accommodating themselves, for a good
end, to the vanity of another; for they write to them that if the concern
of making themselves known to future ages [[age]], and the thirst of [[glory]], do
yet detain them in the management of [[public]] affairs, and make them fear
the solitude and retirement to which they would persuade them, let them
never trouble themselves more about it, forasmuch as they shall have
credit enough with [[posterity]] to ensure them that were there nothing else
but the letters thus written to them, those letters will render their
names as known and famous as their own [[public]] actions could do.  and
besides this difference, these are not idle and empty letters, that
contain nothing but a fine jingle of well-chosen words and delicate
couched phrases, but rather replete and abounding with grand discourses
of [[reason]], by which a [[man]] may render himself not more eloquent, but more
wise, and that instruct us not to speak, but to do well.  away with that
eloquence that enchants us with itself, and not with actual things!
unless you will allow that of cicero to be of so supreme a [[perfection]] as
to form a complete [[body]] of itself.

i shall farther add one story we [[read]] of him to this [[purpose]], wherein his
nature will much more manifestly be laid open to us.  he was to make an
oration in [[public]], and found himself a little straitened for [[time]] to make
himself ready at his ease; when eros, one of his slaves [[slave]], brought him word
that the audience was deferred till the next day, at which he was so
ravished with joy that he enfranchised him for the [[good]] news.

upon this [[subject]] of letters, i will add this more to what has been
already said, that it is a [[kind]] of writing wherein my [[friends]] [[think]] i can
do something; and i am willing to confess i should rather have chosen to
publish my whimsies that way than any other, had i had to whom to write;
but i wanted such a settled intercourse, as i once had, to attract me to
it, to raise my fancy, and to support me.  for to traffic with the wind,
as some others have done, and to forge [[vain]] names to direct my letters
to, in a serious [[subject]], i could never do it but in a [[dream]], being a
sworn [[enemy]] to all manner of falsification.  i should have been more
diligent and more confident had i had a judicious and indulgent friend
whom to address, than thus to expose myself to the various judgments [[judgment]] of a
whole [[people]], and i am deceived if i had not succeeded [[better]].  i have
naturally a humorous and familiar style; but it is a style of my own, not
proper for [[public]] [[business]], but, like the [[language]] i speak, too compact,
irregular, abrupt, and singular; and as to letters of [[ceremony]] that have
no other substance than a fine contexture of courteous words, i am wholly
to seek.  i have neither faculty nor relish for those tedious tenders of
service and affection; i [[believe]] little in them from others, and i should
not [[forgive]] myself should i say to others more than i myself [[believe]].
‘tis, doubtless, very remote from the [[present]] practice; for there never
was so abject and servile prostitution of offers: [[life]], [[soul]], devotion,
adoration, vassal, [[slave]], and i cannot tell what, as now; all which
expressions are so commonly and so indifferently posted to and fro by
every one and to every one, that when they would profess a greater and
more respectful inclination upon more just occasions [[occasion]], they have not
wherewithal to express it.  i mortally hate all air of [[flattery]], which is
the cause that i naturally fall into a shy, rough, and crude way of
speaking, that, to such as do not [[know]] me, may seem a little to relish of
disdain.  i [[honour]] those most to whom i show the least [[honour]], and where
my [[soul]] moves with the [[greatest]] cheerfulness, i easily forget the
ceremonies of look and gesture, and offer myself faintly and bluntly to
them to whom i am the most devoted: methinks they should [[read]] it in my
heart, and that the expression of my words does but injure the [[love]] i
have conceived within.  to welcome, take leave, give thanks, accost,
offer my service, and such verbal formalities as the ceremonious laws [[law]] of
our [[modern]] civility enjoin, i [[know]] no [[man]] so stupidly unprovided of
language as myself; and i have never been employed in writing letters of
favour and recommendation, that he, in whose behalf it was written, did
not [[think]] my mediation cold and imperfect.  the italians are great
printers of letters; i do [[believe]] i have at least an hundred several
volumes of them; of all which those of annibale caro seem to me to be the
best.  if all the paper i have scribbled to the ladies [[lady]] at the [[time]] when
my hand was really prompted by my passion, were now in being, there
might, peradventure, be found a page worthy to be communicated to our
young inamoratos, that are besotted with that fury.  i always write my
letters post-haste--so precipitately, that though i write intolerably
ill, i rather choose to do it myself, than to employ another; for i can
find none able to [[follow]] me: and i never transcribe any.  i have
accustomed the [[great]] ones who [[know]] me to endure my blots and dashes, and
upon paper without fold or margin.  those that cost me the most pains [[pain]],
are the worst; when i once begin to draw it in by head and shoulders,
‘tis a sign that i am not there.  i fall too without premeditation or
design; the first word begets the second, and so to the end of the
chapter.  the letters of this [[age]] consist more in fine edges and prefaces
than in matter.  just as i had rather write two letters than close and
fold up one, and always assign that employment to some other, so, when
the real [[business]] of my letter is dispatched, i would with all my heart
transfer it to another hand to add those long harangues, offers, and
prayers, that we place at the bottom, and should be glad that some new
custom would discharge us of that trouble; as also of superscribing them
with a long legend of qualities and titles, which for [[fear]] of mistakes,
i have often not written at all, and especially to [[men]] of the long robe
and finance; there are so many new offices, such a dispensation and
ordering of titles of [[honour]], that ‘tis hard to set them forth aright
yet, being so dearly bought, they are neither to be altered nor forgotten
without offence.  i find it equally in [[bad]] taste to encumber the fronts
and inscriptions of the books [[book]] we commit to the press with such.




chapter xl

that the relish for [[good]] and [[evil]] depends in [[great]] measure upon the
opinion we have of them

men (says an ancient [[greek]] sentence)--[manual of epictetus, c. 10.]--
are tormented with the opinions [[opinion]] they have of things and not by the things
themselves.  it were a [[great]] [[victory]] obtained for the relief of our
miserable [[human]] condition, could this proposition be established for
certain and true throughout.  for if evils [[evil]] have no admission into us but
by the [[judgment]] we ourselves make of them, it should seem that it is,
then, in our own [[power]] to despise them or to turn them to [[good]].  if
things [[surrender]] themselves to our [[mercy]], why do we not convert and
accommodate them to our advantage?  if what we call [[evil]] and torment is
neither [[evil]] nor torment of itself, but only that our fancy gives it that
quality, it is in us to [[change]] it, and it being in our own [[choice]], if
there be no constraint upon us, we must certainly be very [[strange]] fools
to take arms for that side which is most offensive to us, and to give
sickness, want, and contempt a bitter and nauseous taste, if it be in our
power to give them a pleasant relish, and if, [[fortune]] simply providing
the matter, ‘tis for us to give it the form.  now, that what we call evil
is not so of itself, or at least to that [[degree]] that we make it, and that
it depends upon us to give it another taste and [[complexion]] (for all comes
to one), let us examine how that can be maintained.

if the original being of those things we [[fear]] had [[power]] to lodge itself
in us by its own [[authority]], it would then lodge itself alike, and in like
manner, in all; for [[men]] are all of the same [[kind]], and saving in greater
and less proportions, are all provided with the same utensils and
instruments to conceive and to [[judge]]; but the [[diversity]] of opinions [[opinion]] we
have of those things clearly evidences that they only enter us by
composition; one [[person]], peradventure, admits them in their true being,
but a thousand others give them a new and contrary being in them.  we
hold [[death]], [[poverty]], and [[pain]] for our principal enemies [[enemy]]; now, this [[death]],
which some repute the most dreadful of all dreadful things, who does not
know that others call it the only secure harbour from the storms and
tempests of [[life]], the [[sovereign]] [[good]] of [[nature]], the sole support of
liberty, and the [[common]] and prompt remedy of all evils [[evil]]?  and as the one
expect it with [[fear]] and trembling, the others support it with greater
ease than [[life]].  that one complains of its facility:

          “mors! utinam pavidos vitae subducere nolles.
          sed virtus to sola daret!”

     [“o death! wouldst that thou might spare the [[coward]], but that
     valour alone should [[pay]] thee tribute.”--lucan, iv. 580.]

now, let us leave these boastful courages.  theodorus answered
lysimachus, who threatened to kill him, “thou wilt do a brave feat,” said
he, “to attain the [[force]] of a cantharides.”  the majority of philosophers
are observed to have either purposely anticipated, or hastened and
assisted their own [[death]].  how many ordinary [[people]] do we see [[led]] to
execution, and that not to a simple [[death]], but mixed with shame and
sometimes with grievous torments, appear with such assurance, whether
through firm [[courage]] or [[natural]] simplicity, that a [[man]] can discover no
change from their ordinary condition; settling their domestic affairs,
commending themselves to their [[friends]], singing, preaching, and
addressing the [[people]], nay, sometimes sallying into jests, and drinking
to their companions, quite as well as [[socrates]]?

one that they were leading to the gallows told them they must not take
him through such a street, lest a merchant who lived there should arrest
him by the way for an old debt.  another told the hangman he must not
touch his neck for [[fear]] of making him laugh, he was so ticklish.  another
answered his confessor, who promised him he should that day sup with our
lord, “do you go then,” said he, “in my room [place]; for i for my part
keep fast to-day.”  another having called for drink, and the hangman
having drunk first, said he would not drink after him, for [[fear]] of
catching some [[evil]] disease.  everybody has heard the tale of the picard,
to whom, being upon the ladder, they presented a [[common]] wench, telling
him (as our [[law]] does some times [[time]] permit) that if he would [[marry]] her they
would save his [[life]]; he, having a while considered her and perceiving
that she halted: “come, tie up, tie up,” said he, “she limps.”  and they
tell another story of the same [[kind]] of a fellow in denmark, who being
condemned to lose his head, and the like condition being proposed to him
upon the scaffold, refused it, by [[reason]] the girl they offered him had
hollow cheeks and too sharp a nose.  a servant at toulouse being accused
of heresy, for the sum of his [[belief]] referred himself to that of his
master, a [[young]] student, [[prisoner]] with him, choosing rather to [[die]] than
suffer himself to be persuaded that his master could err.  we [[read]] that
of the inhabitants of arras, when louis xi. took that [[city]], a [[great]] many
let themselves be [[hanged]] rather than they would say, “god save the [[king]].”
 and amongst that mean-souled [[race]] of [[men]], the buffoons, there have been
some who would not leave their fooling at the very moment of [[death]].  one
that the hang [[man]] was turning off the ladder cried:  “launch the galley,”
 an ordinary saying of his.  another, whom at the point of [[death]] his
friends had laid upon a bed of straw before the [[fire]], the physician
asking him where his [[pain]] lay: “betwixt the bench and the [[fire]],” said he,
and the [[priest]], to give him extreme unction, groping for his feet which
his [[pain]] had made him pull up to him: “you will find them,” said he, “at
the end of my legs.”  to one who being [[present]] exhorted him to recommend
himself to [[god]]: “why, who goes thither?”  said he; and the other
replying: “it will presently be yourself, if it be his [[good]] [[pleasure]].”
 “shall i be sure to be there by to-morrow night?” said he.  “do, but
recommend yourself to him,” said the other, “and you will soon be there.”
 “i were [[best]] then,” said he, “to carry my recommendations myself.”

in the [[kingdom]] of narsingah to this day the wives [[wife]] of their priests [[priest]] are
buried alive with the bodies [[body]] of their husbands; all other wives [[wife]] are burnt
at their husbands’ funerals, which they not only firmly but cheerfully
undergo.  at the [[death]] of their [[king]], his wives [[wife]] and concubines, his
favourites, all his officers, and domestic servants, who make up a whole
people, [[present]] themselves so gaily to the [[fire]] where his [[body]] is burnt,
that they seem to take it for a singular [[honour]] to accompany their master
in [[death]].  during our late wars [[war]] of milan, where there happened so many
takings and retakings of towns, the [[people]], impatient of so many changes
of [[fortune]], took such a resolution to [[die]], that i have heard my father
say he there saw a list taken of five-and-twenty masters of families [[family]] who
made themselves away in one week’s [[time]]: an incident somewhat resembling
that of the xanthians, who being besieged by brutus, fell--men, [[women]],
and children--into such a furious appetite of dying, that nothing can be
done to evade [[death]] which they did not to avoid [[life]]; insomuch that
brutus had much difficulty in saving a very small number.--[“only fifty
were saved.”--plutarch, [[life]] of brutus, c. 8.]

every [[opinion]] is of [[force]] enough to cause itself to be espoused at the
expense of [[life]].  the first article of that valiant oath that greece took
and observed in the median [[war]], was that every one should sooner exchange
life for [[death]], than their own laws [[law]] for those of [[persia]].  what a [[world]] of
people do we see in the wars [[war]] betwixt the turks and the greeks [[greek]], rather
embrace a cruel [[death]] than uncircumcise themselves to admit of baptism?
an [[example]] of which no sort of [[religion]] is incapable.

the kings [[king]] of castile having [[banished]] the [[jews]] out of their dominions,
john, [[king]] of portugal, in consideration of eight crowns [[crown]] a head, sold
them a retreat into his for a [[certain]] limited [[time]], upon condition that
the [[time]] fixed coming to expire they should begone, and he to furnish
them with shipping to transport them into [[africa]].  the day comes, which
once lapsed they were given to [[understand]] that such as were afterward
found in the [[kingdom]] should remain slaves [[slave]]; vessels were very slenderly
provided; and those who embarked in them were rudely and villainously
used by the passengers, who, besides other indignities, kept them
cruising upon the sea, one while forwards and another backwards, till
they had spent all their provisions, and were constrained to buy of them
at so dear a rate and so long withal, that they set them not on shore
till they were all stripped to the very shirts.  the news of this inhuman
usage being brought to those who remained behind, the greater part of
them resolved upon [[slavery]] and some made a show of changing [[religion]].
emmanuel, the successor of john, being come to the [[crown]], first set them
at [[liberty]], and afterwards altering his [[mind]], ordered them to depart his
country, assigning three ports for their passage.  he hoped, says bishop
osorius, no contemptible latin historian of these later times [[time]], that the
favour of the [[liberty]] he had given them having failed of converting them
to [[christianity]], yet the difficulty of committing themselves to the mercy
of the mariners and of abandoning a [[country]] they were now habituated to
and were grown very [[rich]] in, to go and expose themselves in [[strange]] and
unknown regions, would certainly do it.  but finding himself deceived in
his expectation, and that they were all resolved upon the [[voyage]], he cut
off two of the three ports he had promised them, to the end that the
length and incommodity of the passage might reduce some, or that he might
have opportunity, by crowding them all into one place, the more
conveniently to execute what he had designed, which was to [[force]] all the
children under fourteen years of [[age]] from the arms of their fathers [[father]] and
mothers, to transport them from their sight and conversation, into a
place where they might be instructed and brought up in our [[religion]].  he
says that this produced a most horrid spectacle the [[natural]] affection
betwixt the parents and their [[children]], and moreover their zeal to their
ancient [[belief]], contending against this [[violent]] decree, fathers [[father]] and
mothers were commonly seen making themselves away, and by a yet much more
rigorous [[example]], precipitating out of [[love]] and compassion their young
children into wells and pits, to avoid the severity of this [[law]].  as to
the remainder of them, the [[time]] that had been prefixed being expired,
for want of means to transport them they again returned into [[slavery]].
some also turned christians [[christian]], upon whose [[faith]], as also that of their
posterity, even to this day, which is a hundred years since, few
portuguese can yet rely; though custom and length of [[time]] are much more
powerful counsellors in such changes [[change]] than all other constraints whatever.
in the town of castelnaudari, fifty heretic albigeois at one time
suffered themselves to be burned alive in one [[fire]] rather than they would
renounce their opinions [[opinion]].

     “quoties non modo ductores nostri, sed universi etiam exercitus,
     ad non dubiam mortem concurrerunt?”

     [“how often have not only our leaders, but whole armies [[army]], run to a
     [[certain]] and manifest [[death]].”--cicero, tusc. quaes., i. 37.]

i have seen an intimate friend of mine run headlong upon [[death]] with a
real affection, and that was rooted in his [[heart]] by divers plausible
arguments which he would never permit me to dispossess him of, and upon
the first honourable [[occasion]] that offered itself to him, precipitate
himself into it, without any manner of visible [[reason]], with an obstinate
and ardent [[desire]] of dying.  we have several examples [[example]] in our own times [[time]] of
persons, even [[young]] [[children]], who for [[fear]] of some little inconvenience
have despatched themselves.  and what shall we not [[fear]], says one of the
ancients--[seneca, ep., 70.]--to this [[purpose]], if we dread that which
cowardice itself has chosen for its refuge?

should i here [[produce]] a long catalogue of those, of all sexes [[sex]] and
conditions and sects, even in the most [[happy]] ages [[age]], who have either with
great constancy looked [[death]] in the face, or voluntarily sought it, and
sought it not only to avoid the evils [[evil]] of this [[life]], but some purely to
avoid the satiety of living, and others for the [[hope]] of a better
condition elsewhere, i should never have done.  nay, the number is so
infinite that in [[truth]] i should have a [[better]] bargain on’t to reckon up
those who have feared it.  this one therefore shall serve for all:
pyrrho the philosopher being one day in a boat in a very [[great]] tempest,
shewed to those he saw the most affrighted about him, and encouraged
them, by the [[example]] of a hog that was there, nothing at all concerned at
the storm.  shall we then dare to say that this advantage of [[reason]], of
which we so much boast, and upon the account of which we [[think]] ourselves
masters and emperors [[emperor]] over the rest of all creation, was given us for a
torment?  to what end serves the [[knowledge]] of things if it renders us
more unmanly? if we thereby lose the tranquillity and repose we should
enjoy without it? and if it put us into a worse condition than pyrrho’s
hog?  shall we employ the understanding that was conferred upon us for
our [[greatest]] [[good]] to our own ruin; setting ourselves against the design
of [[nature]] and the universal order of things, which intend that every one
should make use of the faculties, members, and means he has to his own
best advantage?

but it may, peradventure, be objected against me: your [[rule]] is true
enough as to what concerns [[death]]; but what will you say of indigence?
what will you, moreover, say of [[pain]], which aristippus, hieronimus, and
most of the sages have reputed the worst of evils [[evil]]; and those who have
denied it by word of mouth have, however, confessed it in effect?
posidonius being extremely tormented with a sharp and painful disease,
pompeius came to visit him, excusing himself that he had taken so
unseasonable a [[time]] to come to hear him discourse of [[philosophy]].
“the gods forbid,” said posidonius to him, “that [[pain]] should ever have
the [[power]] to hinder me from talking,” and thereupon fell immediately upon
a discourse of the contempt of [[pain]]: but, in the meantime, his own
infirmity was playing his part, and plagued him to [[purpose]]; to which he
cried out, “thou mayest [[work]] thy will, [[pain]], and torment me with all the
power thou hast, but thou shalt never make me say that thou art [[arts]] an [[evil]].”
 this story that they make such a clutter withal, what has it to do,
i fain would [[know]], with the contempt of [[pain]]?  he only fights it with
words, and in the meantime, if the shootings and dolours he [[felt]] did not
move him, why did he interrupt his discourse?  why did he fancy he did so
great a thing in forbearing to confess it an [[evil]]?  all does not here
consist in the [[imagination]]; our fancies may [[work]] upon other things: but
here is the [[certain]] [[science]] that is playing its part, of which our senses
themselves are judges [[judge]]:

          “qui nisi sunt veri, ratio quoque falsa sit omnis.”

     [“which, if they be not true, all reasoning may also be false.
     --“lucretius, iv. 486.]

shall we persuade our skins that the jerks of a whip agreeably tickle us,
or our taste that a potion of aloes is vin de graves?  pyrrho’s hog is
here in the same predicament with us; he is not afraid of [[death]], ‘tis
true, but if you beat him he will cry out to some [[purpose]].  shall we
force the general [[law]] of [[nature]], which in every living creature under
heaven is seen to tremble under [[pain]]?  the very trees seem to groan under
the blows they receive.  [[death]] is only [[felt]] by [[reason]], forasmuch as it is
the motion of an instant;

         “aut fuit, aut veniet; nihil est praesentis in illa.”

     [“death has been, or will come: there is nothing of the [[present]] in
     it.”--estienne de la boetie, satires.]

          “morsque minus poenae, quam mora mortis, habet;”

     [“the delay of [[death]] is more painful than [[death]] itself.”
      --ovid, ep. ariadne to theseus, v. 42.]

a thousand beasts, a thousand [[men]], are sooner [[dead]] than threatened.  that
also which we principally pretend to [[fear]] in [[death]] is [[pain]], its ordinary
forerunner: yet, if we may [[believe]] a holy [[father]]:

          “malam mortem non facit, nisi quod sequitur mortem.”

          [“that which follows [[death]] makes [[death]] [[bad]].”
           --st. augustin, de civit. dei, i. ii.]

and i should yet say, more probably, that neither that which goes before
nor that which follows after is at all of the appurtenances of [[death]].

we excuse ourselves falsely: and i find by [[experience]] that it is rather
the [[impatience]] of the [[imagination]] of [[death]] that makes us impatient of
pain, and that we find it doubly grievous as it threatens us with [[death]].
but [[reason]] accusing our cowardice for fearing a thing so sudden, so
inevitable, and so insensible, we take the other as the more excusable
pretence.  all ills that carry no other danger along with them but simply
the evils [[evil]] themselves, we treat as things of no danger: the toothache or
the gout, painful as they are, yet being not reputed mortal, who reckons
them in the catalogue of diseases?

but let us presuppose that in [[death]] we principally regard the [[pain]]; as
also there is nothing to be feared in [[poverty]] but the miseries it brings
along with it of thirst, [[hunger]], cold, heat, watching, and the other
inconveniences it makes us suffer, still we have nothing to do with
anything but [[pain]].  i will grant, and very willingly, that it is the
worst incident of our being (for i am the [[man]] upon [[earth]] who the most
hates and avoids it, considering that hitherto, i thank [[god]], i have had
so little traffic with it), but still it is in us, if not to annihilate,
at least to lessen it by patience; and though the [[body]] and the reason
should mutiny, to maintain the [[soul]], nevertheless, in [[good]] condition.
were it not so, who had ever given [[reputation]] to [[virtue]]; valour, [[force]],
magnanimity, and resolution?  where were their parts to be played if
there were no [[pain]] to be defied?

               “avida est periculi virtus.”

     [“courage is greedy of danger.”--seneca, de providentia, c. 4]

were there no lying upon the hard ground, no enduring, armed at all
points, the meridional heats, no feeding upon the flesh of horses and
asses, no seeing a man’s [[self]] hacked and hewed to pieces, no suffering a
bullet to be pulled out from amongst the shattered bones, no sewing up,
cauterising and searching of wounds, by what means were the advantage we
covet to have over the vulgar to be acquired?  ‘tis far from flying evil
and [[pain]], what the sages say, that of actions equally [[good]], a [[man]] should
most covet to perform that wherein there is greater [[labour]] and [[pain]].

          “non est enim hilaritate, nec lascivia, nec risu, aut joco
          comite levitatis, sed saepe etiam tristes firmitate et
          constantia sunt beati.”

     [“for [[men]] are not only [[happy]] by mirth and wantonness, by laughter
     and jesting, the companion of levity, but ofttimes the serious sort
     reap felicity from their firmness and constancy.”
      --cicero, de finib. ii. 10.]

and for this [[reason]] it has ever been impossible to persuade our
forefathers but that the victories [[victory]] obtained by dint of [[force]] and the
hazard of [[war]] were not more honourable than those performed in great
security by stratagem or practice:

          “laetius est, quoties magno sibi constat honestum.”

     [“a [[good]] deed is all the more a satisfaction by how much the more
     it has cost us”--lucan, ix. 404.]

besides, this ought to be our comfort, that naturally, if the [[pain]] be
violent, ‘tis but short; and if long, nothing [[violent]]:

                        “si gravis, brevis;
                         si longus, levis.”

thou wilt not [[feel]] it long if thou feelest it too much; it will either
put an end to itself or to thee; it comes to the same thing; if thou
canst not support it, it will export thee:

     [“remember that the [[greatest]] pains [[pain]] are terminated by [[death]]; that
     slighter pains [[pain]] have long intermissions of repose, and that we are
     masters of the more moderate sort: so that, if they be tolerable,
     we bear them; if not, we can go out of [[life]], as from a theatre, when
     it does not please us”--cicero, de finib. i. 15.]

that which makes us suffer [[pain]] with so much [[impatience]] is the not being
accustomed to repose our chiefest contentment in the [[soul]]; that we do not
enough rely upon her who is the sole and [[sovereign]] mistress of our
condition.  the [[body]], saving in the greater or less proportion, has but
one and the same bent and bias; whereas the [[soul]] is variable into all
sorts of forms; and [[subject]] to herself and to her own [[empire]], all things
whatsoever, both the senses of the [[body]] and all other accidents: and
therefore it is that we ought to study her, to inquire into her, and to
rouse up all her powerful faculties.  there is neither [[reason]], [[force]], nor
prescription that can anything prevail against her inclination and
choice.  of so many thousands of biases that she has at her disposal, let
us give her one proper to our repose and conversation, and then we shall
not only be sheltered and secured from all manner of injury and offence,
but moreover gratified and obliged, if she will, with evils [[evil]] and offences.
she makes her [[profit]] indifferently of all things; error, dreams [[dream]], serve
her to [[good]] use, as [[loyal]] matter to lodge us in safety and contentment.
‘tis plain enough to be seen that ‘tis the sharpness of our [[mind]] that
gives the edge to our pains [[pain]] and pleasures [[pleasure]]: beasts that have no such
thing, leave to their bodies [[body]] their own [[free]] and [[natural]] sentiments, and
consequently in every [[kind]] very near the same, as appears by the
resembling application of their motions.  if we would not disturb in our
members the jurisdiction that appertains to them in this, ‘tis to be
believed it would be the [[better]] for us, and that [[nature]] has given them a
just and moderate temper both to [[pleasure]] and [[pain]]; neither can it fail
of being just, being [[equal]] and [[common]].  but seeing we have enfranchised
ourselves from her rules [[rule]] to give ourselves up to the rambling [[liberty]] of
our own fancies, let us at least [[help]] to incline them to the most
agreeable side.  [[plato]] fears [[fear]] our too vehemently engaging ourselves with
pain and [[pleasure]], forasmuch as these too much knit and ally the [[soul]] to
the [[body]]; whereas i rather, quite contrary, by [[reason]] it too much
separates and disunites them.  as an [[enemy]] is made more fierce by our
flight, so [[pain]] grows proud to see us truckle under her.  she will
surrender upon much [[better]] terms to them who make head against her: a man
must oppose and stoutly set himself against her.  in retiring and giving
ground, we invite and pull upon ourselves the ruin that threatens us.  as
the [[body]] is more firm in an encounter, the more stiffly and obstinately
it applies itself to it, so is it with the [[soul]].

but let us come to examples [[example]], which are the proper game of folks of such
feeble [[force]] as myself; where we shall find that it is with [[pain]] as with
stones, that receive a brighter or a duller lustre according to the foil
they are set in, and that it has no more room in us than we are pleased
to allow it:

          “tantum doluerunt, quantum doloribus se inseruerunt.”

     [“they [[suffered]] so much the more, by how much more they gave way to
     suffering.”--st. augustin, de civit. dei, i. 10.]

we are more sensible of one little touch of a surgeon’s lancet than of
twenty wounds with a [[sword]] in the heat of [[fight]].  the pains [[pain]] of
childbearing, said by the physicians and by [[god]] himself to be [[great]], and
which we pass through with so many ceremonies--there are whole nations
that make nothing of them.  i set aside the lacedaemonian [[women]], but what
else do you find in the swiss among our foot-soldiers, if not that, as
they trot after their husbands, you see them to-day carry the child at
their necks that they carried yesterday in their bellies?  the
counterfeit [[egyptians]] we have amongst us go themselves to wash theirs,
so soon as they come into the [[world]], and bathe in the first river they
meet.  besides so many wenches as daily drop their [[children]] by stealth,
as they conceived them, that [[fair]] and [[noble]] [[wife]] of sabinus, a patrician
of [[rome]], for another’s interest, endured alone, without [[help]], without
crying out, or so much as a groan, the bearing of twins.--[plutarch, on
love, c.  34.]--a [[poor]] simple boy of lacedaemon having stolen a fox (for
they more [[fear]] the shame of stupidity in stealing than we do the
punishment of the knavery), and having got it under his coat, rather
endured the tearing out of his bowels than he would discover his theft.
and another offering incense at a [[sacrifice]], [[suffered]] himself to be
burned to the bone by a coal that fell into his sleeve, rather than
disturb the [[ceremony]].  and there have been a [[great]] number, for a sole
trial of [[virtue]], following their [[institutions]], who have at seven years
old endured to be whipped to [[death]] without changing their countenance.
and cicero has seen them [[fight]] in parties, with fists, feet, and teeth,
till they have fainted and sunk down, rather than confess themselves
overcome:

     [“custom could never conquer [[nature]]; she is ever invincible; but we
     have infected the [[mind]] with shadows, delights, negligence, sloth;
     we have grown effeminate through opinions [[opinion]] and [[corrupt]] morality.”
      --cicero, tusc. quaes., v. 27.]

every one knows [[know]] the story of scaevola, that having slipped into the
enemy’s camp to kill their general, and having missed his blow, to repair
his [[fault]], by a more [[strange]] invention and to deliver his [[country]], he
boldly confessed to porsenna, who was the [[king]] he had a [[purpose]] to kill,
not only his design, but moreover added that there were then in the camp
a [[great]] number of romans, his accomplices in the enterprise, as [[good]] men
as he; and to show what a one he himself was, having caused a pan of
burning coals to be brought, he saw and endured his arm to broil and
roast, till the [[king]] himself, conceiving [[horror]] at the sight, commanded
the pan to be taken away.  what would you say of him that would not
vouchsafe to respite his reading in a [[book]] whilst he was under incision?
and of the other that persisted to mock and laugh in contempt of the
pains inflicted upon him; so that the provoked [[cruelty]] of the
executioners that had him in handling, and all the inventions of tortures
redoubled upon him, one after another, spent in [[vain]], gave him the
bucklers?  but he was a philosopher.  but what! a gladiator of caesar’s
endured, laughing all the while, his wounds to be searched, lanced, and
laid open:

     [“what ordinary gladiator ever groaned?  which of them ever changed
     countenance?  which of them not only stood or fell indecorously?
     which, when he had fallen and was commanded to receive the stroke of
     the [[sword]], contracted his neck.”--cicero, tusc. quaes., ii. 17.]


let us bring in the [[women]] too.  who has not heard at [[paris]] of her that
caused her face to be flayed only for the fresher [[complexion]] of a new
skin?  there are who have drawn [[good]] and sound teeth to make their voices
more soft and sweet, or to place the other teeth in [[better]] order.  how
many examples [[example]] of the contempt of [[pain]] have we in that [[sex]]?  what can they
not do, what do they [[fear]] to do, for never so little [[hope]] of an addition
to their [[beauty]]?

               “vallere queis cura est albos a stirpe capillos,
               et faciem, dempta pelle, referre novam.”

     [“who carefully pluck out their grey hairs by the roots, and renew
     their faces by peeling off the old skin.”--tibullus, i. 8, 45.]

i have seen some of them swallow sand, ashes, and do their utmost to
destroy their stomachs to get pale complexions.  to make a fine spanish
body, what racks will they not endure of girding and bracing, till they
have notches in their sides cut into the very quick, and sometimes to
death?

it is an ordinary thing with several nations at this day to wound
themselves in [[good]] earnest to gain credit to what they profess; of which
our [[king]], relates notable examples [[example]] of what he has seen in poland and done
towards himself.--[henry iii.]--but besides this, which i [[know]] to have
been imitated by some in [[france]], when i came from that famous assembly of
the estates at blois, i had a little before seen a maid in picardy, who
to manifest the ardour of her promises, as also her constancy, give
herself, with a bodkin she wore in her hair, four or five [[good]] lusty
stabs in the arm, till the [[blood]] gushed out to some [[purpose]].  the turks
give themselves [[great]] scars in [[honour]] of their mistresses, and to the end
they may the longer remain, they presently clap [[fire]] to the wound, where
they hold it an incredible [[time]] to stop the [[blood]] and form the cicatrice;
people that have been eyewitnesses of it have both written and sworn it
to me.  but for ten aspers--[a turkish coin worth about a penny]--there
are there every day fellows to be found that will give themselves a good
deep slash in the arms or thighs.  i am willing, however, to have the
testimonies nearest to us when we have most need of them; for christendom
furnishes us with enough.  after the [[example]] of our blessed guide there
have been many who have crucified themselves.  we learn by testimony very
worthy of [[belief]], that [[king]] st. louis wore a hair-shirt till in his old
age his confessor gave him a dispensation to leave it off; and that every
friday he caused his shoulders to be drubbed by his [[priest]] with five
small chains of iron which were always carried about amongst his night
accoutrements for that [[purpose]].

william, our [[last]] duke of guienne, the [[father]] of that eleanor who
transmitted that duchy to the houses of [[france]] and [[england]], continually
for the [[last]] ten or twelve years of his [[life]] wore a suit of armour under
a [[religious]] habit by way of penance.  foulke, count of anjou, went as far
as [[jerusalem]], there to cause himself to be whipped by two of his
servants, with a rope about his neck, before the sepulchre of our [[lord]].
but do we not, moreover, every [[good]] friday, in various places, see great
numbers of [[men]] and [[women]] beat and whip themselves till they lacerate and
cut the flesh to the very bones?  i have often seen it, and ‘tis without
any enchantment; and it was said there were some amongst them (for they
go disguised) who for [[money]] undertook by this means to save harmless the
religion of others, by a contempt of [[pain]], so much the greater, as the
incentives of devotion are more effectual than those of avarice.
q. maximus buried his [[son]] when he was a consul, and m. cato his when
praetor elect, and l. paulus both his, within a few days one after
another, with such a countenance as expressed no manner of [[grief]].  i said
once merrily of a [[certain]] [[person]], that he had disappointed the divine
justice; for the [[violent]] [[death]] of three grown-up [[children]] of his being
one day sent him, for a severe scourge, as it is to be supposed, he was
so far from being afflicted at the accident, that he rather took it for a
particular grace and favour of [[heaven]].  i do not [[follow]] these monstrous
humours, though i lost two or three at nurse, if not without [[grief]], at
least without repining, and yet there is hardly any accident that pierces
nearer to the quick.  i see a [[great]] many other occasions [[occasion]] of [[sorrow]], that
should they happen to me i should hardly [[feel]]; and have despised some,
when they have befallen me, to which the [[world]] has given so terrible a
figure that i should blush to boast of my constancy:

         “ex quo intelligitur, non in natura, sed in opinione,
          esse aegritudinem.”

     [“by which one may [[understand]] that [[grief]] is not in [[nature]], but in
     [[opinion]].”--cicero, tusc. quaes., iii. 28.]

opinion is a powerful party, bold, and without measure.  who ever so
greedily hunted after security and repose as alexander and caesar did
after disturbance and difficulties?  teres, the [[father]] of sitalces, was
wont to say that “when he had no wars [[war]], he fancied there was no difference
betwixt him and his groom.”  cato the consul, to secure some cities [[city]] of
spain from revolt, only interdicting the inhabitants from wearing arms, a
great many killed themselves:

          “ferox gens, nullam vitam rati sine armis esse.”

     [“a fierce [[people]], who [[thought]] there was no [[life]] without [[war]].”
      --livy, xxxiv. 17.]

how many do we [[know]] who have forsaken the calm and sweetness of a quiet
life at [[home]] amongst their acquaintance, to seek out the [[horror]] of
unhabitable deserts; and having precipitated themselves into so abject a
condition as to become the scorn and contempt of the [[world]], have hugged
themselves with the conceit, even to affectation.  cardinal borromeo, who
died lately at milan, amidst all the jollity that the air of [[italy]], his
youth, birth, and [[great]] riches [[rich]], invited him to, kept himself in so
austere a way of living, that the same robe he wore in summer served him
for winter too; he had only straw for his bed, and his hours of leisure
from affairs he continually spent in study upon his knees, having a
little bread and a glass of water set by his [[book]], which was all the
provision of his repast, and all the [[time]] he spent in eating.

i [[know]] some who consentingly have acquired both [[profit]] and advancement
from cuckoldom, of which the bare name only affrights so many [[people]].

if the sight be not the most necessary of all our senses, ‘tis at least
the most pleasant; but the most pleasant and most useful of all our
members seem to be those of [[generation]]; and yet a [[great]] many have
conceived a mortal [[hatred]] against them only for this, that they were too
pleasant, and have deprived themselves of them only for their value:
as much [[thought]] he of his [[eyes]] that put them out.  the generality and
more solid sort of [[men]] look upon abundance of [[children]] as a great
blessing; i, and some others, [[think]] it as [[great]] a benefit to be without
them.  and when you ask thales why he does not [[marry]], he tells you,
because he has no [[mind]] to leave any [[posterity]] behind him.

that our [[opinion]] gives the value to things is very manifest in the great
number of those which we do, not so much prizing them, as ourselves, and
never considering either their virtues [[virtue]] or their use, but only how dear
they cost us, as though that were a part of their substance; and we only
repute for value in them, not what they bring to us, but what we add to
them.  by which i [[understand]] that we are [[great]] economisers of our
expense: as it weighs, it serves for so much as it weighs.  our opinion
will never suffer it to want of its value: the price gives value to the
diamond; difficulty to [[virtue]]; suffering to devotion; and griping to
physic.  a [[certain]] [[person]], to be [[poor]], threw his crowns [[crown]] into the same sea
to which so many come, in all parts of the [[world]], to fish for riches [[rich]].
epicurus says  that to be [[rich]] is no relief, but only an alteration, of
affairs.  in [[truth]], it is not want, but rather abundance, that creates
avarice.  i will deliver my own [[experience]] concerning this affair.

i have since my emergence from [[childhood]] lived in three sorts of
conditions.  the first, which continued for some twenty years, i passed
over without any other means but what were casual and depending upon the
allowance and assistance of others, without stint, but without certain
revenue.  i then spent my [[money]] so much the more cheerfully, and with so
much the less [[care]] how it went, as it wholly depended upon my
overconfidence of [[fortune]].  i never lived more at my ease; i never had
the repulse of finding the purse of any of my [[friends]] shut against me,
having enjoined myself this necessity above all other necessities
whatever, by no means to fail of payment at the appointed [[time]], which
also they have a thousand times [[time]] respited, seeing how careful i was to
satisfy them; so that i practised at once a thrifty, and withal a [[kind]] of
alluring, honesty.  i naturally [[feel]] a [[kind]] of [[pleasure]] in paying, as if
i eased my shoulders of a troublesome weight and freed myself from an
image of [[slavery]]; as also that i find a ravishing [[kind]] of satisfaction in
pleasing another and doing a just action.  i except payments where the
trouble of bargaining and reckoning is required; and in such cases; where
i can meet with nobody to ease me of that charge, i delay them, how
scandalously and injuriously soever, all i possibly can, for [[fear]] of the
wranglings for which both my [[humour]] and way of speaking are so totally
improper and unfit.  there is nothing i hate so much as driving a
bargain; ‘tis a mere traffic of cozenage and impudence, where, after an
hour’s cheapening and hesitating, both parties abandon their word and
oath for five sols’ abatement.  yet i always borrowed at great
disadvantage; for, wanting the confidence to speak to the [[person]] myself,
i committed my request to the persuasion of a letter, which usually is no
very successful advocate, and is of very [[great]] advantage to him who has a
mind to deny.  i, in those days, more jocundly and freely referred the
conduct of my affairs to the stars, than i have since done to my own
providence and [[judgment]].  most [[good]] managers look upon it as a horrible
thing to [[live]] always thus in uncertainty, and do not consider, in the
first place, that the [[greatest]] part of the [[world]] [[live]] so: how many worthy
men have wholly abandoned their own certainties, and yet daily do it, to
the winds, to trust to the inconstant favour of princes [[prince]] and of [[fortune]]?
caesar ran above a million of gold, more than he was worth, in debt to
become caesar; and how many merchants have begun their traffic by the
sale of their farms, which they sent into the indies,

                    “tot per impotentia freta.”

     [“through so many ungovernable seas.”--catullus, iv. 18.]

in so [[great]] a siccity of devotion as we see in these days, we have a
thousand and a thousand colleges that pass it over commodiously enough,
expecting every day their dinner from the liberality of [[heaven]].
secondly, they do not take notice that this certitude upon which they so
much rely is not much less uncertain and hazardous than hazard itself.
i see misery as near beyond two thousand crowns [[crown]] a year as if it stood
close by me; for besides that it is in the [[power]] of [[chance]] to make a
hundred breaches to [[poverty]] through the [[greatest]] [[strength]] of our riches
--there being very often no mean betwixt the highest and the lowest
fortune:

          “fortuna vitrea est: turn, quum splendet, frangitur,”

     [“fortune is glass: in its [[greatest]] brightness it breaks.”
      --ex mim. p. syrus.]

and to turn all our barricadoes and bulwarks topsy-turvy, i find that, by
divers causes, indigence is as frequently seen to inhabit with those who
have estates as with those that have none; and that, peradventure, it is
then far less grievous when alone than when accompanied with riches [[rich]].
these flow more from [[good]] management than from [[revenue]];

               “faber est suae quisque fortunae”

          [“every one is the maker of his own [[fortune]].”
           --sallust, de repub.  ord., i. i.]

and an uneasy, necessitous, busy, [[rich]] [[man]] seems to me more miserable
than he that is simply [[poor]].

     “in divitiis mopes, quod genus egestatis gravissimum est.”

     [“poor in the midst of riches [[rich]], which is the sorest [[kind]] of [[poverty]].”
      --seneca, ep., 74.]

the [[greatest]] and most wealthy princes [[prince]] are by [[poverty]] and want driven to
the most extreme necessity; for can there be any more extreme than to
become tyrants [[tyrant]] and [[unjust]] usurpers of their subjects’ goods [[good]] and estates?

my second condition of [[life]] was to have [[money]] of my own, wherein i so
ordered the matter that i had soon laid up a very notable sum out of a
mean [[fortune]], considering with myself that that only was to be reputed
having which a [[man]] reserves from his ordinary expense, and that a man
cannot absolutely rely upon [[revenue]] he hopes [[hope]] to receive, how clear soever
the [[hope]] may be.  for what, said i, if i should be surprised by such or
such an accident?  and after such-like [[vain]] and vicious imaginations [[imagination]],
would very learnedly, by this hoarding of [[money]], provide against all
inconveniences; and could, moreover, [[answer]] such as objected to me that
the number of these was too infinite, that if i could not lay up for all,
i could, however, do it at least for some and for many.  yet was not this
done without a [[great]] deal of solicitude and [[anxiety]] of [[mind]]; i kept it
very close, and though i dare talk so boldly of myself, never spoke of my
money, but falsely, as others do, who being [[rich]], pretend to be [[poor]], and
being [[poor]], pretend to be [[rich]], dispensing their consciences from ever
telling sincerely what they have: a ridiculous and shameful prudence.
was i going a [[journey]]?  methought i was never enough provided: and the
more i loaded myself with [[money]], the more also was i loaded with [[fear]],
one while of the danger of the roads, another of the fidelity of him who
had the charge of my baggage, of whom, as some others that i [[know]], i was
never sufficiently secure if i had him not always in my eye.  if i
chanced to leave my cash-box behind me, o, what [[strange]] suspicions and
anxiety of [[mind]] did i enter into, and, which was worse, without daring to
acquaint anybody with it.  my [[mind]] was eternally taken up with such
things as these, so that, all things considered, there is more trouble in
keeping [[money]] than in getting it.  and if i did not altogether so much as
i say, or was not really so scandalously solicitous of my [[money]] as i have
made myself out to be, yet it cost me something at least to restrain
myself from being so.  i reaped little or no advantage by what i had, and
my expenses seemed nothing less to me for having the more to spend; for,
as bion said, the hairy [[men]] are as angry as the bald to be pulled; and
after you are once accustomed to it and have once set your [[heart]] upon
your heap, it is no more at your service; you cannot find in your heart
to break it: ‘tis a building that you will fancy must of necessity all
tumble down to ruin if you stir but the least pebble; necessity must
first take you by the throat before you can prevail upon yourself to
touch it; and i would sooner have pawned anything i had, or sold a horse,
and with much less constraint upon myself, than have made the least
breach in that beloved purse i had so carefully laid by.  but the danger
was that a [[man]] cannot easily prescribe [[certain]] limits to this desire
(they are hard to find in things that a [[man]] conceives to be good), and to
stint this [[good]] husbandry so that it may not degenerate into avarice: men
still are intent upon adding to the heap and increasing the stock from
sum to sum, till at [[last]] they vilely deprive themselves of the enjoyment
of their own proper goods [[good]], and throw all into reserve, without making any
use of them at all.  according to this [[rule]], they are the richest people
in the [[world]] who are set to guard the walls and gates of a wealthy [[city]].
all moneyed [[men]] i conclude to be covetous.  [[plato]] places corporal or
human goods [[good]] in this order: health, [[beauty]], [[strength]], riches [[rich]]; and riches [[rich]],
says he, are not blind, but very clear-sighted, when illuminated by
prudence.  dionysius the [[son]] did a very handsome act upon this [[subject]];
he was informed that one of the syracusans had hid a treasure in the
earth, and thereupon sent to the [[man]] to bring it to him, which he
accordingly did, privately reserving a small part of it only to himself,
with which he went to another [[city]], where being cured of his appetite of
hoarding, he began to [[live]] at a more liberal rate; which dionysius
hearing, caused the rest of his treasure to be restored to him, saying,
that since he had learned to use it, he very willingly returned it back
to him.

i continued some years in this hoarding [[humour]], when i [[know]] not what good
demon fortunately put me out of it, as he did the syracusan, and made me
throw abroad all my reserve at random, the [[pleasure]] of a [[certain]] journey
i took at very [[great]] expense having made me spurn this fond [[love]] of money
underfoot; by which means i am now fallen into a third way of living (i
speak what i [[think]] of it), doubtless much more pleasant and regular,
which is, that i [[live]] at the height of my [[revenue]]; sometimes the one,
sometimes the other may perhaps exceed, but ‘tis very little and but
rarely that they differ.  i [[live]] from hand to mouth, and content myself
in having sufficient for my [[present]] and ordinary expense; for as to
extraordinary occasions [[occasion]], all the laying up in the [[world]] would never
suffice.  and ‘tis the [[greatest]] folly imaginable to expect that fortune
should ever sufficiently arm us against herself; ‘tis with our own arms
that we are to [[fight]] her; accidental ones will betray us in the pinch of
the [[business]].  if i lay up, ‘tis for some near and contemplated [[purpose]];
not to purchase lands [[land]], of which i have no need, but to purchase [[pleasure]]:

     “non esse cupidum, pecunia est; non esse emacem, vertigal est.”

     [“not to be covetous, is [[money]]; not to be acquisitive, is [[revenue]].”
      --cicero, paradox., vi. 3.]

i neither am in any [[great]] apprehension of wanting, nor in [[desire]] of any
more:

     “divinarum fructus est in copia; copiam declarat satietas.”

     [“the fruit of riches [[rich]] is in abundance; satiety declares abundance.”
      --idem, ibid., vi. 2.]

and i am very well pleased that this reformation in me has fallen out in
an [[age]] naturally inclined to avarice, and that i see myself cleared of a
folly so [[common]] to old [[men]], and the most ridiculous of all [[human]] follies.

feraulez, a [[man]] that had run through both fortunes [[fortune]], and found that the
increase of substance was no increase of appetite either to eating or
drinking, sleeping or the enjoyment of his [[wife]], and who on the other
side [[felt]] the [[care]] of his economics [[lie]] heavy upon his shoulders, as it
does on mine, was resolved to please a [[poor]] [[young]] [[man]], his faithful
friend, who panted after riches [[rich]], and made him a gift of all his, which
were excessively [[great]], and, moreover, of all he was in the daily way of
getting by the liberality of cyrus, his [[good]] master, and by the [[war]];
conditionally that he should take [[care]] handsomely to maintain and
plentifully to entertain him as his guest and friend; which being
accordingly done, they afterwards lived very happily together, both of
them equally content with the [[change]] of their condition.  ‘tis an example
that i could imitate with all my [[heart]]; and i very much approve the
fortune of the aged prelate whom i see to have so absolutely stripped
himself of his purse, his [[revenue]], and [[care]] of his expense, committing
them one while to one trusty servant, and another while to another, that
he has spun out a long succession of years, as ignorant, by this means,
of his domestic affairs as a mere stranger.

the confidence in another man’s [[virtue]] is no [[light]] evidence of a man’s
own, and [[god]] willingly favours such a confidence.  as to what concerns
him of whom i am speaking, i see nowhere a [[better]] governed house, more
nobly and constantly maintained than his.  [[happy]] to have regulated his
affairs to so just a proportion that his estate is sufficient to do it
without his [[care]] or trouble, and without any hindrance, either in the
spending or laying it up, to his other more quiet employments, and more
suitable both to his place and liking.

plenty, then, and indigence depend upon the [[opinion]] every one has of
them; and riches [[rich]] no more than [[glory]] or health have other [[beauty]] or
pleasure than he lends them by whom they are possessed.

every one is well or ill at ease, according as he so finds himself; not
he whom the [[world]] believes [[belief]], but he who believes [[belief]] himself to be so, is
content; and in this alone [[belief]] gives itself being and reality.
fortune does us neither [[good]] nor hurt; she only presents [[present]] us the matter
and the seed, which our [[soul]], more powerful than she, turns and applies
as she [[best]] pleases; the sole cause and [[sovereign]] mistress of her own
happy or unhappy condition.  all external accessions receive taste and
colour from the internal [[constitution]], as clothes warm us, not with their
heat, but our own, which they are fit to cover and nourish; he who would
shield therewith a cold [[body]], would do the same service for the cold, for
so snow and ice are preserved.  and, certes, after the same manner that
study is a torment to an idle [[man]], abstinence from wine to a drunkard,
frugality to the spendthrift, and exercise to a lazy, tender-bred fellow,
so it is of all the rest.  the things are not so painful and difficult of
themselves, but our weakness or cowardice makes them so.  to [[judge]] of
great, and high matters requires a suitable [[soul]]; otherwise we attribute
the [[vice]] to them which is really our own.  a straight oar seems crooked
in the water it does not only import that we see the thing, but how and
after what manner we see it.

after all this, why, amongst so many discourses that by so many arguments
persuade [[men]] to despise [[death]] and to endure [[pain]], can we not find out one
that helps us?  and of so many sorts of imaginations [[imagination]] as have so prevailed
upon others as to persuade them to do so, why does not every one apply
some one to himself, the most suitable to his own [[humour]]?  if he cannot
digest a strong-working decoction to eradicate the [[evil]], let him at least
take a lenitive to ease it:

     [“it is an effeminate and flimsy [[opinion]], nor more so in [[pain]] than
     in [[pleasure]], in which, while we are at our ease, we cannot bear
     without a cry the sting of a bee.  the whole [[business]] is to commend
     thyself.”--cicero, tusc.  quaes., ii. 22.]

as to the rest, a [[man]] does not transgress [[philosophy]] by permitting the
acrimony of pains [[pain]] and [[human]] frailty to prevail so much above measure; for
they constrain her to go back to her unanswerable replies: “if it be ill
to [[live]] in necessity, at least there is no necessity upon a [[man]] to live
in necessity”: “no [[man]] continues ill long but by his own [[fault]].”  he who
has neither the [[courage]] to [[die]] nor the [[heart]] to [[live]], who will neither
resist nor fly, what can we do with him?




chapter xli

not to communicate a man’s honour

of all the follies of the [[world]], that which is most universally received
is the solicitude of [[reputation]] and [[glory]]; which we are fond of to that
degree as to abandon riches [[rich]], [[peace]], [[life]], and health, which are effectual
and substantial goods [[good]], to pursue this [[vain]] phantom and empty word, that
has neither [[body]] nor hold to be taken of it:

               la fama, ch’invaghisce a un dolce suono
               gli superbi mortali, et par si bella,
               e un eco, un sogno, anzi d’un sogno un’ombra,
               ch’ad ogni vento si dilegua a sgombra.”

     [“fame, which with alluring sound charms proud mortals, and appears
     so [[fair]], is but an echo, a [[dream]], nay, the shadow of a [[dream]], which
     at every breath vanishes and dissolves.”
      --tasso, gerus., xiv. 63.]

and of all the irrational humours [[humour]] of [[men]], it should seem that the
philosophers themselves are among the [[last]] and the most reluctant to
disengage themselves from this: ‘tis the most restive and obstinate of
all:

         “quia etiam bene proficientes animos tentare non cessat.”

     [“because it ceases not to assail even well-directed minds”
      --st. augustin, de civit. dei, v. 14.]

there is not any one of which [[reason]] so clearly accuses the vanity; but
it is so deeply rooted in us that i dare not determine whether any one
ever clearly discharged himself from it or no.  after you have said all
and believed all has been said to its prejudice, it produces [[produce]] so intestine
an inclination in opposition to your [[best]] arguments that you have little
power to resist it; for, as cicero says,  even those who most controvert
it, would yet that the books [[book]] they write about it should visit the light
under their own names, and seek to derive [[glory]] from seeming to despise
it.  all other things are communicable and fall into commerce: we lend
our goods [[good]] and stake our lives [[life]] for the necessity and service of our
friends; but to communicate a man’s [[honour]], and to robe another with a
man’s own [[glory]], is very rarely seen.

and yet we have some examples [[example]] of that [[kind]].  catulus luctatius in the
cimbrian [[war]], having done all that in him lay to make his flying soldiers
face about upon the [[enemy]], ran himself at [[last]] away with the rest, and
counterfeited the [[coward]], to the end his [[men]] might rather seem to follow
their captain than to fly from the [[enemy]]; which was to abandon his own
reputation in order to cover the shame of others.  when charles v. came
into provence in the year 1537, ‘tis said that antonio de leva, seeing
the [[emperor]] positively resolved upon this expedition, and believing it
would redound very much to his [[honour]], did, nevertheless, very stiffly
oppose it in the council, to the end that the entire [[glory]] of that
resolution should be attributed to his master, and that it might be said
his own [[wisdom]] and foresight had been such as that, contrary to the
opinion of all, he had brought about so [[great]] an enterprise; which was to
do him [[honour]] at his own expense.  the thracian ambassadors coming to
comfort archileonida, the [[mother]] of brasidas, upon the [[death]] of her [[son]],
and commending him to that height as to say he had not left his like
behind him, she rejected this private and particular commendation to
attribute it to the [[public]]: “tell me not that,” said she; “i [[know]] the
city of sparta has many [[citizens]] both greater and of greater worth than
he.”   in the [[battle]] of crecy, the [[prince]] of wales, being then very
young, had the vanguard committed to him: the main stress of the battle
happened to be in that place, which made the lords [[lord]] who were with him,
finding themselves overmatched, send to [[king]] edward to advance to their
relief.  he inquired of the condition his [[son]] was in, and being answered
that he was alive and on horseback: “i should, then, do him [[wrong]],” said
the [[king]], “now to go and deprive him of the [[honour]] of winning this battle
he has so long and so bravely sustained; what hazard soever he runs, that
shall be entirely his own”; and, accordingly, would neither go nor send,
knowing that if he went, it would be said all had been lost without his
succour, and that the [[honour]] of the [[victory]] would be wholly attributed to
him.

              “semper enim quod postremum adjectum est,
               id rem totam videtur traxisse.”

     [“for always that which is [[last]] added, seems to have accomplished
     the whole affair.”--livy, xxvii. 45.]

many at [[rome]] [[thought]], and would usually say, that the [[greatest]] of
scipio’s acts were in part due to laelius, whose constant practice it was
still to advance and support scipio’s grandeur and renown, without any
care of his own.  and theopompus, [[king]] of sparta, to him who told him the
republic could not miscarry since he knew so well how to command, “tis
rather,” answered he, “because the [[people]] [[know]] so well how to obey.”
 as [[women]] succeeding to peerages had, notwithstanding their [[sex]], the
privilege to attend and give their votes in the trials that appertained
to the jurisdiction of peers; so the ecclesiastical peers,
notwithstanding their profession, were obliged to attend our kings [[king]] in
their wars [[war]], not only with their [[friends]] and servants, but in their own
persons.  as the bishop of beauvais did, who being with philip augustus
at the [[battle]] of bouvines, had a notable share in that action; but he did
not [[think]] it fit for him to participate in the fruit and [[glory]] of that
violent and bloody [[trade]].  he with his own hand reduced several of the
enemy that day to his [[mercy]], whom he delivered to the first gentleman he
met either to kill or receive them to quarter, referring the whole
execution to this other hand; and he did this with regard to william,
earl of salisbury, whom he gave up to messire jehan de nesle.  with a
like subtlety of [[conscience]] to that i have just named, he would kill but
not wound, and for that [[reason]] ever fought with a mace.  and a certain
person of my [[time]], being reproached by the [[king]] that he had laid hands on
a [[priest]], stiffly and positively denied he had done any such thing: the
meaning of which was, he had cudgelled and kicked him.




chapter xlii

of the inequality amoungst us.

plutarch says somewhere that he does not find so [[great]] a difference
betwixt beast and beast as he does betwixt [[man]] and [[man]]; which he says in
reference to the internal qualities and perfections of the [[soul]].  and, in
truth, i find so vast a distance betwixt epaminondas, according to my
judgment of him, and some that i [[know]], who are yet [[men]] of [[good]] sense,
that i could willingly enhance upon plutarch, and say that there is more
difference betwixt such and such a [[man]] than there is betwixt such a man
and such a beast:

          [“ah! how much may one [[man]] surpass another!”
           --terence, eunuchus, ii. 2.]

and that there are as many and innumerable degrees [[degree]] of [[mind]] as there are
cubits betwixt this and [[heaven]].  but as touching the estimate of [[men]],
‘tis [[strange]] that, ourselves excepted, no other creature is esteemed
beyond its proper qualities; we commend a horse for his [[strength]] and
sureness of foot,

                              “volucrem
               sic laudamus equum, facili cui plurima palma
               fervet, et exsultat rauco victoria circo,”

     [“so we [[praise]] the swift horse, for whose easy mastery many a hand
     glows in applause, and [[victory]] exults in the hoarse circus.
     --“juvenal, viii. 57.]

and not for his [[rich]] caparison; a greyhound for his speed of heels, not
for his fine collar; a hawk for her wing, not for her gesses and bells.
why, in like manner, do we not value a [[man]] for what is properly his own?
he has a [[great]] train, a beautiful palace, so much credit, so many
thousand pounds a year: all these are about him, but not in him.  you
will not buy a pig in a poke: if you cheapen a horse, you will see him
stripped of his housing-cloths, you will see him naked and open to your
eye; or if he be clothed, as they anciently were wont to [[present]] them to
princes to sell, ‘tis only on the less important parts, that you may not
so much consider the [[beauty]] of his colour or the breadth of his crupper,
as principally to examine his legs, [[eyes]], and feet, which are the members
of [[greatest]] use:

         “regibus hic mos est: ubi equos mercantur, opertos
          inspiciunt; ne, si facies, ut saepe, decora
          molli fulta pede est, emptorem inducat hiantem”

     [“this is the custom of kings [[king]]: when they buy horses, they have open
     inspection, lest, if a [[fair]] head, as often chances [[chance]], is supported by
     a [[weak]] foot, it should tempt the gaping purchaser.”
      --horace, sat., i. 2, 86.]

why, in giving your estimate of a [[man]], do you prize him wrapped and
muffled up in clothes?  he then discovers nothing to you but such parts
as are not in the least his own, and conceals those by which alone one
may rightly [[judge]] of his value.  ‘tis the price of the blade that you
inquire into, not of the scabbard: you would not peradventure bid a
farthing for him, if you saw him stripped.  you are to [[judge]] him by
himself and not by what he wears; and, as one of the ancients very
pleasantly said: “do you [[know]] why you repute him tall?  you reckon withal
the height of his pattens.”--[seneca, ep. 76.]--the pedestal is no part
of the statue.  measure him without his stilts; let him lay aside his
revenues and his titles; let him [[present]] himself in his shirt. then
examine if his [[body]] be sound and sprightly, active and disposed to
perform its functions.  what [[soul]] has he?  is she beautiful, capable, and
happily provided of all her faculties?  is she [[rich]] of what is her own,
or of what she has borrowed?  has [[fortune]] no hand in the affair?  can
she, without winking, stand the lightning of swords [[sword]]? is she indifferent
whether her [[life]] expire by the mouth or through the throat?  is she
settled, even and content?  this is what is to be examined, and by that
you are to [[judge]] of the vast differences betwixt [[man]] and [[man]].  is he:

          “sapiens, sibique imperiosus,
          quern neque pauperies, neque mors, neque vincula terrent;
          responsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores
          fortis; et in seipso totus teres atque rotundus,
          externi ne quid valeat per laeve morari;
          in quem manca ruit semper fortuna?”


     [“the [[wise]] [[man]], self-governed, whom neither [[poverty]], nor [[death]],
     nor chains affright: who has the [[strength]] to resist his appetites
     and to contemn honours [[honour]]: who is wholly self-contained: whom no
     external objects affect: whom [[fortune]] assails in [[vain]].”
      --horace, sat., ii. 7,]

such a [[man]] is five hundred cubits above kingdoms [[kingdom]] and duchies; he is an
absolute monarch in and to himself:

          “sapiens, .  .  .  pol!  ipse fingit fortunam sibi;”

          [“the [[wise]] [[man]] is the master of his own [[fortune]],”
           --plautus, trin., ii. 2, 84.]

what remains for him to covet or [[desire]]?

                         “nonne videmus,
          nil aliud sibi naturam latrare, nisi ut, quoi
          corpore sejunctus dolor absit, mente fruatur,
          jucundo sensu, cura semotu’ metuque?”

     [“do we not see that [[human]] [[nature]] asks no more for itself than
     that, [[free]] from bodily [[pain]], it may exercise its [[mind]] agreeably,
     exempt from [[care]] and [[fear]].”--lucretius, ii. 16.]

compare with such a one the [[common]] rabble of [[mankind]], stupid and
mean-spirited, servile, instable, and continually floating with the
tempest of various [[passions]], that tosses and tumbles them to and fro, and
all depending upon others, and you will find a greater distance than
betwixt [[heaven]] and [[earth]]; and yet the blindness of [[common]] usage is such
that we make little or no account of it; whereas if we consider a peasant
and a [[king]], a nobleman and a vassal, a magistrate and a private [[man]], a
rich [[man]] and a [[poor]], there appears a vast disparity, though they differ
no more, as a [[man]] may say, than in their breeches.

in thrace the [[king]] was distinguished from his [[people]] after a very
pleasant and especial manner; he had a [[religion]] by himself, a [[god]] all his
own, and which his subjects [[subject]] were not to presume to adore, which was
mercury, whilst, on the other hand, he disdained to have anything to do
with theirs, [[mars]], bacchus, and diana.  and yet they are no other than
pictures that make no essential dissimilitude; for as you see actors in a
play representing the [[person]] of a duke or an [[emperor]] upon the stage, and
immediately after return to their true and original condition of valets
and porters, so the [[emperor]], whose pomp and lustre so dazzle you in
public:

               “scilicet grandes viridi cum luce smaragdi
               auto includuntur, teriturque thalassina vestis
               assidue, et veneris sudorem exercita potat;”

     [“because he wears [[great]] emeralds richly set in gold, darting green
     lustre; and the sea-blue silken robe, worn with pressure, and moist
     with illicit [[love]] (and absorbs the sweat of venus).”
      --lucretius, iv. 1123.]

do but peep behind the curtain, and you will see no thing more than an
ordinary [[man]], and peradventure more contemptible than the meanest of his
subjects:

     “ille beatus introrsum est, istius bracteata felicitas est;”

     [“the one is [[happy]] in himself; the [[happiness]] of the other is
     counterfeit.”--seneca, ep., 115.]

cowardice, irresolution, [[ambition]], spite, and envy agitate him as much as
another:

              “non enim gazae, neque consularis
               submovet lictor miseros tumultus
               mentis, et curas laqueata circum
               tecta volantes.”

     [“for not treasures, nor the consular lictor, can remove the
     miserable tumults of the [[mind]], nor cares [[care]] that fly about panelled
     ceilings.”--horace, od., ii. 16, 9.]

care and [[fear]] attack him even in the centre of his battalions:

               “re veraque metus hominum curaeque sequaces
               nec metuunt sonitus armorum, nee fera tela;
               audacterque inter reges, rerumque potentes
               versantur, neque fulgorem reverentur ab auro.”

     [“and in [[truth]] the fears [[fear]] and haunting cares [[care]] of [[men]] [[fear]] not the
     clash of arms nor points of darts, and mingle boldly with great
     kings [[king]] and [[men]] in [[authority]], nor [[respect]] the glitter of gold.”
      --lucretius, ii. 47.]

do fevers, gout, and apoplexies spare him any more than one of us?  when
old [[age]] hangs heavy upon his shoulders, can the yeomen of his guard ease
him of the burden?  when he is astounded with the apprehension of [[death]],
can the gentlemen of his bedchamber comfort and assure him?  when
jealousy or any other caprice swims in his brain, can our compliments and
ceremonies restore him to his good-humour?  the canopy embroidered with
pearl and gold he lies [[lie]] under has no [[virtue]] against a [[violent]] fit of the
colic:

               “nee calidae citius decedunt corpore febres
               textilibus si in picturis, ostroque rubenti
               jactaris, quam si plebeia in veste cubandum est.”

     [“nor do burning fevers quit you sooner if you are stretched on a
     couch of [[rich]] tapestry and in a vest of purple dye, than if you be
     in a coarse blanket.”--idem, ii. 34.]

the flatterers of alexander the [[great]] possessed him that he was the son
of [[jupiter]]; but being one day wounded, and observing the [[blood]] stream
from his wound: “what say you now, my masters,” said he, “is not this
blood of a crimson colour and purely [[human]]?  this is not of the
complexion of that which [[homer]] makes to issue from the wounded gods.”
 the poet hermodorus had written a poem in [[honour]] of antigonus, wherein
he called him the [[son]] of the sun: “he who has the emptying of my
close-stool,” said antigonus, “knows to the contrary.”  he is but a man
at [[best]], and if he be deformed or ill-qualified from his birth, the
empire of the [[universe]] cannot set him to rights [[right]]:

                                   “puellae
          hunc rapiant; quidquid calcaverit hic, rosa fiat,”

     [“let girls carry him off; wherever he steps let there spring up a
     rose!”--persius, sat., ii. 38.]

what of all that, if he be a [[fool]]?  even [[pleasure]] and [[good]] [[fortune]] are
not relished without vigour and understanding:

          “haec perinde sunt, ut ilius animus; qui ea possidet
          qui uti scit, ei bona; illi, qui non uritur recte, mala.”

     [“things are, as is the [[mind]] of their possessor; who knows [[know]] how to
     use them, to him they are [[good]]; to him who abuses [[abuse]] them, ill.”
      --terence, [[heart]]., i.  3, 21.]

whatever the benefits of [[fortune]] are, they yet require a palate to relish
them.  ‘tis fruition, and not possession, that renders us [[happy]]:

     [“‘tis not lands [[land]], or a heap of brass and gold, that has removed
     fevers from the ailing [[body]] of the owner, or cares [[care]] from his [[mind]].
     the possessor must be healthy, if he thinks [[think]] to make [[good]] use of his
     realised [[wealth]].  to him who is covetous or timorous his house and
     estate are as a picture to a blind [[man]], or a fomentation to a
     gouty.”--horace, ep., i. 2, 47.]

he is a sot, his taste is palled and flat; he no more enjoys what he has
than one that has a cold relishes the flavour of canary, or than a horse
is sensible of his [[rich]] caparison.  [[plato]] is in the [[right]] when he tells
us that health, [[beauty]], vigour, and riches [[rich]], and all the other things
called goods [[good]], are equally [[evil]] to the [[unjust]] as [[good]] to the just, and the
evil on the contrary the same.  and therefore where the [[body]] and the mind
are in disorder, to what use serve these external conveniences:
considering that the least prick with a pin, or the least passion of the
soul, is sufficient to deprive one of the [[pleasure]] of being sole monarch
of the [[world]].  at the first twitch of the gout it signifies much to be
called sir and your majesty!

               “totus et argento conflatus, totus et auro;”

     [“wholly made up of silver and gold.”--tibullus, i. 2, 70.]

does he not forget his palaces and girandeurs?  if he be angry, can his
being a [[prince]] keep him from looking red and looking pale, and grinding
his teeth like a madman?  now, if he be a [[man]] of parts and of right
nature, royalty adds very little to his [[happiness]];

          “si ventri bene, si lateri est, pedibusque tuffs, nil
          divitix poterunt regales addere majus;”

     [“if it is well with thy belly, thy side and thy feet, regal wealth
     will be able to add nothing.”--horace, ep., i. 12, 5.]

he discerns ‘tis nothing but counterfeit and gullery.  nay, perhaps he
would be of [[king]] seleucus’ [[opinion]], that he who knew the weight of a
sceptre would not stoop to pick it up, if he saw it lying before him, so
great and painful are the duties [[duty]] incumbent upon a [[good]] [[king]].--[plutarch,
if a sage should meddle with affairs of stale, c. 12.]--assuredly it can
be no easy task to [[rule]] others, when we find it so hard a matter to
govern ourselves; and as to dominion, that seems so charming, the frailty
of [[human]] [[judgment]] and the difficulty of [[choice]] in things that are new and
doubtful considered, i am very much of [[opinion]] that it is far more easy
and pleasant to [[follow]] than to lead; and that it is a [[great]] settlement
and satisfaction of [[mind]] to have only one path to walk in, and to have
none to [[answer]] for but a man’s [[self]];

               “ut satius multo jam sit parere quietum,
               quam regere imperio res velle.”

     [“‘tis much [[better]] quietly to obey than [[wish]] to [[rule]].”
      --lucretius, v, 1126.]

to which we may add that saying of cyrus, that no [[man]] was fit to [[rule]] but
he who in his own worth was of greater value than those he was to govern;
but [[king]] hiero in xenophon says further, that in the fruition even of
pleasure itself they are in a worse condition than private [[men]]; forasmuch
as the opportunities and facility they have of commanding those things at
will takes off from the delight that ordinary folks enjoy:

          “pinguis amor, nimiumque patens, in taedia nobis
          vertitur, et, stomacho dulcis ut esca, nocet.”

     [“love in excess and too palpable turns to weariness, and, like
     sweetmeats to the stomach, is injurious.”--ovid, amoy., ii. 19, 25.]

can we [[think]] that the singing boys of the choir take any [[great]] delight in
music?  the satiety rather renders it troublesome and tedious to them.
feasts, balls, masquerades and tiltings delight such as but rarely see,
and [[desire]] to see, them; but having been frequently at such
entertainments, the relish of them grows flat and insipid.  nor do women
so much delight those who make a [[common]] practice of the [[sport]].  he who
will not give himself leisure to be thirsty can never find the true
pleasure of drinking.  farces and tumbling tricks are pleasant to the
spectators, but a wearisome toil to those by whom they are performed.
and that this is so, we see that princes [[prince]] divert themselves sometimes in
disguising their quality, awhile to depose themselves, and to stoop to
the [[poor]] and ordinary way of living of the meanest of their [[people]].

              “plerumque gratae divitibus vices
               mundaeque parvo sub lare pauperum
               coenae, sine aulaeis et ostro,
               soliicitam explicuere frontem.”

     [“the [[rich]] are often pleased with variety; and the plain supper in a
     [[poor]] cottage, without tapestry and purple, has relaxed the anxious
     brow.”--horace, od., iii.  29, 13.]

nothing is so distasteful and clogging as abundance.  what appetite would
not be baffled to see three hundred [[women]] at its [[mercy]], as the grand
signor has in his seraglio?  and, of his [[ancestors]] what fruition or taste
of [[sport]] did he reserve to himself, who never went hawking without seven
thousand falconers?  and besides all this, i fancy that this lustre of
grandeur brings with it no little disturbance and uneasiness upon the
enjoyment of the most tempting pleasures [[pleasure]]; the [[great]] are too conspicuous
and [[lie]] too open to every one’s view.  neither do i [[know]] to what end a
man should more require of them to conceal their errors, since what is
only reputed indiscretion in us, the [[people]] in them brand with the names
of [[tyranny]] and contempt of the laws [[law]], and, besides their proclivity to
vice, are apt to hold that it is a heightening of [[pleasure]] to them, to
insult over and to trample upon [[public]] observances.  [[plato]], indeed, in
his goygias, defines a [[tyrant]] to be one who in a [[city]] has licence to do
whatever his own will leads him to do; and by [[reason]] of this impunity,
the display and publication of their vices [[vice]] do ofttimes more mischief than
the [[vice]] itself.  every one fears [[fear]] to be pried into and overlooked; but
princes are so, even to their very gestures, looks and thoughts [[thought]], the
people conceiving they have [[right]] and title to be judges [[judge]] of them besides
that the blemishes of the [[great]] naturally appear greater by [[reason]] of the
eminence and lustre of the place where they are seated, and that a mole
or a wart appears greater in them than a wide gash in others.  and this
is the [[reason]] why the poets feign the amours of [[jupiter]] to be performed
in the disguises of so many borrowed shapes, and that amongst the many
amorous practices they lay to his charge, there is only one, as i
remember, where he appears in his own majesty and grandeur.

but let us return to hiero, who further complains of the inconveniences
he found in his royalty, in that he could not look abroad and travel the
world at [[liberty]], being as it were a [[prisoner]] in the bounds and limits of
his own dominion, and that in all his actions he was evermore surrounded
with an importunate crowd.  and in [[truth]], to see our kings [[king]] sit all alone
at table, environed with so many [[people]] prating about them, and so many
strangers staring upon them, as they always are, i have often been moved
rather to [[pity]] than to envy their condition.  [[king]] alfonso was wont to
say, that in this asses were in a [[better]] condition than kings [[king]], their
masters permitting them to feed at their own ease and [[pleasure]], a favour
that kings [[king]] cannot obtain of their servants.  and it has never come into
my fancy that it could be of any [[great]] benefit to the [[life]] of a [[man]] of
sense to have twenty [[people]] prating about him when he is at stool; or
that the services of a [[man]] of ten thousand livres a year, or that has
taken casale or defended siena, should be either more commodious or more
acceptable to him, than those of a [[good]] groom of the chamber who
understands his place.  the advantages of sovereignty are in a manner but
imaginary: every [[degree]] of [[fortune]] has in it some image of principality.
caesar calls all the lords [[lord]] of [[france]], having [[free]] franchise within their
own demesnes, roitelets or petty kings [[king]]; and in [[truth]], the name of sire
excepted, they go pretty far towards kingship; for do but look into the
provinces remote from court, as brittany for [[example]]; take notice of the
train, the vassals, the officers, the employments, service, [[ceremony]], and
state of a [[lord]] who lives [[life]] retired from court in his own house, amongst
his own tenants and servants; and observe withal the flight of his
imagination; there is nothing more [[royal]]; he hears talk of his master
once a year, as of a [[king]] of [[persia]], without taking any further
recognition of him, than by some remote kindred his secretary keeps in
some register.  and, to speak the [[truth]], our laws [[law]] are easy enough, so
easy that a gentleman of [[france]] scarce feels [[feel]] the weight of sovereignty
pinch his shoulders above twice in his [[life]].  real and effectual
subjection only concerns such amongst us as voluntarily thrust their
necks under the yoke, and who design to get [[wealth]] and honours [[honour]] by such
services: for a [[man]] that loves [[love]] his own fireside, and can govern his house
without falling by the ears with his neighbours or engaging in suits of
law, is as [[free]] as a duke of venice.

               “paucos servitus, plures servitutem tenent.”

          [“servitude enchains few, but many enchain themselves to
          servitude.”--seneca, ep., 22.]

but that which hiero is most concerned at is, that he finds himself
stripped of all [[friendship]], deprived of all mutual [[society]], wherein the
true and most [[perfect]] fruition of [[human]] [[life]] consists.  for what
testimony of affection and goodwill can i extract from him that owes me,
whether he will or no, all that he is able to do?  can i form any
assurance of his real [[respect]] to me, from his humble way of speaking and
submissive behaviour, when these are ceremonies [[ceremony]] it is not in his choice
to deny?  the [[honour]] we receive from those that [[fear]] us is not [[honour]];
those respects [[respect]] are due to royalty and not to me:

               “maximum hoc regni bonum est
               quod facta domini cogitur populus sui
               quam ferre, tam laudare.”

     [“‘tis the [[greatest]] benefit of a [[kingdom]] that the [[people]] is forced
     to commend, as well as to bear the acts of the ruler.”
      --seneca, thyestes, ii.  i, 30.]

do i not see that the wicked and the [[good]] [[king]], he that is hated and he
that is beloved, have the one as much reverence paid him as the other?
my predecessor was, and my successor shall be, served with the same
ceremony and [[state]].  if my subjects [[subject]] do me no harm, ‘tis no evidence of
any [[good]] affection; why should i look upon it as such, seeing it is not
in their [[power]] to do it if they would?  no one follows me or obeys my
commands upon the account of any [[friendship]], betwixt him and me; there
can be no contracting of [[friendship]] where there is so little relation and
correspondence: my own height has put me out of the familiarity of and
intelligence with [[men]]; there is too [[great]] disparity and disproportion
betwixt us.  they [[follow]] me either upon the account of decency and
custom; or rather my [[fortune]], than me, to increase their own.  all they
say to me or do for me is but outward paint, appearance, their liberty
being on all parts restrained by the [[great]] [[power]] and [[authority]] i have
over them.  i see nothing about me but what is dissembled and disguised.

the [[emperor]] julian being one day applauded by his courtiers for his exact
justice: “i should be proud of these praises [[praise]],” said he, “did they come
from persons [[person]] that durst condemn or disapprove the contrary, in case i
should do it.”  all the real advantages of princes [[prince]] are [[common]] to them
with [[men]] of meaner condition (‘tis for the gods to mount winged horses
and feed upon ambrosia): they have no other sleep, nor other appetite
than we; the steel they arm themselves withal is of no [[better]] temper than
that we also use; their crowns [[crown]] neither defend them from the rain nor the
sun.

diocletian, who wore a [[crown]] so fortunate and revered, resigned it to
retire to the felicity of a private [[life]]; and some [[time]] after the
necessity of [[public]] affairs requiring that he should reassume his charge,
he made [[answer]] to those who came to court him to it: “you would not
offer,” said he, “to persuade me to this, had you seen the fine order of
the trees i have planted in my orchard, and the [[fair]] melons i have sown
in my garden.”

in anacharsis’ [[opinion]], the happiest [[state]] of [[government]] would be where,
all other things being [[equal]], precedence should be measured out by the
virtues, and repulses by the vices [[vice]] of [[men]].

when [[king]] pyrrhus prepared for his expedition into [[italy]], his wise
counsellor cyneas, to make him sensible of the vanity of his [[ambition]]:
“well, sir,” said he, “to what end do you make all this mighty
preparation?”--“to make myself master of [[italy]],” replied the [[king]].
“and what after that  is done?” said cyneas.  “i will pass over into gaul
and [[spain]],” said the other.  “and what then?”--“i will then go to subdue
africa; and lastly, when i have brought the whole [[world]] to my subjection,
i will sit down and rest content at my own ease.”

“for [[god]] sake, sir,” replied cyneas, “tell me what hinders that you may
not, if you please, be now in the condition you speak of?  why do you not
now at this instant settle yourself in the [[state]] you seem to aim at, and
spare all the [[labour]] and hazard you interpose?”

         “nimirum, quia non cognovit, qux esset habendi
          finis, et omnino quoad crescat vera voluptas.”

     [“forsooth because he does not [[know]] what should be the limit of
     acquisition, and altogether how far real [[pleasure]] should increase.”
      --lucretius, v. 1431]

i will conclude with an old versicle, that i [[think]] very apt to the
purpose:

               “mores cuique sui fingunt fortunam.”

               [“every [[man]] frames his own [[fortune]].”
                --cornelius nepos, [[life]] of atticus]




chapter xliii

of sumptuary laws

the way by which our laws [[law]] attempt to regulate idle and [[vain]] expenses in
meat and clothes, seems to be quite contrary to the end designed.  the
true way would be to beget in [[men]] a contempt of silks and gold, as [[vain]],
frivolous, and useless; whereas we augment to them the honours [[honour]], and
enhance the value of such things, which, sure, is a very improper way to
create a disgust.  for to enact that none but princes [[prince]] shall [[eat]] turbot,
shall wear velvet or gold lace, and interdict these things to the [[people]],
what is it but to bring them into a greater esteem, and to set every one
more agog to [[eat]] and wear them?  let kings [[king]] leave off these ensigns of
grandeur; they have others enough besides; those excesses are more
excusable in any other than a [[prince]].  we may learn by the [[example]] of
several nations [[better]] ways of exterior distinction of quality (which,
truly, i conceive to be very requisite in a state) enough, without
fostering to this [[purpose]] such [[corruption]] and manifest inconvenience.
‘tis [[strange]] how suddenly and with how much ease custom in these
indifferent things establishes itself and becomes [[authority]].  we had
scarce worn cloth a year, in compliance with the court, for the mourning
of henry ii., but that silks were already grown into such contempt with
every one, that a [[man]] so clad was presently concluded a citizen: silks
were divided betwixt the physicians and surgeons, and though all other
people almost went in the same habit, there was, notwithstanding, in one
thing or other, sufficient distinction of the several conditions of [[men]].
how suddenly do greasy chamois and linen doublets become the [[fashion]] in
our armies [[army]], whilst all neatness and richness of habit fall into contempt?
let kings [[king]] but lead the dance and begin to leave off this expense, and in
a month the [[business]] will be done throughout the [[kingdom]], without edict
or ordinance; we shall all [[follow]].  it should be rather proclaimed, on
the contrary, that no one should wear scarlet or goldsmiths’ [[work]] but
courtesans and tumblers.

zeleucus by the like invention reclaimed the corrupted manners of the
locrians.  his laws [[law]] were, that no [[free]] woman should be allowed any more
than one maid to [[follow]] her, unless she was drunk: nor was to stir out of
the [[city]] by night, wear jewels of gold about her, or go in an embroidered
robe, unless she was a professed and [[public]] prostitute; that, bravos
excepted, no [[man]] was to wear a gold ring, nor be seen in one of those
effeminate robes woven in the [[city]] of miletus.  by which infamous
exceptions he discreetly diverted his [[citizens]] from superfluities and
pernicious pleasures [[pleasure]], and it was a project of [[great]] utility to attract
then by [[honour]] and [[ambition]] to their [[duty]] and [[obedience]].

our kings [[king]] can do what they please in such external reformations; their
own inclination stands in this case for a [[law]]:

          “quicquid principes faciunt, praecipere videntur.”

     [“what princes [[prince]] themselves do, they seem to prescribe.”
      --quintil., declam., 3.]

whatever is done at court passes for a [[rule]] through the rest of [[france]].
let the courtiers fall out with these abominable breeches, that discover
so much of those parts should be concealed; these [[great]] bellied doublets,
that make us look like i [[know]] not what, and are so unfit to admit of
arms; these long effeminate locks of hair; this foolish custom of kissing
what we [[present]] to our equals [[equal]], and our hands in saluting them, a ceremony
in former times [[time]] only due to princes [[prince]].  let them not permit that a
gentleman shall appear in place of [[respect]] without his [[sword]], unbuttoned
and untrussed, as though he came from the house of office; and that,
contrary to the custom of our forefathers and the particular [[privilege]] of
the nobles [[noble]] of this [[kingdom]], we stand a long [[time]] bare to them in what
place soever, and the same to a hundred others, so many tiercelets and
quartelets of kings [[king]] we have got nowadays and other like vicious
innovations: they will see them all presently vanish and cried down.
these are, ‘tis true, but superficial errors; but they are of ill augury,
and enough to inform us that the whole fabric is crazy and tottering,
when we see the roughcast of our walls to cleave and split.

plato in his laws [[law]] esteems nothing of more pestiferous consequence to his
city than to give [[young]] [[men]] the [[liberty]] of introducing any [[change]] in
their habits, gestures, dances, songs [[song]], and exercises, from one form to
another; shifting from this to that, hunting after novelties, and
applauding the inventors; by which means manners are corrupted and the
old [[institutions]] come to be nauseated and despised.  in all things,
saving only in those that are [[evil]], a [[change]] is to be feared; even the
change of seasons, winds, viands, and humours [[humour]].  and no laws [[law]] are in their
true credit, but such to which [[god]] has given so long a continuance that
no one knows [[know]] their beginning, or that there ever was any other.




chapter xliv

of sleep

reason directs that we should always go the same way, but not always at
the same pace.  and, consequently, though a [[wise]] [[man]] ought not so much to
give the reins to [[human]] [[passions]] as to let him deviate from the right
path, he may, notwithstanding, without prejudice to his [[duty]], leave it to
them to hasten or to slacken his speed, and not fix himself like a
motionless and insensible colossus.  could [[virtue]] itself put on flesh and
blood, i [[believe]] the pulse would beat faster going on to assault than in
going to dinner: that is to say, there is a necessity she should heat and
be moved upon this account.  i have taken notice, as of an extraordinary
thing, of some [[great]] [[men]], who in the highest enterprises and most
important affairs have kept themselves in so settled and serene a calm,
as not at all to break their sleep.  alexander the [[great]], on the day
assigned for that furious [[battle]] betwixt him and darius, slept so
profoundly and so long in the morning, that parmenio was forced to enter
his chamber, and coming to his bedside, to call him several times [[time]] by his
name, the [[time]] to go to [[fight]] compelling him so to do.  the [[emperor]] otho,
having put on a resolution to kill himself that night, after having
settled his domestic affairs, divided his [[money]] amongst his servants, and
set a [[good]] edge upon a [[sword]] he had made [[choice]] of for the [[purpose]], and
now staying only to be satisfied whether all his [[friends]] had retired in
safety, he fell into so sound a sleep that the gentlemen of his chamber
heard him snore.  the [[death]] of this [[emperor]] has in it circumstances
paralleling that of the [[great]] cato, and particularly this just related
for cato being ready to despatch himself, whilst he only stayed his hand
in expectation of the return of a messenger he had sent to bring him news
whether the senators he had sent away were put out from the port of
utica, he fell into so sound a sleep, that they heard him snore in the
next room; and the [[man]], whom he had sent to the port, having awakened him
to let him [[know]] that the tempestuous weather had hindered the senators
from putting to sea, he despatched away another messenger, and composing
again himself in the bed, settled to sleep, and slept till by the return
of the [[last]] messenger he had [[certain]] [[intelligence]] they were gone.  we may
here further compare him with alexander in the [[great]] and dangerous storm
that threatened him by the sedition of the tribune metellus, who,
attempting to publish a decree for the calling in of pompey with his army
into the [[city]] at the [[time]] of catiline’s conspiracy, was only and that
stoutly opposed by cato, so that very sharp [[language]] and bitter menaces
passed betwixt them in the senate about that affair; but it was the next
day, in the forenoon, that the controversy was to be decided, where
metellus, besides the favour of the [[people]] and of caesar--at that [[time]] of
pompey’s faction--was to appear accompanied with a rabble of slaves [[slave]] and
gladiators; and cato only fortified with his own [[courage]] and constancy;
so that his relations, domestics, and many [[virtuous]] [[people]] of his friends
were in [[great]] apprehensions for him; and to that [[degree]], that some there
were who passed over the whole night without sleep, eating, or drinking,
for the danger they saw him running into; his [[wife]] and sisters did
nothing but weep and torment themselves in his house; whereas, he, on the
contrary, comforted every one, and after having supped after his usual
manner, went to bed, and slept profoundly till morning, when one of his
fellow-tribunes roused him to go to the encounter.  the [[knowledge]] we have
of the greatness of this man’s [[courage]] by the rest of his [[life]], may
warrant us certainly to [[judge]] that his indifference proceeded from a soul
so much elevated above such accidents, that he disdained to let it take
any more hold of his fancy than any ordinary incident.

in the naval engagement that augustus won of sextus pompeius in sicily,
just as they were to begin the [[fight]], he was so fast asleep that his
friends were compelled to wake him to give the signal of [[battle]]: and this
was it that gave mark antony afterwards [[occasion]] to reproach him that he
had not the [[courage]] so much as with open [[eyes]] to behold the order of his
own squadrons, and not to have dared to [[present]] himself before the
soldiers, till first agrippa had brought him news of the victory
obtained.  but as to the [[young]] marius, who did much worse (for the day of
his [[last]] [[battle]] against sylla, after he had marshalled his [[army]] and given
the word and signal of [[battle]], he laid him down under the shade of a tree
to repose himself, and fell so fast asleep that the rout and flight of
his [[men]] could hardly waken him, he having seen nothing of the fight), he
is said to have been at that [[time]] so extremely spent and worn out with
labour and want of sleep, that [[nature]] could hold out no longer.  now,
upon what has been said, the physicians may determine whether sleep be so
necessary that our lives [[life]] depend upon it: for we [[read]] that [[king]] perseus of
macedon, being [[prisoner]] at [[rome]], was killed by being kept from sleep; but
pliny instances such as have lived long without sleep.  herodotus speaks
of nations where the [[men]] sleep and wake by half-years, and they who write
the [[life]] of the sage epimenides affirm that he slept seven-and-fifty
years together.




chapter xlv

of the [[battle]] of dreux

     [december 19, 1562, in which the catholics, under the command of the
     duc de guise and the constable de montmorenci, defeated the
     protestants, commanded by the [[prince]] de conde.  see sismondi, hist.
     des francais, vol.  xviii., p. 354.]

our [[battle]] of dreux is remarkable for several extraordinary incidents;
but such as have no [[great]] [[kindness]] for m. de guise, nor much favour his
reputation, are willing to have him [[thought]] to blame, and that his making
a halt and delaying [[time]] with the forces [[force]] he commanded, whilst the
constable, who was general of the [[army]], was racked through and through
with the enemy’s artillery, his battalion routed, and himself taken
prisoner, is not to be excused; and that he had much [[better]] have run the
hazard of charging the [[enemy]] in flank, than staying for the advantage of
falling in upon the rear, to suffer so [[great]] and so important a loss.
but, besides what the event demonstrated, he who will consider it without
passion or prejudice will easily be induced to confess that the aim and
design, not of a captain only, but of every private soldier, ought to
regard the [[victory]] in general, and that no particular occurrences, how
nearly soever they may concern his own interest, should divert him from
that pursuit.  philopoemen,  in an encounter with machanidas, having sent
before a [[good]] [[strong]] party of his archers and slingers to begin the
skirmish, and these being routed and hotly pursued by the [[enemy]], who,
pushing on the [[fortune]] of their arms, and in that pursuit passing by the
battalion where philopoemen was, though his soldiers were impatient to
fall on, he did not [[think]] fit to stir from his post nor to present
himself to the [[enemy]] to relieve his [[men]], but having [[suffered]] these to be
chased and cut in pieces before his face, charged in upon the enemy’s
foot when he saw them left unprotected by the horse, and notwithstanding
that they were lacedaemonians, yet taking them in the nick, when thinking
themselves secure of the [[victory]], they began to disorder their ranks; he
did this [[business]] with [[great]] facility, and then put himself in pursuit of
machanidas.  which case is very like that of monsieur de guise.

in that bloody [[battle]] betwixt agesilaus and the boeotians, which
xenophon, who was [[present]] at it, reports to be the sharpest that he had
ever seen, agesilaus waived the advantage that [[fortune]] presented him, to
let the boeotian battalions pass by and then to charge them in the rear,
how [[certain]] soever he might make himself of the [[victory]], judging it would
rather be an effect of conduct than valour, to proceed that way; and
therefore, to show his prowess, rather chose with a marvellous ardour of
courage to charge them in the front; but he was well beaten and well
wounded for his pains [[pain]], and constrained at [[last]] to disengage himself, and
to take the course he had at first neglected; opening his battalion to
give way to this torrent of boeotians, and they being passed by, taking
notice that they marched in disorder, like [[men]] who [[thought]] themselves out
of danger, he pursued and charged them in flank; yet could not so prevail
as to bring it to so general a rout but that they leisurely retreated,
still facing about upon him till they had retired to safety.




chapter xlvi

of names

what variety of herbs soever are shufed together in the dish, yet the
whole mass is swallowed up under one name of a sallet.  in like manner,
under the consideration of names, i will make a hodge-podge of divers
articles.

every nation has [[certain]] names, that, i [[know]] not why, are taken in no
good sense, as with us, john, william, benedict.  in the genealogy of
princes, also, there seem to be [[certain]] names fatally affected, as the
ptolemies of [[egypt]], the henries in [[england]], the charleses in [[france]], the
baldwins in flanders, and the williams of our ancient aquitaine, from
whence, ‘tis said, the name of guyenne has its derivation; which would
seem far fetched were there not as crude derivations in [[plato]] himself.

item, ‘tis a frivolous thing in itself, but nevertheless worthy to be
recorded for the strangeness of it, that is written by an eyewitness,
that henry, duke of normandy, [[son]] of henry ii., [[king]] of [[england]], making a
great feast in [[france]], the concourse of nobility and gentry was so [[great]],
that being, for sport’s sake, divided into [[troops]], according to their
names, in the first troop, which consisted of williams, there were found
an hundred and ten knights sitting at the table of that name, without
reckoning the ordinary gentlemen and servants.

it is as pleasant to distinguish the tables by the names of the guests as
it was in the [[emperor]] geta to distinguish the several courses of his meat
by the first letters of the meats themselves; so that those that began
with b were served up together, as brawn, beef, bream, bustards,
becca-ficos; and so of the others.  item, there is a saying that it is a
good thing to have a [[good]] name, that is to say, credit and a [[good]] repute;
but besides this, it is really convenient to have a well-sounding name,
such as is easy of pronunciation and easy to be remembered, by reason
that kings [[king]] and other [[great]] persons [[person]] do by that means the more easily know
and the more hardly forget us; and indeed of our own servants we more
frequently call and employ those whose names are most ready upon the
tongue.  i myself have seen henry ii., when he could not for his heart
hit of a gentleman’s name of our [[country]] of gascony, and moreover was
fain to call one of the queen’s maids of [[honour]] by the general name of
her [[race]], her own [[family]] name being so difficult to pronounce or
remember; and [[socrates]] thinks [[think]] it worthy a father’s [[care]] to give fine
names to his [[children]].

item, ‘tis said that the foundation of notre dame la grande at poitiers
took its original from hence that a debauched [[young]] fellow formerly
living in that place, having got to him a wench, and, at her first coming
in, asking her name, and being answered that it was [[mary]], he [[felt]] himself
so suddenly pierced through with the awe of [[religion]] and the reverence to
that [[sacred]] name of the blessed virgin, that he not only immediately sent
the girl away, but became a reformed [[man]] and so continued the remainder
of his [[life]]; and that, in consideration of this miracle, there was
erected upon the place where this [[young]] man’s house stood, first a chapel
dedicated to our [[lady]] and afterwards the [[church]] that we now see standing
there.  this vocal and auricular reproof wrought upon the [[conscience]], and
that [[right]] into the [[soul]]; this that follows, insinuated itself merely by
the senses.  pythagoras being in company with some wild [[young]] fellows,
and perceiving that, heated with the feast, they comploted to go violate
an honest house, commanded the singing wench to alter her wanton airs;
and by a solemn, grave, and spondaic [[music]], gently enchanted and laid
asleep their ardour.

item, will not [[posterity]] say that our [[modern]] reformation has been
wonderfully delicate and exact, in having not only combated errors and
vices, and filled the [[world]] with devotion, [[humility]], [[obedience]], [[peace]],
and all sorts of [[virtue]]; but in having proceeded so far as to quarrel
with our ancient baptismal names of charles, louis, francis, to fill the
world with methuselahs, ezekiels, and malachis, names of a more spiritual
sound?  a gentleman, a neighbour of mine, a [[great]] admirer of antiquity,
and who was always extolling the excellences of former times [[time]] in
comparison with this [[present]] [[age]] of ours, did not, amongst the rest,
forget to dwell upon the lofty and magnificent sound of the gentleman’s
names of those days, don grumedan, quedregan, agesilan, which, but to
hear named he conceived to denote other [[kind]] of [[men]] than pierre, guillot,
and michel.

item, i am mightily pleased with jacques amyot for leaving, throughout a
whole french oration, the latin names entire, without varying and
garbling them to give them a french cadence.  it seemed a little harsh
and rough at first; but already custom, by the [[authority]] of his plutarch,
has overcome that novelty.  i have often wished that such as write
histories in latin would leave our names as they find them and as they
are; for in making vaudemont into vallemontanus, and metamorphosing names
to make them suit [[better]] with the [[greek]] or latin, we [[know]] not where we
are, and with the persons [[person]] of the [[men]] lose the benefit of the story.

to conclude, ‘tis a scurvy custom and of very ill consequence that we
have in our [[kingdom]] of [[france]] to call every one by the name of his manor
or seigneury; ‘tis the thing in the [[world]] that the most prejudices and
confounds families [[family]] and descents.  a younger [[brother]] of a [[good]] [[family]],
having a manor left him by his [[father]], by the name of which he has been
known and honoured, cannot handsomely leave it; ten years after his
decease it falls into the hand of a stranger, who does the same: do but
judge whereabouts we shall be concerning the [[knowledge]] of these [[men]].  we
need look no further for examples [[example]] than our own [[royal]] [[family]], where every
partition creates a new surname, whilst, in the meantime, the original of
the [[family]] is totally lost.  there is so [[great]] [[liberty]] taken in these
mutations, that i have not in my [[time]] seen any one advanced by [[fortune]] to
any extraordinary condition who has not presently had genealogical titles
added to him, new and unknown to his [[father]], and who has not been
inoculated into some illustrious stem by [[good]] [[luck]]; and the obscurest
families are the most apt for falsification.  how many gentlemen have we
in [[france]] who by their own account are of [[royal]] extraction? more, i
think, than who will confess they are not.  was it not a pleasant passage
of a friend of mine?  there were, several gentlemen assembled together
about the dispute of one seigneur with another; which other had, in
truth, some preeminence of titles and alliances above the ordinary
gentry.  upon the debate of this prerogative, every one, to make himself
equal to him, alleged, this one extraction, that another; this, the near
resemblance of name, that, of arms; another, an old worm-eaten patent;
the very least of them was great-grandchild to some [[foreign]] [[king]].  when
they came to sit down, to dinner, my friend, instead of taking his place
amongst them, retiring with most profound conges, entreated the company
to excuse him for having hitherto lived with them at the saucy rate of a
companion; but being now [[better]] informed of their quality, he would begin
to [[pay]] them the [[respect]] due to their birth and grandeur, and that it
would ill become him to sit down among so many princes--ending this farce
with a thousand reproaches: “let us, in [[god’s]] name, satisfy ourselves
with what our fathers [[father]] were contented with, with what we are.  we are
great enough, if we rightly [[understand]] how to maintain it.  let us not
disown the [[fortune]] and condition of our [[ancestors]], and let us lay aside
these ridiculous pretences, that can never be wanting to any one that has
the impudence to allege them.”

arms have no more security than surnames.  i bear azure powdered with
trefoils or, with a lion’s paw of the same armed gules in fesse.  what
privilege has this to continue particularly in my house?  a son-in-law
will transport it into another [[family]], or some paltry purchaser will make
them his first arms.  there is nothing wherein there is more [[change]] and
confusion.

but this consideration leads me, perforce, into another [[subject]].  let us
pry a little narrowly into, and, in [[god’s]] name, examine upon what
foundation we erect this [[glory]] and [[reputation]] for which the [[world]] is
turned topsy-turvy: wherein do we place this renown that we hunt after
with so much pains [[pain]]?  it is, in the end, peter or william that carries it,
takes it into his possession, and whom it only concerns.  o what a
valiant faculty is [[hope]], that in a mortal [[subject]], and in a moment, makes
nothing of usurping infinity, immensity, eternity, and of supplying its
master’s indigence, at its [[pleasure]], with all things he can imagine or
desire!  [[nature]] has given us this passion for a pretty toy to play
withal.  and this peter or william, what is it but a sound, when all is
done? or three or four dashes with a pen, so easy to be varied that i
would fain [[know]] to whom is to be attributed the [[glory]] of so many
victories, to guesquin, to glesquin, or to gueaquin?  and yet there would
be something of greater moment in the case than in lucian, that sigma
should serve tau with a process; for

                         “non levia aut ludicra petuntur
                    praemia;”

     [“they aim at no slight or jocular rewards [[reward]].”--aeneid, xii. 764.]

the chase is there in very [[good]] earnest: the [[question]] is, which of these
letters is to be rewarded for so many sieges, battles [[battle]], wounds,
imprisonments, and services done to the [[crown]] of [[france]] by this famous
constable?  nicholas denisot--[painter and poet, born at le mans [[man]],1515.]--
never concerned himself further than the letters of his name, of which he
has altered the whole contexture to build up by anagram the count
d’alsinois, whom he has handsomely endowed with the [[glory]] of his poetry
and painting.  the historian suetonius was satisfied with only the
meaning of his name, which made him cashier his father’s surname, lenis,
to leave tranquillus successor to the [[reputation]] of his writings.  who
would [[believe]] that captain bayard should have no [[honour]] but what he
derives from the deeds of peter terrail; and that antonio iscalin should
suffer himself to his face to be robbed of the [[honour]] of so many
navigations and commands at sea and [[land]] by captain paulin and the baron
de la garde?  secondly, these are dashes of the pen [[common]] to a thousand
people.  how many are there, in every [[family]], of the same name and
surname? and how many more in several families [[family]], ages [[age]], and countries [[country]]?
history tells us of three of the name of [[socrates]], of five platos, of
eight aristotles, of seven xenophons, of twenty demetrii, and of twenty
theodores; and how many more she was not acquainted with we may imagine.
who hinders my groom from calling himself pompey the [[great]]?  but after
all, what [[virtue]], what [[authority]], or what secret springs are there that
fix upon my deceased groom, or the other pompey, who had his head cut off
in [[egypt]], this glorious renown, and these so much honoured flourishes of
the pen, so as to be of any advantage to them?

          “id cinerem et manes credis curare sepultos?”

     [“do you [[believe]] the [[dead]] regard such things?”--aeneid, iv. 34.]

what sense have the two companions in [[greatest]] esteem amongst me,
epaminondas, of this fine verse that has been so many ages [[age]] current in his
praise,

          “consiliis nostris laus est attrita laconum;”

     [“the [[glory]] of the spartans is extinguished by my plans.
     --“cicero, tusc. quaes., v. 17.]

or africanus, of this other,

          “a sole exoriente supra maeotis paludes
          nemo est qui factis me aequiparare queat.”

     [“from where the sun rises over the palus maeotis, to where it sets,
     there is no one whose acts can compare with mine”--idem, ibid.]

survivors indeed tickle themselves with these fine phrases, and by them
incited to [[jealousy]] and [[desire]], inconsiderately and according to their
own fancy, attribute to the [[dead]] this their own feeling, vainly
flattering themselves that they shall one day in turn be capable of the
same [[character]].  however:

                              “ad haec se
          romanus graiusque, et barbaras induperator
          erexit; caucus discriminis atque laboris
          inde habuit: tanto major famae sitis est, quam
          virtutis.”

     [“for these the roman, the [[greek]], and the barbarian commander hath
     aroused himself; he has incurred thence causes of danger and toil:
     so much greater is the thirst for fame than for [[virtue]].”
      --juvenal, x. 137.]




chapter xlvii

of the uncertainty of our judgment

well says this verse:

     [“there is everywhere much [[liberty]] of [[speech]].”--iliad, xx.  249.]

for [[example]]:

     [“hannibal conquered, but knew not how to make the [[best]] use of his
     victorious venture.”--petrarch, [[son]]., 83.]

such as would improve this argument, and condemn the oversight of our
leaders in not pushing [[home]] the [[victory]] at moncontour, or accuse the king
of [[spain]] of not knowing how to make the [[best]] use of the advantage he had
against us at st. quentin, may conclude these oversights to proceed from
a [[soul]] already drunk with [[success]], or from a spirit which, being full and
overgorged with this beginning of [[good]] [[fortune]], had lost the appetite of
adding to it, already having enough to do to digest what it had taken in:
he has his arms full, and can embrace no more: unworthy of the benefit
fortune has conferred upon him and the advantage she had put into his
hands: for what utility does he reap from it, if, notwithstanding, he
give his [[enemy]] respite to rally and make head against him?  what [[hope]] is
there that he will dare at another [[time]] to attack an [[enemy]] reunited and
recomposed, and armed anew with anger and [[revenge]], who did not dare to
pursue them when routed and unmanned by [[fear]]?

          “dum fortuna calet, dum conficit omnia terror.”

     [“whilst [[fortune]] is fresh, and terror finishes all.”
      --lucan, vii. 734.]

but withal, what [[better]] opportunity can he expect than that he has lost?
‘tis not here, as in fencing, where the most hits gain the prize; for so
long as the [[enemy]] is on foot, the game is new to begin, and that is not
to be called a [[victory]] that puts not an end to the [[war]].  in the encounter
where caesar had the worst, near the [[city]] of oricum, he reproached
pompey’s soldiers that he had been lost had their general known how to
overcome; and afterwards clawed him in a very different [[fashion]] when it
came to his turn.

but why may not a [[man]] also argue, on the contrary, that it is the effect
of a precipitous and insatiate spirit not to [[know]] how to bound and
restrain its coveting; that it is to [[abuse]] the favours of [[god]] to exceed
the measure he has prescribed them: and that again to throw a man’s self
into danger after a [[victory]] obtained is again to expose himself to the
mercy of [[fortune]]: that it is one of the [[greatest]] discretions in the rule
of [[war]] not to drive an [[enemy]] to despair?  sylla and marius in the social
war, having defeated the marsians, seeing yet a [[body]] of reserve that,
prompted by despair, was coming on like enraged brutes to dash in upon
them, [[thought]] it not convenient to stand their charge.  had not monsieur
de foix’s ardour transported him so furiously to pursue the remains of
the [[victory]] of ravenna, he had not obscured it by his own [[death]].  and yet
the recent memory of his [[example]] served to preserve monsieur d’anguien
from the same misfortune at the [[battle]] of serisoles.  ‘tis dangerous to
attack a [[man]] you have deprived of all means to escape but by his arms,
for necessity teaches [[teach]] [[violent]] resolutions:

          “gravissimi sunt morsus irritatae necessitatis.”

     [“irritated necessity bites deepest.”--portius latro., declam.]

          “vincitur haud gratis, jugulo qui provocat hostem.”

     [“he is not readily beaten who provokes the [[enemy]] by shewing
     his throat.”--or: “he who presents [[present]] himself to his foe, sells his
     [[life]] dear.”--lucan, iv. 275.]

this was it that made pharax withhold the [[king]] of lacedaemon, who had won
a [[battle]] against the mantineans, from going to charge a thousand argians,
who had escaped in an entire [[body]] from the defeat, but rather let them
steal off at [[liberty]] that he might not encounter valour whetted and
enraged by mischance.  clodomir, [[king]] of aquitaine, after his victory
pursuing gondemar, [[king]] of burgundy, beaten and making off as fast as he
could for safety, compelled him to face about and make head, wherein his
obstinacy deprived him of the fruit of his [[conquest]], for he there lost
his [[life]].

in like manner, if a [[man]] were to choose whether he would have his
soldiers richly and sumptuously accoutred or armed only for the necessity
of the matter in hand, this argument would step in to favour the first,
of which [[opinion]] was sertorius, philopcemen, brutus, caesar, and others,
that it is to a soldier an enflaming of [[courage]] and a spur himself in
brave attire; and withal a motive to be more obstinate in [[fight]], having
his arms, which are in a manner his estate and whole [[inheritance]] to
defend; which is the [[reason]], says xenophon, why those of [[asia]] carried
their wives [[wife]] and concubines, with their choicest jewels and greatest
wealth, along with them to the wars [[war]].  but then these arguments would be
as ready to stand up for the other side; that a general ought rather to
lessen in his [[men]] their solicitude of preserving themselves than to
increase it; that by such means they will be in a double [[fear]] of
hazarding their persons [[person]], as it will be a double temptation to the enemy
to [[fight]] with greater resolution where so [[great]] booty and so [[rich]] spoils
are to be obtained; and this very thing has been observed in former
times, notably to encourage the romans against the samnites.  antiochus,
shewing hannibal the [[army]] he had raised, wonderfully splendid and [[rich]] in
all sorts of equipage, [[asked]] him if the romans would be satisfied with
that [[army]]?  “satisfied,” replied the other, “yes, doubtless, were their
avarice never so [[great]].”  lycurgus not only forbad his soldiers all
manner of bravery in their equipage, but, moreover, to strip their
conquered enemies [[enemy]], because he would, as he said, that [[poverty]] and
frugality should shine with the rest of the [[battle]].

at sieges and elsewhere, where [[occasion]] draws us near to the [[enemy]], we
willingly suffer our [[men]] to brave, rate, and affront him with all sorts
of injurious [[language]]; and not without some colour of [[reason]]: for it is
of no little consequence to take from them all hopes [[hope]] of [[mercy]] and
composition, by representing to them that there is no [[fair]] quarter to be
expected from an [[enemy]] they have incensed to that [[degree]], nor other
remedy remaining but in [[victory]].  and yet vitellius found himself
deceived in this way of proceeding; for having to do with otho, weaker in
the valour of his soldiers, long unaccustomed to [[war]] and effeminated with
the delights of the [[city]], he so nettled them at [[last]] with injurious
language, reproaching them with cowardice and regret for the mistresses
and entertainments they had left behind at [[rome]], that by this means he
inspired them with such resolution as no exhortation had had the [[power]] to
have done, and himself made them fall upon him, with whom their own
captains before could by no means prevail.  and, indeed, when they are
injuries that touch to the quick, it may very well fall out that he who
went but unwillingly to [[work]] in the behalf of his [[prince]] will fall to’t
with another sort of mettle when the quarrel is his own.

considering of how [[great]] importance is the preservation of the general of
an [[army]], and that the universal aim of an [[enemy]] is levelled directly at
the head, upon which all the others depend, the course seems to admit of
no dispute, which we [[know]] has been taken by so many [[great]] captains, of
changing their habit and disguising their persons [[person]] upon the point of going
to engage.  nevertheless, the inconvenience a [[man]] by so doing runs into
is not less than that he thinks [[think]] to avoid; for the captain, by this means
being concealed from the [[knowledge]] of his own [[men]], the [[courage]] they
should derive from his presence and [[example]] happens by degrees [[degree]] to cool
and to decay; and not seeing the wonted marks and ensigns of their
leader, they presently conclude him either [[dead]], or that, despairing of
the [[business]], he is gone to shift for himself.  and [[experience]] shows us
that both these ways have been successful and otherwise.  what befell
pyrrhus in the [[battle]] he fought against the consul levinus in [[italy]] will
serve us to both purposes [[purpose]]; for though by shrouding his [[person]] under the
armour of megacles and making him wear his own, he undoubtedly preserved
his own [[life]], yet, by that very means, he was withal very near running
into the other mischief of losing the [[battle]].  alexander, caesar, and
lucullus loved to make themselves known in a [[battle]] by [[rich]] accoutrements
and armour of a particular lustre and colour: agis, agesilaus, and that
great gilippus, on the contrary, used to [[fight]] obscurely armed, and
without any imperial attendance or distinction.

amongst other oversights pompey is charged withal at the [[battle]] of
pharsalia, he is condemned for making his [[army]] stand still to receive the
enemy’s charge; by “reason that” (i shall here steal plutarch’s own
words, which are [[better]] than mine) “he by so doing deprived himself of
the [[violent]] impression the motion of running adds to the first shock of
arms, and hindered that clashing of the combatants against one another
which is wont to give them greater impetuosity and fury; especially when
they come to rush in with their utmost vigour, their courages increasing
by the shouts and the [[career]]; ‘tis to render the soldiers’ ardour, as a
man may say, more reserved and cold.”  this is what he says.  but if
caesar had come by the worse, why might it not as well have been urged by
another, that, on the contrary, the strongest and most steady posture of
fighting is that wherein a [[man]] stands planted firm without motion; and
that they who are steady upon the march, closing up, and reserving their
force within themselves for the push of the [[business]], have a great
advantage against those who are disordered, and who have already spent
half their breath in running on precipitately to the charge?  besides
that an [[army]] is a [[body]] made up of so many [[individual]] members, it is
impossible for it to move in this fury with so exact a motion as not to
break the order of [[battle]], and that the [[best]] of them are not engaged
before their fellows can come on to [[help]] them.  in that unnatural battle
betwixt the two persian brothers [[brother]], the lacedaemonian clearchus, who
commanded the greeks [[greek]] of cyrus’ party, [[led]] them on softly and without
precipitation to the charge; but, coming within fifty paces, hurried them
on full speed, hoping in so short a [[career]] both to keep their order and
to husband their breath, and at the same [[time]] to give the advantage of
impetuosity and impression both to their persons [[person]] and their missile arms.
others have regulated this [[question]] as to their armies [[army]] thus if your enemy
come full drive upon you, stand firm to receive him; if he stand to
receive you, run full drive upon him.

in the expedition of the [[emperor]] charles v. into provence, [[king]] francis
was put to choose either to go meet him in [[italy]] or to await him in his
own dominions; wherein, though he very well considered of how great
advantage it was to preserve his own territory entire and clear from the
troubles of [[war]], to the end that, being unexhausted of its stores, it
might continually supply [[men]] and [[money]] at need; that the necessity of war
requires at every turn to spoil and lay waste the [[country]] before us,
which cannot very well be done upon one’s own; to which may be added,
that the [[country]] [[people]] do not so easily digest such a havoc by those of
their own party as from an [[enemy]], so that seditions and commotions might
by such means be kindled amongst us; that the licence of pillage and
plunder (which are not to be tolerated at home) is a [[great]] ease and
refreshment against the fatigues and sufferings of [[war]]; and that he who
has no other prospect of gain than his bare [[pay]] will hardly be kept from
running [[home]], being but two steps from his [[wife]] and his own house; that
he who lays the cloth is ever at the charge of the feast; that there is
more alacrity in assaulting than defending; and that the shock of a
battle’s loss in our own bowels is so [[violent]] as to endanger the
disjointing of the whole [[body]], there being no passion so contagious as
that of [[fear]], that is so easily believed, or that so suddenly diffuses
itself; and that the cities [[city]] that should hear the rattle of this tempest
at their gates, that should take in their captains and soldiers yet
trembling and out of breath, would be in danger in this heat and hurry to
precipitate themselves upon some untoward resolution: notwithstanding all
this, so it was that he chose to recall the forces [[force]] he had beyond the
mountains and to suffer the [[enemy]] to come to him.  for he might, on the
other hand, imagine that, being at [[home]] and amongst his [[friends]], he could
not fail of plenty of all manner of conveniences; the rivers and passes
he had at his devotion would bring him in both provisions and [[money]] in
all security, and without the trouble of convoy; that he should find his
subjects by so much the more affectionate to him, by how much their
danger was more near and pressing; that having so many cities [[city]] and
barriers to secure him, it would be in his [[power]] to give the [[law]] of
battle at his own opportunity and advantage; and that, if it pleased him
to delay the [[time]], under cover and at his ease he might see his enemy
founder and defeat himself with the difficulties he was [[certain]] to
encounter, being engaged in a hostile [[country]], where before, behind, and
on every side [[war]] would be made upon him; no means to refresh himself or
to enlarge his quarters, should diseases infest them, or to lodge his
wounded [[men]] in safety; no [[money]], no victuals, but at the point of the
lance; no leisure to repose and take breath; no [[knowledge]] of the ways or
country to secure him from ambushes and surprises; and in case of losing
a [[battle]], no possible means of saving the remains.  neither is there want
of [[example]] in both these cases.

scipio [[thought]] it much [[better]] to go and attack his enemy’s territories in
africa than to stay at [[home]] to defend his own and to [[fight]] him in [[italy]],
and it succeeded well with him.  but, on the contrary, hannibal in the
same [[war]] ruined himself by abandoning the [[conquest]] of a [[foreign]] country
to go and defend his own.  the athenians having left the [[enemy]] in their
own dominions to go over into sicily, were not favoured by [[fortune]] in
their design; but agathocles, [[king]] of syracuse, found her favourable to
him when he went over into [[africa]] and left the [[war]] at [[home]].

by which examples [[example]] we are wont to conclude, and with some [[reason]], that
events, especially in [[war]], for the most part depend upon [[fortune]], who
will not be governed by nor submit unto [[human]] reasons [[reason]] and prudence,
according to the poet:

         “et male consultis pretium est: prudentia fallit
          nec [[fortune]] probat causas, sequiturque merentes,
          sed vaga per cunctos nullo discrimine fertur.
          scilicet est aliud, quod nos cogatque regatque
          majus, et in proprias ducat mortalia leges.”

     [“and there is value in ill counsel: prudence deceives: nor does
     [[fortune]] inquire into causes, nor aid the most deserving, but turns
     hither and thither without discrimination.  indeed there is a
     greater [[power]] which directs and rules [[rule]] us, and brings mortal affairs
     under its own laws [[law]].”--manilius, iv. 95.]

but, to take the thing [[right]], it should seem that our counsels and
deliberations depend as much upon [[fortune]] as anything else we do, and
that she engages also our arguments in her uncertainty and confusion.
“we argue rashly and adventurously,” says timaeus in [[plato]], “by reason
that, as well as ourselves, our discourses have [[great]] participation in
the temerity of [[chance]].”

chapter xlviii

of [[war]] horses, or destriers

i here have become a grammarian, i who never learned any [[language]] but by
rote, and who do not yet [[know]] adjective, conjunction, or ablative.  i
think i have [[read]] that the romans had a sort of horses by them called
‘funales’ or ‘dextrarios’, which were either [[led]] horses, or horses laid
on at several stages to be taken fresh upon [[occasion]], and thence it is
that we call our horses of service ‘destriers’; and our romances commonly
use the phrase of ‘adestrer’ for ‘accompagner’, to accompany.  they also
called those that were trained in such sort, that running full speed,
side by side, without bridle or saddle, the roman gentlemen, armed at all
pieces, would shift and throw themselves from one to the other,
‘desultorios equos’.  the numidian men-at-arms had always a [[led]] horse in
one hand, besides that they rode upon, to [[change]] in the heat of [[battle]]:

    “quibus, desultorum in modum, binos trahentibus equos, inter
     acerrimam saepe pugnam, in recentem equum, ex fesso, armatis
     transultare mos erat: tanta velocitas ipsis, tamque docile
     equorum genus.”

     [“to whom it was a custom, leading along two horses, often in the
     hottest [[fight]], to leap armed from a tired horse to a fresh one; so
     active were the [[men]], and the horses so docile.”--livy, xxiii. 29.]

there are many horses trained to [[help]] their riders so as to run upon any
one, that appears with a drawn [[sword]], to fall both with mouth and heels
upon any that front or oppose them: but it often happens that they do
more harm to their [[friends]] than to their enemies [[enemy]]; and, moreover, you
cannot loose them from their hold, to reduce them again into order, when
they are once engaged and grappled, by which means you remain at the
mercy of their quarrel.  it happened very ill to artybius, general of the
persian [[army]], fighting, [[man]] to [[man]], with onesilus, [[king]] of salamis, to be
mounted upon a horse trained after this manner, it being the [[occasion]] of
his [[death]], the squire of onesilus cleaving the horse down with a scythe
betwixt the shoulders as it was reared up upon his master.  and what the
italians report, that in the [[battle]] of fornova, the horse of charles
viii., with kicks and plunges, disengaged his master from the [[enemy]] that
pressed upon him, without which he had been slain, sounds like a very
great [[chance]], if it be true.

     [in the narrative which philip de commines has given of this [[battle]],
     in which he himself was [[present]] (lib. viii.  ch. 6), he tells us
     of wonderful performances by the horse on which the [[king]] was
     mounted.  the name of the horse was savoy, and it was the most
     beautiful horse he had ever seen.  during the [[battle]] the [[king]] was
     personally attacked, when he had nobody near him but a valet de
     chambre, a little fellow, and not well armed.  “the [[king]],” says
     commines, “had the [[best]] horse under him in the [[world]], and therefore
     he stood his ground bravely, till a number of his [[men]], not a great
     way from him, arrived at the critical minute.”]

the mamalukes make their boast that they have the most ready horses of
any cavalry in the [[world]]; that by [[nature]] and custom they were taught to
know and distinguish the [[enemy]], and to fall foul upon them with mouth and
heels, according to a word or sign given; as also to gather up with their
teeth darts and lances scattered upon the field, and [[present]] them to
their riders, on the word of command.  ‘t is said, both of caesar and
pompey, that amongst their other excellent qualities they were both very
good horsemen, and particularly of caesar, that in his [[youth]], being
mounted on the bare back, without saddle or bridle, he could make the
horse run, stop, and turn, and perform all its airs, with his hands
behind him.  as [[nature]] designed to make of this [[person]], and of alexander,
two [[miracles]] of [[military]] art [[arts]], so one would say she had done her utmost to
arm them after an extraordinary manner for every one knows [[know]] that
alexander’s horse, bucephalus, had a head inclining to the shape of a
bull; that he would suffer himself to be mounted and governed by none but
his master, and that he was so honoured after his [[death]] as to have a city
erected to his name.  caesar had also one which had forefeet like those
of a [[man]], his hoofs being divided in the form of fingers, which likewise
was not to be ridden, by any but caesar himself, who, after his [[death]],
dedicated his statue to the [[goddess]] [[venus]].

i do not willingly alight when i am once on horseback, for it is the
place where, whether well or sick, i find myself most at ease.  plato
recommends it for health, as also pliny says it is [[good]] for the stomach
and the joints.  let us go further into this matter since here we are.

we [[read]] in xenophon a [[law]] forbidding any one who was master of a horse to
travel on foot.  trogus pompeius and justin say that the parthians were
wont to perform all offices and ceremonies [[ceremony]], not only in [[war]] but also all
affairs whether [[public]] or private, make bargains, confer, entertain, take
the air, and all on horseback; and that the [[greatest]] distinction betwixt
freemen and slaves [[slave]] amongst them was that the one rode on horseback and
the other went on foot, an institution of which [[king]] cyrus was the
founder.

there are several examples [[example]] in the roman [[history]] (and suetonius more
particularly observes it of caesar) of captains who, on pressing
occasions, commanded their cavalry to alight, both by that means to take
from them all hopes [[hope]] of flight, as also for the advantage they hoped in
this sort of [[fight]].

               “quo baud dubie superat romanus,”

     [“wherein the roman does questionless excel.”--livy, ix. 22.]

says livy.  and so the first thing they did to prevent the mutinies and
insurrections of nations of late [[conquest]] was to take from them their
arms and horses, and therefore it is that we so often meet in caesar:

          “arma proferri, jumenta produci, obsides dari jubet.”

     [“he commanded the arms to be produced, the horses brought out,
     hostages to be given.”--de bello gall., vii. ii.]

the grand signior to this day suffers not a [[christian]] or a jew to keep a
horse of his own throughout his [[empire]].

our [[ancestors]], and especially at the [[time]] they had [[war]] with the english,
in all their [[greatest]] engagements and pitched battles [[battle]] fought for the most
part on foot, that they might have nothing but their own [[force]], [[courage]],
and constancy to trust to in a quarrel of so [[great]] concern as [[life]] and
honour.  you stake (whatever chrysanthes in xenophon says to the
contrary) your valour and your [[fortune]] upon that of your horse; his
wounds or [[death]] bring your [[person]] into the same danger; his [[fear]] or fury
shall make you reputed rash or cowardly; if he have an ill mouth or will
not [[answer]] to the spur, your [[honour]] must [[answer]] for it.  and, therefore,
i do not [[think]] it [[strange]] that those battles [[battle]] were more firm and furious
than those that are fought on horseback:

               “caedebant pariter, pariterque ruebant
          victores victique; neque his fuga nota, neque illis.”

     [“they fought and fell pell-mell, victors and vanquished; nor was
     flight [[thought]] of by either.”--aeneid, x. 756.]

their battles [[battle]] were much [[better]] disputed.  nowadays there are nothing but
routs:

          “primus clamor atque impetus rem decernit.”

     [“the first shout and charge decides the [[business]].”--livy, xxv. 41.]

and the means we choose to make use of in so [[great]] a hazard should be as
much as possible at our own command: wherefore i should advise to choose
weapons of the shortest sort, and such of which we are able to give the
best account.  a [[man]] may repose more confidence in a [[sword]] he holds in
his hand than in a bullet he discharges out of a pistol, wherein there
must be a concurrence of several circumstances to make it perform its
office, the powder, the stone, and the wheel: if any of which fail it
endangers your [[fortune]].  a [[man]] himself strikes much surer than the air
can direct his blow:

          “et, quo ferre velint, permittere vulnera ventis
          ensis habet vires; et gens quaecumque virorum est,
          bella gerit gladiis.”

     [“and so where they choose to carry [the arrows], the winds allow
     the wounds; the [[sword]] has [[strength]] of arm: and whatever nation of
     [[men]] there is, they wage [[war]] with swords [[sword]].”--lucan, viii. 384.]

but of that weapon i shall speak more fully when i come to compare the
arms of the ancients with those of [[modern]] use; only, by the way, the
astonishment of the ear abated, which every one grows familiar with in a
short [[time]], i look upon it as a weapon of very little execution, and hope
we shall one day lay it aside.  that missile weapon which the italians
formerly made use of both with [[fire]] and by sling was much more terrible:
they called a [[certain]] [[kind]] of javelin, armed at the point with an iron
three feet long, that it might pierce through and through an armed [[man]],
phalarica, which they sometimes in the field darted by hand, sometimes
from several sorts of engines for the defence of beleaguered places; the
shaft being rolled round with flax, wax, rosin, [[oil]], and other
combustible matter, took [[fire]] in its flight, and lighting upon the body
of a [[man]] or his target, took away all the use of arms and limbs.  and
yet, coming to close [[fight]], i should [[think]] they would also damage the
assailant, and that the camp being as it were planted with these flaming
truncheons, would [[produce]] a [[common]] inconvenience to the whole crowd:

          “magnum stridens contorta phalarica venit,
          fulminis acta modo.”

     [“the phalarica, launched like lightning, flies through
     the air with a loud rushing sound.”--aeneid, ix. 705.]

they had, moreover, other devices which custom made them [[perfect]] in
(which seem incredible to us who have not seen them), by which they
supplied the effects of our powder and shot.  they darted their spears
with so [[great]] [[force]], as ofttimes to transfix two targets and two armed
men at once, and pin them together.  neither was the effect of their
slings less [[certain]] of execution or of shorter carriage:

     [“culling round stones from the beach for their slings; and with
     these practising over the waves, so as from a [[great]] distance to
     throw within a very small circuit, they became able not only to
     wound an [[enemy]] in the head, but hit any other part at [[pleasure]].”
      --livy, xxxviii. 29.]

their pieces of battery had not only the execution but the thunder of our
cannon also:

          “ad ictus moenium cum terribili sonitu editos,
          pavor et trepidatio cepit.”

     [“at the battery of the walls, performed with a terrible noise,
     the defenders began to [[fear]] and tremble.”--idem, ibid., 5.]

the gauls, our kinsmen in [[asia]], abominated these [[treacherous]] missile
arms, it being their use to [[fight]], with greater bravery, hand to hand:

     [“they are not so much concerned about large gashes-the bigger and
     deeper the wound, the more glorious do they esteem the combat but
     when they find themselves tormented by some arrow-head or bullet
     lodged within, but presenting little outward show of wound,
     transported with shame and anger to perish by so imperceptible a
     destroyer, they fall to the ground.”---livy, xxxviii.  21.]

a pretty description of something very like an arquebuse-shot.  the ten
thousand greeks [[greek]] in their long and famous retreat met with a nation who
very much galled them with [[great]] and [[strong]] bows, carrying arrows so long
that, taking them up, one might return them back like a dart, and with
them pierce a buckler and an armed [[man]] through and through.  the engines,
that dionysius [[invented]] at syracuse to shoot vast massy darts and stones
of a prodigious greatness with so [[great]] impetuosity and at so [[great]] a
distance, came very near to our [[modern]] inventions.

but in this discourse of horses and horsemanship, we are not to forget
the pleasant posture of one maistre pierre pol, a doctor of divinity,
upon his mule, whom monstrelet reports always to have ridden sideways
through the streets of [[paris]] like a woman.  he says also, elsewhere, that
the gascons had terrible horses, that would wheel in their full speed,
which the french, picards, flemings, and brabanters looked upon as a
miracle, “having never seen the like before,” which are his very words.

caesar, speaking of the suabians: “in the charges they make on
horseback,” says he, “they often throw themselves off to [[fight]] on foot,
having taught their horses not to stir in the meantime from the place,
to which they presently run again upon [[occasion]]; and according to their
custom, nothing is so unmanly and so base as to use saddles or pads, and
they despise such as make use of those conveniences: insomuch that, being
but a very few in number, they [[fear]] not to attack a [[great]] many.”  that
which i have formerly wondered at, to see a horse made to perform all his
airs with a switch only and the reins upon his neck, was [[common]] with the
massilians, who rid their horses without saddle or bridle:

          “et gens, quae nudo residens massylia dorso,
          ora levi flectit, fraenorum nescia, virga.”

     [“the massylians, mounted on the bare backs of their horses,
     bridleless, guide them by a mere switch.”--lucan, iv.  682.]

               “et numidae infraeni cingunt.”

     [“the numidians guiding their horses without bridles.”
      --aeneid, iv.  41.]

          “equi sine fraenis, deformis ipse cursus,
          rigida cervice et extento capite currentium.”

     [“the [[career]] of a horse without a bridle is ungraceful; the neck
     extended stiff, and the nose thrust out.”--livy, xxxv. ii.]

king alfonso,--[alfonso xi., [[king]] of leon and castile, died 1350.]--
he who first instituted the order of the band or scarf in [[spain]], amongst
other rules [[rule]] of the order, gave them this, that they should never ride
mule or mulet, upon penalty of a mark of silver; this i had lately out of
guevara’s letters.  whoever gave these the title of golden epistles had
another [[kind]] of [[opinion]] of them than i have.  the courtier says, that
till his [[time]] it was a disgrace to a gentleman to ride on one of these
creatures: but the abyssinians, on the contrary, the nearer they are to
the [[person]] of prester john, [[love]] to be mounted upon large mules, for the
greatest [[dignity]] and grandeur.

xenophon tells us, that the assyrians were fain to keep their horses
fettered in the stable, they were so fierce and vicious; and that it
required so much [[time]] to loose and harness them, that to avoid any
disorder this tedious preparation might bring upon them in case of
surprise, they never sat down in their camp till it was first well
fortified with ditches and ramparts.  his cyrus, who was so [[great]] a
master in all manner of horse service, kept his horses to their due [[work]],
and never [[suffered]] them to have anything to [[eat]] till first they had
earned it by the sweat of some [[kind]] of exercise.  the scythians when in
the field and in scarcity of provisions used to let their horses [[blood]],
which they drank, and sustained themselves by that diet:

               “venit et epoto sarmata pastus equo.”

          [“the scythian comes, who feeds on horse-flesh”
           --martial, de spectaculis libey, epigr. iii. 4.]

those of crete, being besieged by metellus, were in so [[great]] necessity
for drink that they were fain to quench their thirst with their horses
urine.--[val.  max., vii. 6, ext. 1.]

to shew how much cheaper the turkish armies [[army]] support themselves than our
european forces [[force]], ‘tis said that besides the soldiers drink nothing but
water and [[eat]] nothing but rice and salt flesh pulverised (of which every
one may easily carry about with him a month’s provision), they [[know]] how
to feed upon the [[blood]] of their horses as well as the muscovite and
tartar, and salt it for their use.

these new-discovered [[people]] of the indies [mexico and yucatan  d.w.],
when the spaniards first landed amongst them, had so [[great]] an opinion
both of the [[men]] and horses, that they looked upon the first as gods and
the other as animals ennobled above their [[nature]]; insomuch that after
they were subdued, coming to the [[men]] to sue for [[peace]] and pardon, and to
bring them gold and provisions, they failed not to offer of the same to
the horses, with the same [[kind]] of harangue to them they had made to the
others: interpreting their neighing for a [[language]] of truce and
friendship.

in the other indies, to ride upon an elephant was the first and royal
place of [[honour]]; the second to ride in a coach with four horses; the
third to ride upon a camel; and the [[last]] and least [[honour]] to be carried
or drawn by one horse only.  some one of our late writers tells us that
he has been in countries [[country]] in those parts where they ride upon oxen with
pads, stirrups, and bridles, and very much at their ease.

quintus fabius maximus rullianus, in a [[battle]] with the samnites, seeing
his horse, after three or four charges, had failed of breaking into the
enemy’s battalion, took this course, to make them unbridle all their
horses and spur their hardest, so that having nothing to check their
career, they might through [[weapons]] and [[men]] open the way to his foot, who
by that means gave them a bloody defeat.  the same command was given by
quintus fulvius flaccus against the celtiberians:

     [“you will do your [[business]] with greater advantage of your horses’
     [[strength]], if you send them unbridled upon the [[enemy]], as it is
     recorded the roman horse to their [[great]] [[glory]] have often done; their
     bits being taken off, they charged through and again back through
     the enemy’s ranks with [[great]] slaughter, breaking down all their
     spears.”--idem, xl. 40.]

the duke of muscovy was anciently obliged to [[pay]] this reverence to the
tartars, that when they sent an embassy to him he went out to meet them
on foot, and presented them with a goblet of mares’ milk (a beverage of
greatest esteem amongst them), and if, in drinking, a drop fell by chance
upon their horse’s mane, he was bound to lick it off with his tongue.
the [[army]] that bajazet had sent into russia was overwhelmed with so
dreadful a tempest of snow, that to shelter and preserve themselves from
the cold, many killed and embowelled their horses, to creep into their
bellies and enjoy the benefit of that vital heat.  bajazet, after that
furious [[battle]] wherein he was overthrown by tamerlane,  was in a hopeful
way of securing his own [[person]] by the fleetness of an arabian mare he had
under him, had he not been constrained to let her drink her fill at the
ford of a river in his way, which rendered her so heavy and indisposed,
that he was afterwards easily overtaken by those that pursued him.  they
say, indeed, that to let a horse stale takes him off his mettle, but as
to drinking, i should rather have [[thought]] it would refresh him.

croesus, marching his [[army]] through [[certain]] waste lands [[land]] near sardis, met
with an infinite number of serpents, which the horses devoured with great
appetite, and which herodotus says was a prodigy of ominous portent to
his affairs.

we call a horse entire, that has his mane and ears so, and no other will
pass muster.  the lacedaemonians, having defeated the athenians in
sicily, returning triumphant from the [[victory]] into the [[city]] of syracuse,
amongst other insolences, caused all the horses they had taken to be
shorn and [[led]] in triumph.  alexander fought with a nation called dahas,
whose discipline it was to march two and two together armed on one horse,
to the [[war]]; and being in [[fight]], one of them alighted, and so they fought
on horseback and on foot, one after another by turns.

i do not [[think]] that for graceful riding any nation in the [[world]] excels
the french.  a [[good]] horseman, according to our way of speaking, seems
rather to have [[respect]] to the [[courage]] of the [[man]] than address in riding.
of all that ever i saw, the most knowing in that art [[arts]], who had the best
seat and the [[best]] method in breaking horses, was monsieur de carnavalet,
who served our [[king]] henry ii.

i have seen a [[man]] ride with both his feet upon the saddle, take off his
saddle, and at his return take it up again and replace it, riding all the
while full speed; having galloped over a cap, make at it very [[good]] shots
backwards with his bow; take up anything from the ground, setting one
foot on the ground and the other in the stirrup: with twenty other ape’s
tricks, which he got his living by.

there has been seen in my [[time]] at constantinople two [[men]] upon one horse,
who, in the height of its speed, would throw themselves off and into the
saddle again by turn; and one who bridled and saddled his horse with
nothing but his teeth; an other who betwixt two horses, one foot upon one
saddle and the other upon another, carrying the other [[man]] upon his
shoulders, would ride full [[career]], the other standing bolt upright upon
and making very [[good]] shots with his bow; several who would ride full
speed with their heels upward, and their heads upon the saddle betwixt
several scimitars, with the points upwards, fixed in the harness.  when i
was a boy, the [[prince]] of sulmona, riding an unbroken horse at naples,
prone to all sorts of action, held reals--[a small coin of [[spain]], the
two sicilies, &c.]--under his knees and toes, as if they had been nailed
there, to shew the firmness of his seat.




chapter xlix

of ancient customs

i should willingly pardon our [[people]] for admitting no other pattern or
rule of [[perfection]] than their own peculiar manners and customs; for ‘tis
a [[common]] [[vice]], not of the vulgar only, but almost of all [[men]], to walk in
the beaten road their [[ancestors]] have trod before them.  i am content,
when they see fabricius or laelius, that they look upon their countenance
and behaviour as barbarous, seeing they are neither clothed nor fashioned
according to our mode.  but i find [[fault]] with their singular indiscretion
in suffering themselves to be so blinded and imposed upon by the
authority of the [[present]] usage as every month to alter their [[opinion]], if
custom so require, and that they should so vary their [[judgment]] in their
own particular concern.  when they wore the busk of their doublets up as
high as their breasts, they stiffly maintained that they were in their
proper place; some years after it was slipped down betwixt their thighs,
and then they could laugh at the former [[fashion]] as uneasy and
intolerable.  the [[fashion]] now in use makes them absolutely condemn the
other two with so [[great]] resolution and so universal [[consent]], that a man
would [[think]] there was a [[certain]] [[kind]] of madness crept in amongst them,
that infatuates their understandings to this [[strange]] [[degree]].  now, seeing
that our [[change]] of fashions is so prompt and sudden, that the inventions
of all the tailors in the [[world]] cannot furnish out new whim-whams enow to
feed our vanity withal, there will often be a necessity that the despised
forms must again come in vogue, these immediately after fall into the
same contempt; and that the same [[judgment]] must, in the space of fifteen
or twenty years, take up half-a-dozen not only divers but contrary
opinions, with an incredible lightness and inconstancy; there is not any
of us so discreet, who suffers not himself to be gulled with this
contradiction, and both in external and internal sight to be insensibly
blinded.

i [[wish]] to muster up here some old customs that i have in memory, some of
them the same with ours, the others different, to the end that, bearing
in [[mind]] this continual variation of [[human]] things, we may have our
judgment more clearly and firmly settled.

the thing in use amongst us of fighting with rapier and cloak was in
practice amongst the romans also:

          “sinistras sagis involvunt, gladiosque distringunt,”

     [“they wrapt their cloaks upon the left arm, and drew their
     swords [[sword]].”--de bello civili, i. 75.]

says caesar; and he observes a vicious custom of our nation, that
continues yet amongst us, which is to stop passengers we meet upon the
road, to compel them to give an account who they are, and to take it for
an affront and just cause of quarrel if they refuse to do it.

at the baths, which the ancients made use of every day before they went
to dinner, and as frequently as we wash our hands, they at first only
bathed their arms and legs; but afterwards, and by a custom that has
continued for many ages [[age]] in most nations of the [[world]], they bathed stark
naked in mixed and perfumed water, looking upon it as a [[great]] simplicity
to bathe in mere water.  the most delicate and affected perfumed
themselves all over three or four times [[time]] a day.  they often caused their
hair to be pinched off, as the [[women]] of [[france]] have some [[time]] since taken
up a custom to do their foreheads,

          “quod pectus, quod crura tibi, quod brachia veilis,”

     [“you pluck the hairs out of your breast, your arms, and thighs.”
      --martial, ii.  62, i.]

though they had ointments proper for that [[purpose]]:

          “psilotro nitet, aut acids latet oblita creta.”

     [“she shines with unguents, or with chalk dissolved in vinegar.”
      --idem, vi.  93, 9.]

they delighted to [[lie]] soft, and alleged it as a [[great]] testimony of
hardiness to [[lie]] upon a mattress.  they ate lying upon beds, much after
the manner of the turks in this [[age]]:

          “inde thoro pater [[aeneas]] sic orsus ab alto.”

     [“thus [[father]] [[aeneas]], from his high bed of [[state]], spoke.”
      --aeneid, ii. 2.]

and ‘tis said of the younger cato, that after the [[battle]] of pharsalia,
being entered into a melancholy disposition at the ill posture of the
public affairs, he took his repasts always sitting, assuming a strict and
austere course of [[life]].  it was also their custom to kiss the hands of
great persons [[person]]; the more to [[honour]] and caress them.  and meeting with
friends, they always kissed in salutation, as do the venetians:

          “gratatusque darem cum dulcibus oscula verbis.”

          [“and kindest words i would mingle with kisses.”
           --ovid, de pont., iv. 9, 13]

in petitioning or saluting any [[great]] [[man]], they used to lay their hands
upon his knees.  pasicles the philosopher, [[brother]] of crates, instead of
laying his hand upon the knee laid it upon the private parts, and being
roughly repulsed by him to whom he made that indecent compliment:
“what,” said he, “is not that part your own as well as the other?”
 --[diogenes laertius, vi. 89.]--they used to [[eat]] fruit, as we do, after
dinner.  they wiped their fundaments (let the ladies [[lady]], if they please,
mince it smaller) with a sponge, which is the [[reason]] that ‘spongia’ is a
smutty word in latin; which sponge was fastened to the end of a stick, as
appears by the story of him who, as he was [[led]] along to be thrown to the
wild beasts in the sight of the [[people]], asking leave to do his [[business]],
and having no other way to despatch himself, forced the sponge and stick
down his throat and choked himself.--[seneca, ep., 70.] they used to
wipe, after coition, with perfumed wool:

          “at tibi nil faciam; sed iota mentula lana.”

they had in the streets of [[rome]] vessels and little tubs for passengers to
urine in:

          “pusi saepe lacum propter se, ac dolia curta.
          somno devincti, credunt extollere vestem.”

     [“the little boys in their sleep often [[think]] they are near the
     [[public]] urinal, and raise their coats to make use of it.”
      --lucretius, iv.]

they had collation betwixt meals, and had in summer cellars of snow to
cool their wine; and some there were who made use of snow in winter, not
thinking their wine cool enough, even at that cold season of the year.
the [[men]] of quality had their cupbearers and carvers, and their buffoons
to make them [[sport]].  they had their meat served up in winter upon chafing
dishes, which were set upon the table, and had portable kitchens (of
which i myself have seen some) wherein all their service was carried
about with them:

               “has vobis epulas habete, lauti
               nos offendimur ambulante caena.”

     [“do you, if you please, esteem these feasts: we do not like the
     ambulatory suppers.”--martial, vii. 48, 4.]

in summer they had a contrivance to bring fresh and clear rills through
their lower rooms, wherein were [[great]] store of living fish, which the
guests took out with their own hands to be dressed every [[man]] according to
his own liking.  fish has ever had this pre-eminence, and keeps it still,
that the grandees, as to them, all pretend to be cooks; and indeed the
taste is more delicate than that of flesh, at least to my fancy.  but in
all sorts of magnificence, debauchery, and voluptuous inventions of
effeminacy and expense, we do, in [[truth]], all we can to parallel them;
for our wills are as [[corrupt]] as theirs: but we want ability to equal
them.  our [[force]] is no more able to reach them in their vicious, than in
their [[virtuous]], qualities, for both the one and the other proceeded from
a vigour of [[soul]] which was without comparison greater in them than in us;
and souls [[soul]], by how much the weaker they are, by so much have they less
power to do either very well or very ill.

the highest place of [[honour]] amongst them was the middle.  the name going
before, or following after, either in writing or speaking, had no
signification of grandeur, as is evident by their writings; they will as
soon say oppius and caesar, as caesar and oppius; and me and thee, as
thee and me.  this is the [[reason]] that made me formerly take notice in the
life of flaminius, in our french plutarch, of one passage, where it seems
as if the author, speaking of the [[jealousy]] of [[honour]] betwixt the
aetolians and romans, about the winning of a [[battle]] they had with their
joined forces [[force]] obtained, made it of some importance, that in the greek
songs they had put the aetolians before the romans: if there be no
amphibology in the words of the french translation.

the ladies [[lady]], in their baths, made no scruple of admitting [[men]] amongst
them, and moreover made use of their serving-men to rub and anoint them:

          “inguina succinctus nigri tibi servus aluta
          stat, quoties calidis nuda foveris aquis.”

     [“a slave--his middle girded with a black apron--stands before you,
     when, naked, you take a hot bath.”--martial, vii. 35, i.]

they all powdered themselves with a [[certain]] powder, to moderate their
sweats.

the ancient gauls, says sidonius apollinaris, wore their hair long before
and the hinder part of the head shaved, a [[fashion]] that begins to revive
in this vicious and effeminate [[age]].

the romans used to [[pay]] the watermen their fare at their first stepping
into the boat, which we never do till after landing:

               “dum aes exigitur, dum mula ligatur,
               tota abit hora.”

     [“whilst the fare’s paying, and the mule is being harnessed, a whole
     hour’s [[time]] is [[past]].”--horace, sat. i. 5, 13.]

the [[women]] used to [[lie]] on the side of the bed next the wall: and for that
reason they called caesar,

                    “spondam regis nicomedis,”

     [“the bed of [[king]] nicomedes.”--suetonius, [[life]] of caesar, 49.]

they took breath in their drinking, and watered their wine

                   “quis puer ocius
                    restinguet ardentis falerni
                    pocula praetereunte lympha?”

     [“what boy will quickly come and cool the heat of the falernian
     wine with clear water?”--horace, od., ii. z, 18.]

and the roguish looks and gestures of our lackeys were also in use
amongst them:

          “o jane, a tergo quern nulls ciconia pinsit,
          nec manus, auriculas imitari est mobilis albas,
          nec lingua, quantum sitiat canis appula, tantum.”

     [“o janus, whom no crooked fingers, simulating a stork, peck at
     behind your back, whom no quick hands deride behind you, by
     imitating the motion of the [[white]] ears of the ass, against whom no
     mocking tongue is thrust out, as the tongue of the thirsty apulian
     dog.”--persius, i. 58.]

the argian and roman ladies [[lady]] mourned in [[white]], as ours did formerly and
should do still, were i to govern in this point.  but there are whole
books on this [[subject]].




chapter l

of democritus and heraclitus

the [[judgment]] is an utensil proper for all subjects [[subject]], and will have an oar
in everything: which is the [[reason]], that in these essays i take hold of
all occasions [[occasion]] where, though it happen to be a [[subject]] i do not very well
understand, i try, however, sounding it at a distance, and finding it too
deep for my stature, i keep me on the shore; and this [[knowledge]] that a
man can proceed no further, is one effect of its [[virtue]], yes, one of
those of which it is most proud.  one while in an idle and frivolous
subject, i try to find out matter whereof to compose a [[body]], and then to
prop and support it; another while, i employ it in a [[noble]] [[subject]], one
that has been tossed and tumbled by a thousand hands, wherein a [[man]] can
scarce possibly introduce anything of his own, the way being so beaten on
every side that he must of necessity walk in the steps of another: in
such a case, ‘tis the [[work]] of the [[judgment]] to take the way that seems
best, and of a thousand paths, to determine that this or that is the
best.  i leave the [[choice]] of my arguments to [[fortune]], and take that she
first presents [[present]] to me; they are all alike to me, i never design to go
through any of them; for i never see all of anything: neither do they who
so largely promise to show it others.  of a hundred members and faces
that everything has, i take one, onewhile to look it over only, another
while to ripple up the skin, and sometimes to pinch it to the bones: i
give a stab, not so wide but as deep as i can, and am for the most part
tempted to take it in hand by some new [[light]] i discover in it.  did i
know myself less, i might perhaps venture to handle something or other to
the bottom, and to be deceived in my own inability; but sprinkling here
one word and there another, patterns cut from several pieces and
scattered without design and without engaging myself too far, i am not
responsible for them, or obliged to keep close to my [[subject]], without
varying at my own [[liberty]] and [[pleasure]], and giving up myself to [[doubt]] and
uncertainty, and to my own governing method, ignorance.

all motion discovers us: the very same [[soul]] of caesar, that made itself
so conspicuous in marshalling and commanding the [[battle]] of pharsalia, was
also seen as solicitous and busy in the softer affairs of [[love]] and
leisure.  a [[man]] makes a [[judgment]] of a horse, not only by seeing him when
he is showing off his paces, but by his very walk, nay, and by seeing him
stand in the stable.

amongst the functions of the [[soul]], there are some of a lower and meaner
form; he who does not see her in those inferior offices as well as in
those of nobler note, never fully discovers her; and, peradventure, she
is [[best]] shown where she moves her simpler pace.  the winds of passions
take most hold of her in her highest flights; and the rather by reason
that she wholly applies herself to, and exercises her whole [[virtue]] upon,
every particular [[subject]], and never handles more than one thing at a
time, and that not according to it, but according to herself.  things in
respect to themselves have, peradventure, their weight, measures, and
conditions; but when we once take them into us, the [[soul]] forms them as
she pleases.  [[death]] is terrible to cicero, coveted by cato, indifferent
to [[socrates]].  health, [[conscience]], [[authority]], [[knowledge]], riches [[rich]], [[beauty]],
and their contraries, all strip themselves at their entering into us, and
receive a new robe, and of another [[fashion]], from the [[soul]]; and of what
colour, brown, bright, green, dark, and of what quality, sharp, sweet,
deep, or superficial, as [[best]] pleases each of them, for they are not
agreed upon any [[common]] standard of forms, rules [[rule]], or proceedings; every
one is a queen in her own dominions.  let us, therefore, no more excuse
ourselves upon the external qualities of things; it belongs to us to give
ourselves an account of them.  our [[good]] or ill has no other dependence
but on ourselves.  ‘tis there that our offerings and our vows are due,
and not to [[fortune]] she has no [[power]] over our manners; on the contrary,
they draw and make her [[follow]] in their train, and cast her in their own
mould.  why should not i [[judge]] of alexander at table, ranting and
drinking at the prodigious rate he sometimes used to do?

or, if he played at chess?  what string of his [[soul]] was not touched by
this idle and childish game?  i hate and avoid it, because it is not play
enough, that it is too grave and serious a diversion, and i am ashamed to
lay out as much [[thought]] and study upon it as would serve to much better
uses.  he did not more pump his brains about his glorious expedition into
the indies, nor than another in unravelling a passage upon which depends
the safety of [[mankind]].  to what a [[degree]] does this ridiculous diversion
molest the [[soul]], when all her faculties are summoned together upon this
trivial account! and how [[fair]] an opportunity she herein gives every one
to [[know]] and to make a [[right]] [[judgment]] of himself?  i do not more
thoroughly sift myself in any other posture than this: what passion are
we exempted from in it?  anger, spite, malice, [[impatience]], and a vehement
desire of getting the [[better]] in a concern wherein it were more excusable
to be ambitious of being overcome; for to be eminent, to excel above the
common rate in frivolous things, nowise befits a [[man]] of [[honour]].  what i
say in this [[example]] may be said in all others.  every particle, every
employment of [[man]] manifests him equally with any other.

democritus and heraclitus were two [[philosophers]], of whom the first,
finding [[human]] condition ridiculous and [[vain]], never appeared abroad but
with a jeering and laughing countenance; whereas heraclitus commiserating
that same condition of ours, appeared always with a sorrowful look, and
tears in his [[eyes]]:

               “alter
               ridebat, quoties a limine moverat unum
               protuleratque pedem; flebat contrarius alter.”

     [“the one always, as often as he had stepped one pace from his
     threshold, laughed, the other always wept.”--juvenal, sat., x. 28.]

          [or, as voltaire: “life is a comedy to those who [[think]];
          a tragedy to those who [[feel]].”  d.w.]

i am clearly for the first [[humour]]; not because it is more pleasant to
laugh than to weep, but because it expresses more contempt and
condemnation than the other, and i [[think]] we can never be despised
according to our full desert.  compassion and bewailing seem to imply
some esteem of and value for the thing bemoaned; whereas the things we
laugh at are by that expressed to be of no moment.  i do not [[think]] that
we are so unhappy as we are [[vain]], or have in us so much malice as folly;
we are not so full of mischief as inanity; nor so miserable as we are
vile and mean.  and therefore diogenes, who passed away his [[time]] in
rolling himself in his tub, and made nothing of the [[great]] alexander,
esteeming us no [[better]] than flies or bladders puffed up with wind, was a
sharper and more penetrating, and, consequently in my [[opinion]], a juster
judge than timon, surnamed the man-hater; for what a [[man]] hates he lays to
heart.  this [[last]] was an [[enemy]] to all [[mankind]], who passionately desired
our ruin, and avoided our conversation as dangerous, proceeding from
wicked and depraved natures [[nature]]: the other valued us so little that we could
neither trouble nor infect him by our [[example]]; and left us to herd one
with another, not out of [[fear]], but from contempt of our [[society]]:
concluding us as incapable of doing [[good]] as [[evil]].

of the same strain was statilius’ [[answer]], when brutus courted him into
the conspiracy against caesar; he was satisfied that the enterprise was
just, but he did not [[think]] [[mankind]] worthy of a [[wise]] man’s concern’;
according to the doctrine of hegesias, who said, that a [[wise]] [[man]] ought to
do nothing but for himself, forasmuch as he only was worthy of it: and to
the saying of theodorus, that it was not reasonable a [[wise]] [[man]] should
hazard himself for his [[country]], and endanger [[wisdom]] for a company of
fools.  our condition is as ridiculous as risible.




chapter li

of the vanity of words

a rhetorician of times [[time]] [[past]] said, that to make little things appear great
was his profession.  this was a shoemaker, who can make a [[great]] shoe for
a little foot.--[a saying of agesilaus.]--they would in sparta have
sent such a fellow to be whipped for making profession of a tricky and
deceitful act; and i fancy that archidamus, who was [[king]] of that [[country]],
was a little surprised at the [[answer]] of thucydides, when inquiring of
him, which was the [[better]] wrestler, pericles, or he, he replied, that it
was hard to affirm; for when i have thrown him, said he, he always
persuades the spectators that he had no fall and carries away the prize.
--[quintilian, ii.  15.]--the [[women]] who paint, pounce, and plaster up
their ruins, filling up their wrinkles and deformities, are less to
blame, because it is no [[great]] matter whether we see them in their natural
complexions; whereas these make it their [[business]] to [[deceive]] not our
sight only but our judgments [[judgment]], and to adulterate and [[corrupt]] the very
essence of things.  the republics [[republic]] that have maintained themselves in a
regular and well-modelled [[government]], such as those of lacedaemon and
crete, had orators in no very [[great]] esteem.  aristo wisely defined
rhetoric to be “a [[science]] to persuade the [[people]];” [[socrates]] and plato
“an art [[arts]] to flatter and [[deceive]].”  and those who deny it in the general
description, verify it throughout in their precepts.  the mohammedans
will not suffer their [[children]] to be instructed in it, as being useless,
and the athenians, perceiving of how pernicious consequence the practice
of it was, it being in their [[city]] of universal esteem, ordered the
principal part, which is to move the affections, with their exordiums and
perorations, to be taken away.  ‘tis an engine [[invented]] to manage and
govern a disorderly and tumultuous rabble, and that never is made use of,
but like physic to the sick, in a discomposed [[state]].  in those where the
vulgar or the ignorant, or both together, have been all-powerful and able
to give the [[law]], as in those of [[athens]], rhodes, and [[rome]], and where the
public affairs have been in a continual tempest of commotion, to such
places have the orators always repaired.  and in [[truth]], we shall find few
persons in those republics [[republic]] who have pushed their fortunes [[fortune]] to any great
degree of eminence without the assistance of eloquence.

pompey, caesar, crassus, lucullus, lentulus, metellus, thence took their
chiefest spring, to mount to that [[degree]] of [[authority]] at which they at
last arrived, making it of greater use to them than arms, contrary to the
opinion of [[better]] times [[time]]; for, l. volumnius speaking publicly in favour of
the election of q. fabius and pub. decius, to the consular [[dignity]]:
“these are [[men]],” said he, “born for [[war]] and [[great]] in execution; in the
combat of the tongue altogether wanting; spirits truly consular.  the
subtle, eloquent, and learned are only [[good]] for the [[city]], to make
praetors of, to administer [[justice]].”--[livy, x. 22.]

eloquence most flourished at [[rome]] when the [[public]] affairs were in the
worst condition and most disquieted with intestine commotions; as a free
and untilled soil bears the worst weeds.  by which it should seem that a
monarchical [[government]] has less need of it than any other: for the
stupidity and facility [[natural]] to the [[common]] [[people]], and that render them
subject to be turned and twined and, [[led]] by the ears by this charming
harmony of words, without weighing or considering the [[truth]] and reality
of things by the [[force]] of [[reason]]: this facility, i say, is not easily
found in a [[single]] [[person]], and it is also more easy by [[good]] [[education]] and
advice to secure him from the impression of this poison.  there was never
any famous orator known to come out of [[persia]] or macedon.

i have entered into this discourse upon the [[occasion]] of an italian i
lately received into my service, and who was clerk of the kitchen to the
late cardinal caraffa till his [[death]].  i put this fellow upon an account
of his office: when he fell to discourse of this palate-science, with
such a settled countenance and magisterial gravity, as if he had been
handling some profound point of divinity.  he made a learned distinction
of the several sorts of appetites; of that a [[man]] has before he begins to
eat, and of those after the second and third service; the means simply to
satisfy the first, and then to raise and actuate the other two; the
ordering of the sauces, first in general, and then proceeded to the
qualities of the ingredients and their effects; the differences of salads
according to their seasons, those which ought to be served up hot, and
which cold; the manner of their garnishment and decoration to render them
acceptable to the eye.  after which he entered upon the order of the
whole service, full of weighty and important considerations:

               “nec minimo sane discrimine refert,
               quo gestu lepores, et quo gallina secetur;”

     [“nor with less discrimination observes how we should carve a hare,
     and how a hen.” or, (“nor with the least discrimination relates how
     we should carve hares, and how cut up a hen.)”
      --juvenal, sat., v. 123.]

and all this set out with lofty and magnificent words, the very same we
make use of when we discourse of the [[government]] of an [[empire]].  which
learned lecture of my [[man]] brought this of terence into my memory:

         “hoc salsum est, hoc adustum est, hoc lautum est, parum:
          illud recte: iterum sic memento: sedulo
          moneo, qux possum, pro mea sapientia.
          postremo, tanquam in speculum, in patinas,
          demea, inspicere jubeo, et moneo, quid facto usus sit.”

     [“this is too salt, that’s burnt, that’s not washed enough; that’s
     well; [[remember]] to do so another [[time]].  thus do i ever advise them to
     have things done properly, according to my capacity; and lastly,
     demea, i command my cooks to look into every dish as if it were a
     mirror, and tell them what they should do.”
      --terence, adelph., iii. 3, 71.]

and yet even the greeks [[greek]] themselves very much admired and highly applauded
the order and disposition that paulus aemilius observed in the feast he
gave them at his return from macedon.  but i do not here speak of
effects, i speak of words only.

i do not [[know]] whether it may have the same operation upon other [[men]] that
it has upon me, but when i hear our architects thunder out their bombast
words of pilasters, architraves, and cornices, of the corinthian and
doric orders, and suchlike jargon, my [[imagination]] is presently possessed
with the palace of apollidon; when, after all, i find them but the paltry
pieces of my own kitchen door.

to hear [[men]] talk of metonomies, metaphors, and allegories, and other
grammar words, would not one [[think]] they signified some rare and exotic
form of speaking?  and yet they are phrases that come near to the babble
of my chambermaid.

and this other is a gullery of the same stamp, to call the offices of our
kingdom by the lofty titles of the romans, though they have no similitude
of function, and still less of [[authority]] and [[power]].  and this also, which
i [[doubt]] will one day turn to the reproach of this [[age]] of ours, unworthily
and indifferently to confer upon any we [[think]] fit the most glorious
surnames with which antiquity honoured but one or two persons [[person]] in several
ages.  [[plato]] carried away the surname of [[divine]], by so universal a
consent that never any one repined at it, or attempted to take it from
him; and yet the italians, who pretend, and with [[good]] [[reason]], to more
sprightly wits and sounder sense than the other nations of their [[time]],
have lately bestowed the same title upon aretin, in whose writings, save
tumid phrases set out with smart periods, ingenious indeed but
far-fetched and fantastic, and the eloquence, be it what it may, i see
nothing in him above the ordinary writers of his [[time]], so far is he from
approaching the ancient divinity.  and we make nothing of giving the
surname of [[great]] to princes [[prince]] who have nothing more than ordinary in them.




chapter lii

of the parsimony of the ancients

attilius regulus, general of the roman [[army]] in [[africa]], in the height of
all his [[glory]] and victories [[victory]] over the carthaginians, wrote to the republic
to acquaint them that a [[certain]] hind he had left in trust with his
estate, which was in all but seven acres of [[land]], had run away with all
his instruments of husbandry, and entreating therefore, that they would
please to call him [[home]] that he might take order in his own affairs, lest
his [[wife]] and [[children]] should suffer by this disaster.  whereupon the
senate appointed another to manage his [[business]], caused his losses to be
made [[good]], and ordered his [[family]] to be maintained at the [[public]] expense.

the elder cato, returning consul from [[spain]], sold his warhorse to save
the [[money]] it would have cost in bringing it back by sea into [[italy]]; and
being governor of sardinia, he made all his visits on foot, without other
train than one officer of the [[republic]] who carried his robe and a censer
for sacrifices [[sacrifice]], and for the most part carried his trunk himself.  he
bragged that he had never worn a gown that cost above ten crowns [[crown]], nor had
ever sent above tenpence to the market for one day’s provision; and that
as to his [[country]] houses, he had not one that was rough-cast on the
outside.

scipio aemilianus, after two triumphs and two consulships, went an
embassy with no more than seven servants in his train.  ‘tis said that
homer had never more than one, [[plato]] three, and zeno, founder of the sect
of stoics, none at all.  tiberius gracchus was allowed but fivepence
halfpenny a day when employed as [[public]] minister about the public
affairs, and being at that [[time]] the [[greatest]] [[man]] of [[rome]].




chapter liii

of a saying of caesar

if we would sometimes bestow a little consideration upon ourselves, and
employ the [[time]] we spend in prying into other [[men’s]] actions, and
discovering things without us, in examining our own abilities we should
soon perceive of how infirm and decaying material this fabric of ours is
composed.  is it not a singular testimony of imperfection that we cannot
establish our satisfaction in any one thing, and that even our own fancy
and [[desire]] should deprive us of the [[power]] to choose what is most proper
and useful for us?  a very [[good]] proof of this is the [[great]] dispute that
has ever been amongst the [[philosophers]], of finding out man’s sovereign
good, that continues yet, and will eternally continue, without solution
or accord:

              “dum abest quod avemus, id exsuperare videtur
               caetera; post aliud, quum contigit illud, avemus,
               et sitis aequa tenet.”

     [“while that which we [[desire]] is wanting, it seems to surpass all the
     rest; then, when we have got it, we want something else; ‘tis ever
     the same thirst”--lucretius, iii. 1095.]

whatever it is that falls into our [[knowledge]] and possession, we find that
it satisfies not, and we still pant after things to come and unknown,
inasmuch as those [[present]] do not suffice for us; not that, in my
judgment, they have not in them wherewith to do it, but because we seize
them with an unruly and immoderate haste:

         “nam quum vidit hic, ad victum qux flagitat usus,
          et per quae possent vitam consistere tutam,
          omnia jam ferme mortalibus esse parata;
          divitiis homines, et honore, et laude potentes
          aflluere, atque bona natorum excellere fama;
          nec minus esse domi cuiquam tamen anxia corda,
          atque animi ingratis vitam vexare querelis
          causam, quae infestis cogit saevire querelis,
          intellegit ibi; vitium vas efficere ipsum,
          omniaque, illius vitio, corrumpier intus,
          qux collata foris et commoda quomque venirent.”

     [“for when he saw that almost all things necessarily required for
     subsistence, and which may render [[life]] comfortable, are already
     prepared to their hand, that [[men]] may abundantly attain [[wealth]],
     [[honour]], [[praise]], may rejoice in the [[reputation]] of their [[children]], yet
     that, notwithstanding, every one has none the less in his [[heart]] and
     [[home]] anxieties and a [[mind]] enslaved by wearing complaints, he saw
     that the vessel itself was in [[fault]], and that all [[good]] things which
     were brought into it from without were spoilt by its own
     imperfections.”--lucretius, vi. 9.]

our appetite is irresolute and fickle; it can neither keep nor enjoy
anything with a [[good]] grace: and [[man]] concluding it to be the [[fault]] of the
things he is possessed of, fills himself with and feeds upon the [[idea]] of
things he neither knows [[know]] nor understands, to which he devotes his hopes
and his desires [[desire]], paying them all reverence and [[honour]], according to the
saying of caesar:

          “communi fit vitio naturae, ut invisis, latitantibus
          atque incognitis rebus magis confidamas,
          vehementiusque exterreamur.”

     [“‘tis the [[common]] [[vice]] of [[nature]], that we at once repose most
     confidence, and receive the [[greatest]] apprehensions, from things
     unseen, concealed, and unknown.”--de bello civil, xi. 4.]




chapter liv

of [[vain]] subtleties

there are a sort of little knacks and frivolous subtleties from which men
sometimes expect to derive [[reputation]] and applause: as poets, who compose
whole poems with every line beginning with the same letter; we see the
shapes of eggs, globes, wings, and hatchets cut out by the ancient greeks
by the measure of their verses, making them longer or shorter, to
represent such or such a figure.  of this [[nature]] was his employment who
made it his [[business]] to compute into how many several orders the letters
of the alphabet might be transposed, and found out that incredible number
mentioned in plutarch.  i am mightily pleased with the [[humour]] of him,

     [“alexander, as may be seen in quintil., institut.  orat., lib.
     ii., cap. 20, where he defines maratarexvia to be a certain
     unnecessary imitation of art [[arts]], which really does neither [[good]] nor
     harm, but is as unprofitable and ridiculous as was the [[labour]] of
     that [[man]] who had so perfectly learned to cast small peas through the
     eye of a needle at a [[good]] distance that he never missed one, and was
     justly rewarded for it, as is said, by alexander, who saw the
     performance, with a bushel of peas.”--coste.]

who having a [[man]] brought before him that had learned to throw a grain of
millet with such dexterity and assurance as never to miss the eye of a
needle; and being afterwards entreated to give something for the reward
of so rare a performance, he pleasantly, and in my [[opinion]] justly,
ordered a [[certain]] number of bushels of the same grain to be delivered to
him, that he might not want wherewith to exercise so famous an art [[arts]].  ‘tis
a [[strong]] evidence of a [[weak]] [[judgment]] when [[men]] approve of things for their
being rare and new, or for their difficulty, where worth and usefulness
are not conjoined to recommend them.

i come just now from playing with my own [[family]] at who could find out the
most things that hold by their two extremities; as sire, which is a title
given to the [[greatest]] [[person]] in the nation, the [[king]], and also to the
vulgar, as merchants, but never to any [[degree]] of [[men]] between.  the women
of [[great]] quality are called dames, inferior gentlewomen, demoiselles, and
the meanest sort of [[women]], dames, as the first.  the cloth of [[state]] over
our tables is not permitted but in the palaces of princes [[prince]] and in taverns.
democritus said, that gods and beasts had sharper sense than [[men]], who are
of a middle form.  the romans wore the same habit at funerals and feasts.
it is most [[certain]] that an extreme [[fear]] and an extreme ardour of courage
equally trouble and relax the belly.  the nickname of trembling with
which they surnamed sancho xii., [[king]] of navarre, tells us that valour
will cause a trembling in the limbs as well as [[fear]].  those who were
arming that [[king]], or some other [[person]], who upon the like [[occasion]] was
wont to be in the same disorder, tried to compose him by representing the
danger less he was going to engage himself in: “you [[understand]] me ill,”
 said he, “for could my flesh [[know]] the danger my [[courage]] will presently
carry it into, it would sink down to the ground.”  the faintness that
surprises us from frigidity or dislike in the exercises of [[venus]] are also
occasioned by a too [[violent]] [[desire]] and an immoderate heat.  extreme
coldness and extreme heat boil and roast.  [[aristotle]] says, that sows of
lead will melt and run with cold and the rigour of winter just as with a
vehement heat.  [[desire]] and satiety fill all the gradations above and
below [[pleasure]] with [[pain]].  stupidity and [[wisdom]] meet in the same centre
of sentiment and resolution, in the suffering of [[human]] accidents.  the
wise control and triumph over ill, the others [[know]] it not: these last
are, as a [[man]] may say, on this side of accidents, the others are beyond
them, who after having well weighed and considered their qualities,
measured and judged them what they are, by [[virtue]] of a vigorous [[soul]] leap
out of their reach; they disdain and trample them underfoot, having a
solid and well-fortified [[soul]], against which the darts of [[fortune]], coming
to strike, must of necessity rebound and blunt themselves, meeting with a
body upon which they can fix no impression; the ordinary and middle
condition of [[men]] are lodged betwixt these two extremities, consisting of
such as perceive evils [[evil]], [[feel]] them, and are not able to support them.
infancy and decrepitude meet in the imbecility of the brain; avarice and
profusion in the same thirst and [[desire]] of getting.

a [[man]] may say with some colour of [[truth]] that there is an abecedarian
ignorance that precedes [[knowledge]], and a doctoral ignorance that comes
after it: an ignorance that [[knowledge]] creates and begets, at the same
time that it despatches and destroys the first.  of mean understandings,
little inquisitive, and little instructed, are made [[good]] christians [[christian]], who
by reverence and [[obedience]] simply [[believe]] and are constant in their
belief.  in the average understandings and the middle sort of capacities,
the error of [[opinion]] is begotten; they [[follow]] the appearance of the first
impression, and have some colour of [[reason]] on their side to impute our
walking on in the old beaten path to simplicity and stupidity, meaning us
who have not informed ourselves by study.  the higher and nobler souls [[soul]],
more solid and clear-sighted, make up another sort of true believers, who
by a long and [[religious]] investigation of [[truth]], have obtained a clearer
and more penetrating [[light]] into the scriptures [[scripture]], and have discovered the
mysterious and [[divine]] secret of our ecclesiastical polity; and yet we see
some, who by the middle step, have arrived at that supreme [[degree]] with
marvellous fruit and confirmation, as to the utmost limit of christian
intelligence, and enjoy their [[victory]] with [[great]] [[spiritual]] consolation,
humble acknowledgment of the [[divine]] favour, reformation of manners, and
singular modesty.  i do not intend with these to rank those others, who
to clear themselves from all suspicion of their former errors and to
satisfy us that they are sound and firm, render themselves extremely
indiscreet and [[unjust]], in the carrying on our cause, and blemish it with
infinite reproaches of [[violence]] and oppression.  the simple peasants are
good [[people]], and so are the [[philosophers]], or whatever the [[present]] age
calls them, [[men]] of [[strong]] and clear [[reason]], and whose souls [[soul]] are enriched
with an ample instruction of profitable sciences [[science]].  the mongrels who have
disdained the first form of the ignorance of letters, and have not been
able to attain to the other (sitting betwixt two stools, as i and a great
many more of us do), are dangerous, foolish, and importunate; these are
they that trouble the [[world]].  and therefore it is that i, for my own
part, retreat as much as i can towards the first and [[natural]] station,
whence i so vainly attempted to advance.

popular and purely [[natural]] poesy

     [“the term poesie populaire was employed, for the first [[time]], in the
     french [[language]] on this [[occasion]].  montaigne created the expression,
     and indicated its [[nature]].”--ampere.]

has in it [[certain]] artless graces, by which she may come into comparison
with the [[greatest]] [[beauty]] of poetry perfected by art [[arts]]: as we see in our
gascon villanels and the songs [[song]] that are brought us from nations that have
no [[knowledge]] of any manner of [[science]], nor so much as the use of writing.
the middle sort of poesy betwixt these two is despised, of no value,
honour, or esteem.

but seeing that the path once laid open to the fancy, i have found, as it
commonly falls out, that what we have taken for a difficult exercise and
a rare [[subject]], prove to be nothing so, and that after the invention is
once warm, it finds out an infinite number of parallel examples [[example]].  i shall
only add this one--that, were these essays of mine considerable enough to
deserve a critical [[judgment]], it might then, i [[think]], fall out that they
would not much take with [[common]] and vulgar capacities, nor be very
acceptable to the singular and excellent sort of [[men]]; the first would not
understand them enough, and the [[last]] too much; and so they may hover in
the middle region.



chapter lv

of smells

it has been reported of some, as of alexander the [[great]], that their sweat
exhaled an odoriferous smell, occasioned by some rare and extraordinary
constitution, of which plutarch and others have been inquisitive into the
cause.  but the ordinary [[constitution]] of [[human]] bodies [[body]] is quite otherwise,
and their [[best]] and chiefest excellency is to be exempt from smell.  nay,
the sweetness even of the purest breath has nothing in it of greater
perfection than to be without any offensive smell, like those of
healthful [[children]], which made plautus say of a woman:

               “mulier tum bene olet, ubi nihil olet.”

          [“she smells sweetest, who smells not at all.”
           --plautus, mostel, i. 3, 116.]

and such as make use of fine exotic perfumes are with [[good]] [[reason]] to be
suspected of some [[natural]] imperfection which they endeavour by these
odours to conceal.  to smell, though well, is to stink:

              “rides nos, coracine, nil olentes
               malo, quam bene olere, nil olere.”

     [“you laugh at us, coracinus, because we are not scented; i would,
     rather than smell well, not smell at all.”--martial, vi. 55, 4.]

and elsewhere:

          “posthume, non bene olet, qui bene semper olet.”

     [“posthumus, he who ever smells well does not smell well.”
      --idem, ii. 12, 14.]

i am nevertheless a [[great]] lover of [[good]] smells, and as much abominate the
ill ones, which also i scent at a greater distance, i [[think]], than other
men:

              “namque sagacius unus odoror,
               polypus, an gravis hirsutis cubet hircus in aliis
               quam canis acer, ubi latest sus.”

     [“my nose is quicker to scent a fetid sore or a rank armpit, than a
     dog to smell out the hidden sow.”--horace, epod., xii.  4.]

of smells, the simple and [[natural]] seem to me the most pleasing.  let the
ladies look to that, for ‘tis chiefly their concern: amid the most
profound barbarism, the scythian [[women]], after bathing, were wont to
powder and crust their faces and all their bodies [[body]] with a certain
odoriferous drug growing in their [[country]], which being cleansed off, when
they came to have familiarity with [[men]] they were found perfumed and
sleek.  ‘tis not to be believed how strangely all sorts of odours cleave
to me, and how apt my skin is to imbibe them.  he that complains of
nature that she has not furnished [[mankind]] with a vehicle to convey smells
to the nose had no [[reason]]; for they will do it themselves, especially to
me; my very mustachios, which are full, perform that office; for if i
stroke them but with my gloves or handkerchief, the smell will not out a
whole day; they manifest where i have been, and the close, luscious,
devouring, viscid melting kisses of youthful ardour in my wanton [[age]] left
a sweetness upon my lips for several hours after.  and yet i have ever
found myself little [[subject]] to epidemic diseases, that are caught, either
by conversing with the sick or bred by the contagion of the air, and have
escaped from those of my [[time]], of which there have been several sorts in
our cities [[city]] and armies [[army]].  we [[read]] of [[socrates]], that though he never
departed from [[athens]] during the frequent plagues that infested the [[city]],
he only was never infected.

physicians might, i [[believe]], extract greater utility from odours than
they do, for i have often observed that they cause an alteration in me
and [[work]] upon my spirits according to their several virtues [[virtue]]; which makes
me approve of what is said, that the use of incense and perfumes in
churches, so ancient and so universally received in all nations and
religions, was intended to cheer us, and to rouse and purify the senses,
the [[better]] to fit us for contemplation.

i could have been glad, the [[better]] to [[judge]] of it, to have tasted the
culinary art [[arts]] of those cooks who had so rare a way of seasoning exotic
odours with the relish of meats; as it was particularly observed in the
service of the [[king]] of tunis, who in our days--[muley-hassam, in 1543.]
--landed at naples to have an interview with charles the [[emperor]].  his
dishes were larded with odoriferous drugs, to that [[degree]] of expense that
the cookery of one peacock and two pheasants amounted to a hundred ducats
to dress them after their [[fashion]]; and when the carver came to cut them
up, not only the dining-room, but all the apartments of his palace and
the adjoining streets were filled with an aromatic vapour which did not
presently vanish.

my chiefest [[care]] in choosing my lodgings is always to avoid a thick and
stinking air; and those beautiful cities [[city]], venice and [[paris]], very much
lessen the [[kindness]] i have for them, the one by the offensive smell of
her marshes, and the other of her dirt.




chapter lvi

of prayers

i propose formless and undetermined fancies, like those who publish
doubtful questions [[question]], to be after a disputed upon in the schools, not to
establish [[truth]] but to seek it; and i submit them to the judgments [[judgment]] of
those whose office it is to regulate, not my writings and actions only,
but moreover my very thoughts [[thought]].  let what i here set down meet with
correction or applause, it shall be of [[equal]] welcome and utility to me,
myself beforehand condemning as absurd and impious, if anything shall be
found, through ignorance or inadvertency, couched in this rhapsody,
contrary to the holy resolutions and prescriptions of the catholic
apostolic and roman [[church]], into which i was born and in which i will
die.  and yet, always submitting to the [[authority]] of their censure, which
has an absolute [[power]] over me, i thus rashly venture at everything, as in
treating upon this [[present]] [[subject]].

i [[know]] not if or no i am [[wrong]], but since, by a particular favour of the
divine bounty, a [[certain]] form of prayer has been prescribed and dictated
to us, word by word, from the mouth of [[god]] himself, i have ever been of
opinion that we ought to have it in more frequent use than we yet have;
and if i were worthy to advise, at the sitting down to and rising from
our tables, at our rising from and going to bed, and in every particular
action wherein prayer is used, i would that christians [[christian]] always make use of
the lord’s prayer, if not alone, yet at least always.  the [[church]] may
lengthen and diversify prayers, according to the necessity of our
instruction, for i [[know]] very well that it is always the same in substance
and the same thing: but yet such a [[privilege]] ought to be given to that
prayer, that the [[people]] should have it continually in their mouths; for
it is most [[certain]] that all necessary petitions are comprehended in it,
and that it is infinitely proper for all occasions [[occasion]].  ‘tis the only prayer
i use in all places and conditions, and which i still repeat instead of
changing; whence it also happens that i have no other so entirely by
heart as that.

it just now came into my [[mind]], whence it is we should derive that error
of having recourse to [[god]] in all our designs and enterprises, to call him
to our assistance in all sorts of affairs, and in all places where our
weakness stands in need of support, without considering whether the
occasion be just or otherwise; and to invoke his name and [[power]], in what
state soever we are, or action we are engaged in, howsoever vicious.  he
is indeed, our sole and unique protector, and can do all things for us:
but though he is pleased to [[honour]] us with this sweet paternal [[alliance]],
he is, notwithstanding, as just as he is [[good]] and mighty; and more often
exercises his [[justice]] than his [[power]], and favours us according to that,
and not according to our petitions.

plato in his laws [[law]], makes three sorts of [[belief]] injurious to the gods;
“that there are none; that they concern not themselves about our affairs;
that they never refuse anything to our vows, offerings, and sacrifices [[sacrifice]].”
 the first of these errors (according to his [[opinion]], never continued
rooted in any [[man]] from his infancy to his old age); the other two, he
confesses, [[men]] might be obstinate in.

god’s [[justice]] and his [[power]] are inseparable; ‘tis in [[vain]] we invoke his
power in an [[unjust]] cause.  we are to have our souls [[soul]] pure and clean, at
that moment at least wherein we [[pray]] to him, and purified from all
vicious [[passions]]; otherwise we ourselves [[present]] him the rods wherewith
to chastise us; instead of repairing anything we have done amiss, we
double the wickedness and the offence when we offer to him, to whom we
are to sue for pardon, an affection full of irreverence and [[hatred]].
which makes me not very apt to applaud those whom i observe to be so
frequent on their knees, if the actions nearest to the prayer do not give
me some evidence of amendment and reformation:

              “si, nocturnus adulter,
               tempora santonico velas adoperta cucullo.”

     [“if a night adulterer, thou coverest thy head with a santonic
     cowl.”--juvenal, sat., viii.  144.--the santones were the people
     who inhabited saintonge in [[france]], from whom the romans derived the
     use of hoods or cowls covering the head and face.]

and the practice of a [[man]] who mixes devotion with an execrable [[life]] seems
in some sort more to be condemned than that of a [[man]] conformable to his
own propension and dissolute throughout; and for that [[reason]] it is that
our [[church]] denies admittance to and communion with [[men]] obstinate and
incorrigible in any notorious wickedness.  we [[pray]] only by custom and for
fashion’s sake; or rather, we [[read]] or pronounce our prayers aloud, which
is no [[better]] than an hypocritical show of devotion; and i am scandalised
to see a [[man]] cross himself thrice at the benedicite, and as often at
grace (and the more, because it is a sign i have in [[great]] veneration and
continual use, even when i yawn), and to dedicate all the other hours of
the day to acts of malice, avarice, and [[injustice]].  one hour to [[god]], the
rest to the [[devil]], as if by composition and compensation.  ‘tis a wonder
to see actions so various in themselves succeed one another with such an
uniformity of method as not to interfere nor suffer any alteration, even
upon the very confines and passes from the one to the other.  what a
prodigious [[conscience]] must that be that can be at quiet within itself
whilst it harbours under the same roof, with so agreeing and so calm a
society, both the crime and the [[judge]]?

a [[man]] whose whole meditation is continually working upon nothing but
impurity which he knows [[know]] to be so odious to almighty [[god]], what can he say
when he comes to speak to him?  he draws back, but immediately falls into
a relapse.  if the object of [[divine]] [[justice]] and the presence of his maker
did, as he pretends, strike and chastise his [[soul]], how short soever the
repentance might be, the very [[fear]] of offending the infinite majesty
would so often [[present]] itself to his [[imagination]] that he would soon see
himself master of those vices [[vice]] that are most [[natural]] and vehement in him.
but what shall we say of those who settle their whole course of [[life]] upon
the [[profit]] and emolument of sins [[sin]], which they [[know]] to be mortal?  how many
trades and vocations have we admitted and countenanced amongst us, whose
very essence is vicious?  and he that, confessing himself to me,
voluntarily told me that he had all his lifetime professed and practised
a [[religion]], in his [[opinion]] damnable and contrary to that he had in his
heart, only to preserve his credit and the [[honour]] of his employments, how
could his [[courage]] suffer so infamous a [[confession]]?  what can [[men]] say to
the [[divine]] [[justice]] upon this [[subject]]?

their repentance consisting in a visible and manifest reparation, they
lose the colour of alleging it both to [[god]] and [[man]].  are they so impudent
as to sue for remission without satisfaction and without penitence?
i look upon these as in the same condition with the first: but the
obstinacy is not there so easy to be overcome.  this contrariety and
volubility of [[opinion]] so sudden, so [[violent]], that they feign, are a kind
of miracle to me: they [[present]] us with the [[state]] of an indigestible agony
of [[mind]].

it seemed to me a fantastic [[imagination]] in those who, these late years
past, were wont to reproach every [[man]] they knew to be of any
extraordinary parts, and made profession of the catholic [[religion]], that
it was but outwardly; maintaining, moreover, to do him [[honour]] forsooth,
that whatever he might pretend to the contrary he could not but in his
heart be of their reformed [[opinion]].  an untoward disease, that a man
should be so riveted to his own [[belief]] as to fancy that others cannot
believe otherwise than as he does; and yet worse, that they should
entertain so vicious an [[opinion]] of such [[great]] parts as to [[think]] any man
so qualified, should prefer any [[present]] advantage of [[fortune]] to the
promises of eternal [[life]] and the menaces of eternal damnation.  they may
believe me: could anything have tempted my [[youth]], the [[ambition]] of the
danger and difficulties in the late commotions had not been the least
motives.

it is not without very [[good]] [[reason]], in my [[opinion]], that the church
interdicts the promiscuous, indiscreet, and irreverent use of the holy
and [[divine]] psalms, with which the holy ghost inspired [[king]] [[david]].  we
ought not to mix [[god]] in our actions, but with the highest reverence and
caution; that poesy is too holy to be put to no other use than to
exercise the lungs and to delight our ears; it ought to come from the
conscience, and not from the tongue.  it is not fit that a prentice in
his shop, amongst his [[vain]] and frivolous thoughts [[thought]], should be permitted to
pass away his [[time]] and divert himself with such [[sacred]] things.  neither
is it decent to see the holy [[book]] of the holy mysteries of our belief
tumbled up and down a hall or a kitchen they were formerly mysteries, but
are now become sports [[sport]] and recreations.  ‘tis a [[book]] too serious and too
venerable to be cursorily or slightly turned over: the reading of the
scripture ought to be a temperate and premeditated act, and to which men
should always add this devout preface, ‘sursum corda’, preparing even the
body to so humble and composed a gesture and countenance as shall
evidence a particular veneration and attention.  neither is it a [[book]] for
everyone to fist, but the study of select [[men]] set apart for that [[purpose]],
and whom almighty [[god]] has been pleased to call to that office and sacred
function: the wicked and ignorant grow worse by it.  ‘tis, not a story to
tell, but a [[history]] to revere, [[fear]], and adore.  are not they then
pleasant [[men]] who [[think]] they have rendered this fit for the people’s
handling by translating it into the vulgar tongue?  does the
understanding of all therein contained only stick at words?  shall i
venture to say further, that by coming so near to [[understand]] a little,
they are much wider of the whole scope than before.  a pure and simple
ignorance and wholly depending upon the exposition of qualified persons [[person]],
was far more learned and salutary than this [[vain]] and verbal [[knowledge]],
which has only temerity and presumption.

and i do further [[believe]] that the [[liberty]] every one has taken to disperse
the [[sacred]] writ into so many idioms carries with it a [[great]] deal more of
danger than utility.  the [[jews]], mohammedans, and almost all other
peoples, have reverentially espoused the [[language]] wherein their mysteries
were first conceived, and have expressly, and not without colour of
reason, forbidden the alteration of them into any other.  are we assured
that in biscay and in brittany there are enough competent judges [[judge]] of this
affair to establish this translation into their own [[language]]?  the
universal [[church]] has not a more difficult and solemn [[judgment]] to make.
in preaching and speaking the interpretation is vague, [[free]], mutable, and
of a piece by itself; so ‘tis not the same thing.

one of our [[greek]] historians [[age]] justly censures the he lived in, because
the secrets of the [[christian]] [[religion]] were dispersed into the hands of
every mechanic, to expound and argue upon, according to his own fancy,
and that we ought to be much ashamed, we who by [[god’s]] especial favour
enjoy the pure mysteries of piety, to suffer them to be profaned by the
ignorant rabble; considering that the gentiles expressly forbad [[socrates]],
plato, and the other sages to inquire into or so much as mention the
things committed to the priests [[priest]] of delphi; and he says, moreover, that
the factions of princes [[prince]] upon theological subjects [[subject]] are armed not with zeal
but fury; that zeal springs from the [[divine]] [[wisdom]] and [[justice]], and
governs itself with prudence and moderation, but degenerates into hatred
and envy, producing tares and nettles instead of corn and wine when
conducted by [[human]] [[passions]].  and it was truly said by another, who,
advising the [[emperor]] theodosius, told him that disputes did not so much
rock the schisms of the [[church]] asleep, as it roused and animated
heresies; that, therefore, all contentions and dialectic disputations
were to be avoided, and [[men]] absolutely to acquiesce in the prescriptions
and formulas of [[faith]] established by the ancients.  and the emperor
andronicus having overheard some [[great]] [[men]] at high words in his palace
with lapodius about a point of ours of [[great]] importance, gave them so
severe a check as to threaten to cause them to be thrown into the river
if they did not desist.  the very [[women]] and [[children]] nowadays take upon
them to lecture the oldest and most experienced [[men]] about the
ecclesiastical laws [[law]]; whereas the first of those of [[plato]] forbids them to
inquire so much as into the civil laws [[law]], which were to stand instead of
divine ordinances; and, allowing the old [[men]] to confer amongst themselves
or with the magistrate about those things, he adds, provided it be not in
the presence of [[young]] or profane persons [[person]].

a bishop has left in writing that at the other end of the [[world]] there is
an isle, by the ancients called dioscorides, abundantly fertile in all
sorts of trees and fruits, and of an exceedingly healthful air; the
inhabitants of which are christians [[christian]], having churches [[church]] and altars, only
adorned with crosses without any other images, [[great]] observers of fasts
and feasts, exact payers of their tithes to the priests [[priest]], and so chaste,
that none of them is permitted to have to do with more than one woman in
his life--[what osorius says is that these [[people]] only had one [[wife]] at a
time.]--as to the rest, so content with their condition, that environed
with the sea they [[know]] nothing of navigation, and so simple that they
understand not one syllable of the [[religion]] they profess and wherein they
are so devout: a thing incredible to such as do not [[know]] that the pagans,
who are so zealous idolaters, [[know]] nothing more of their gods than their
bare names and their statues.  the ancient beginning of ‘menalippus’, a
tragedy of euripides, ran thus:

               “o jupiter!  for that name alone
               of what thou art [[arts]] to me is known.”

i have also known in my [[time]] some [[men’s]] writings found [[fault]] with for
being purely [[human]] and philosophical, without any mixture of theology;
and yet, with some show of [[reason]], it might, on the contrary, be said
that the [[divine]] doctrine, as queen and regent of the rest, [[better]] keeps
her [[state]] apart, that she ought to be [[sovereign]] throughout, not
subsidiary and suffragan, and that, peradventure, grammatical,
rhetorical, logical examples [[example]] may elsewhere be more suitably chosen, as
also the material for the stage, games, and [[public]] entertainments, than
from so [[sacred]] a matter; that [[divine]] reasons [[reason]] are considered with greater
veneration and attention by themselves, and in their own proper style,
than when mixed with and adapted to [[human]] discourse; that it is a fault
much more often observed that the divines write too humanly, than that
the humanists write not theologically enough.  [[philosophy]], says st.
chrysostom, has long been [[banished]] the holy schools, as an handmaid
altogether useless and [[thought]] unworthy to look, so much as in passing
by the door, into the sanctuary of the holy treasures of the celestial
doctrine; that the [[human]] way of speaking is of a much lower form and
ought not to adopt for herself the [[dignity]] and majesty of divine
eloquence.  let who will ‘verbis indisciplinatis’ talk of [[fortune]],
destiny, accident, [[good]] and [[evil]] hap, and other suchlike phrases,
according to his own [[humour]]; i for my part propose fancies merely human
and merely my own, and that simply as [[human]] fancies, and separately
considered, not as determined by any decree from [[heaven]], incapable of
doubt or dispute; matter of [[opinion]], not matter of [[faith]]; things which i
discourse of according to my own notions, not as i [[believe]], according to
god; after a laical, not clerical, and yet always after a very religious
manner, as [[children]] prepare their exercises, not to instruct but to be
instructed.

and might it not be said, that an edict enjoining all [[people]] but such as
are [[public]] professors of divinity, to be very reserved in writing of
religion, would carry with it a very [[good]] colour of utility and justice
--and to me, amongst the rest peradventure, to hold my prating?  i have
been told that even those who are not of our [[church]] nevertheless amongst
themselves expressly forbid the name of [[god]] to be used in common
discourse, nor so much even by way of interjection, exclamation,
assertion of a [[truth]], or comparison; and i [[think]] them in the [[right]]: upon
what [[occasion]] soever we call upon [[god]] to accompany and assist us, it
ought always to be done with the [[greatest]] reverence and devotion.

there is, as i [[remember]], a passage in xenophon where he tells us that we
ought so much the more seldom to call upon [[god]], by how much it is hard to
compose our souls [[soul]] to such a [[degree]] of calmness, patience, and devotion as
it ought to be in at such a [[time]]; otherwise our prayers are not only vain
and fruitless, but vicious: “forgive us,” we say, “our trespasses, as we
forgive them that trespass against us”; what do we mean by this petition
but that we [[present]] to [[god]] a [[soul]] [[free]] from all rancour and [[revenge]]?  and
yet we make nothing of invoking [[god’s]] assistance in our vices [[vice]], and
inviting him into our [[unjust]] designs:

          “quae, nisi seductis, nequeas committere divis”

     [“which you can only impart to the gods, when you have gained them
     over.”--persius, ii. 4.]

the covetous [[man]] prays for the conservation of his [[vain]] and superfluous
riches; the ambitious for [[victory]] and the [[good]] conduct of his [[fortune]];
the thief calls him to his assistance, to deliver him from the dangers
and difficulties that obstruct his wicked designs, or returns him thanks
for the facility he has met with in cutting a man’s throat; at the door
of the house [[men]] are going to storm or break into by [[force]] of a petard,
they fall to prayers for [[success]], their intentions and hopes [[hope]] of [[cruelty]],
avarice, and [[lust]].

         “hoc igitur, quo to jovis aurem impellere tentas,
          dic agedum staio: ‘proh jupiter!  o bone, clamet,
          jupiter!’  at sese non clamet [[jupiter]] ipse.”

     [“this therefore, with which you seek to draw the ear of [[jupiter]],
     say to staius.  ‘o jupiter!  o [[good]] jupiter!’ let him cry.  think
     you [[jupiter]] himself would not cry out upon it?”--persius, ii. 21.]

marguerite, queen of navarre,--[in the heptameron.]--tells of a young
prince, who, though she does not name him, is easily enough by his great
qualities to be known, who going upon an amorous assignation to [[lie]] with
an advocate’s [[wife]] of [[paris]], his way thither being through a [[church]], he
never passed that holy place going to or returning from his pious
exercise, but he always kneeled down to [[pray]].  wherein he would employ
the [[divine]] favour, his [[soul]] being full of such [[virtuous]] meditations,
i leave others to [[judge]], which, nevertheless, she instances for a
testimony of singular devotion.  but this is not the only proof we have
that [[women]] are not very fit to treat of theological affairs.

a true prayer and [[religious]] reconciling of ourselves to almighty god
cannot enter into an impure [[soul]], [[subject]] at the very [[time]] to the
dominion of [[satan]].  he who calls [[god]] to his assistance whilst in a course
of [[vice]], does as if a cut-purse should call a magistrate to [[help]] him, or
like those who introduce the name of [[god]] to the attestation of a [[lie]].

                         “tacito mala vota susurro
                    concipimus.”

          [“we whisper our guilty prayers.”---lucan, v. 104.]

there are few [[men]] who durst publish to the [[world]] the prayers they make to
almighty [[god]]:

         “haud cuivis promptum est, murmurque, humilesque susurros
          tollere de templis, et aperto vivere voto”

     [“‘tis not convenient for every one to bring the prayers he mutters
     out of the temple, and to give his wishes [[wish]] to the [[public]] ear.
     --“persius, ii. 6.]

and this is the [[reason]] why the pythagoreans would have them always public
and heard by every one, to the end they might not prefer indecent or
unjust petitions as this [[man]]:

              “clare quum dixit, apollo!
               labra movet, metuens audiri: pulcra laverna,
               da mihi fallere, da justum sanctumque videri;
               noctem peccatis, et fraudibus objice nubem.”

     [“when he has clearly said apollo!  he moves his lips, fearful to be
     heard; he murmurs: o [[fair]] laverna, grant me the talent to [[deceive]];
     grant me to appear holy and just; shroud my sins [[sin]] with night, and
     cast a cloud over my frauds.”--horace, ep., i.  16, 59.--(laverna
     was the [[goddess]] of thieves.)]

the gods severely punished the wicked prayers of oedipus in granting
them: he had prayed that his [[children]] might amongst themselves determine
the succession to his [[throne]] by arms, and was so miserable as to see
himself taken at his word.  we are not to [[pray]] that all things may go as
we would have them, but as most concurrent with prudence.

we seem, in [[truth]], to make use of our prayers as of a [[kind]] of jargon, and
as those do who employ holy words about sorceries and magical operations;
and as if we reckoned the benefit we are to reap from them as depending
upon the contexture, sound, and jingle of words, or upon the grave
composing of the countenance.  for having the [[soul]] contaminated with
concupiscence, not touched with repentance, or comforted by any late
reconciliation with [[god]], we go to [[present]] him such words as the memory
suggests to the tongue, and [[hope]] from thence to obtain the remission of
our sins [[sin]].  there is nothing so easy, so sweet, and so favourable, as the
divine [[law]]: it calls and invites us to her, guilty and abominable as we
are; extends her arms and receives us into her bosom, foul and polluted
as we at [[present]] are, and are for the future to be.  but then, in return,
we are to look upon her with a respectful eye; we are to receive this
pardon with all gratitude and submission, and for that instant at least,
wherein we address ourselves to her, to have the [[soul]] sensible of the
ills we have committed, and at enmity with those [[passions]] that seduced us
to offend her; neither the gods nor [[good]] [[men]] (says plato) will accept the
present of a wicked [[man]]:

                   “immunis aram si terigit manus,
                    non sumptuosa blandior hostia
                    mollivit aversos penates
                    farre pio et saliente mica.”

     [“if a pure hand has touched the altar, the pious offering of a
     small cake and a few grains of salt will appease the offended gods
     more effectually than costly sacrifices [[sacrifice]].”
      --horace, od., iii. 23, 17.]




chapter lvii

of age

i cannot allow of the way in which we settle for ourselves the duration
of our [[life]].  i see that the sages contract it very much in comparison of
the [[common]] [[opinion]]: “what,” said the younger cato to those who would stay
his hand from killing himself, “am i now of an [[age]] to be reproached that
i go out of the [[world]] too soon?”  and yet he was but eight-and-forty
years old.  he [[thought]] that to be a mature and advanced [[age]], considering
how few arrive unto it.  and such as, soothing their thoughts [[thought]] with i know
not what course of [[nature]], promise to themselves some years beyond it,
could they be privileged from the infinite number of accidents to which
we are by a [[natural]] subjection exposed, they might have some [[reason]] so to
do.  what am idle conceit is it to expect to [[die]] of a decay of [[strength]],
which is the effect of extremest [[age]], and to propose to ourselves no
shorter lease of [[life]] than that, considering it is a [[kind]] of [[death]] of all
others the most rare and very seldom seen?  we call that only a natural
death; as if it were contrary to [[nature]] to see a [[man]] break his neck with
a fall, be drowned in shipwreck, be snatched away with a pleurisy or the
plague, and as if our ordinary condition did not expose us to these
inconveniences.  let us no longer flatter ourselves with these fine
words; we ought rather, peradventure, to call that [[natural]] which is
general, [[common]], and universal.

to [[die]] of old [[age]] is a [[death]] rare, extraordinary, and singular, and,
therefore, so much less [[natural]] than the others; ‘tis the [[last]] and
extremest sort of dying: and the more remote, the less to be hoped for.
it is, indeed, the bourn beyond which we are not to pass, and which the
law of [[nature]] has set as a limit, not to be exceeded; but it is, withal,
a [[privilege]] she is rarely seen to give us to [[last]] till then.  ‘tis a
lease she only signs by particular favour, and it may be to one only in
the space of two or three ages [[age]], and then with a pass to boot, to carry
him through all the traverses and difficulties she has strewed in the way
of this long [[career]].  and therefore my [[opinion]] is, that when once forty
years we should consider it as an [[age]] to which very few arrive.  for
seeing that [[men]] do not usually proceed so far, it is a sign that we are
pretty well advanced; and since we have exceeded the ordinary bounds,
which is the just measure of [[life]], we ought not to expect to go much
further; having escaped so many precipices of [[death]], whereinto we have
seen so many other [[men]] fall, we should acknowledge that so extraordinary
a [[fortune]] as that which has hitherto rescued us from those eminent
perils, and kept us alive beyond the ordinary term of living, is not like
to continue long.

‘tis a [[fault]] in our very laws [[law]] to maintain this error: these say that a
man is not capable of managing his own estate till he be five-and-twenty
years old, whereas he will have much ado to manage his [[life]] so long.
augustus cut off five years from the ancient roman standard, and declared
that thirty years old was sufficient for a [[judge]].  servius tullius
superseded the knights of above seven-and-forty years of [[age]] from the
fatigues of [[war]]; augustus dismissed them at forty-five; though methinks
it seems a little unreasonable that [[men]] should be sent to the fireside
till five-and-fifty or sixty years of [[age]].  i should be of [[opinion]] that
our vocation and employment should be as far as possible extended for the
public [[good]]: i find the [[fault]] on the other side, that they do not employ
us early enough.  this [[emperor]] was arbiter of the whole [[world]] at
nineteen, and yet would have a [[man]] to be thirty before he could be fit to
determine a dispute about a gutter.

for my part, i [[believe]] our souls [[soul]] are adult at twenty as much as they are
ever like to be, and as capable then as ever.  a [[soul]] that has not by
that [[time]] given evident earnest of its [[force]] and [[virtue]] will never after
come to proof.  the [[natural]] qualities and virtues [[virtue]] [[produce]] what they have
of vigorous and fine, within that term or never,

                   “si l’espine rion picque quand nai,
                    a pene que picque jamai,”

               [“if the thorn does not prick at its birth,
               ‘twill hardly ever prick at all.”]

as they say in dauphin.

of all the [[great]] [[human]] actions i ever heard or [[read]] of, of what sort
soever, i have observed, both in former ages [[age]] and our own, more were
performed before the [[age]] of thirty than after; and this ofttimes in the
very lives [[life]] of the same [[men]].  may i not confidently instance in those of
hannibal and his [[great]] rival scipio?  the [[better]] half of their lives [[life]] they
lived upon the [[glory]] they had acquired in their [[youth]]; [[great]] [[men]] after,
‘tis true, in comparison of others; but by no means in comparison of
themselves.  as to my own particular, i do certainly [[believe]] that since
that [[age]], both my understanding and my [[constitution]] have rather decayed
than improved, and retired rather than advanced.  ‘tis possible, that
with those who make the [[best]] use of their [[time]], [[knowledge]] and experience
may increase with their years; but vivacity, promptitude, steadiness, and
other pieces of us, of much greater importance, and much more essentially
our own, languish and decay:

              “ubi jam validis quassatum est viribus aevi
               corpus, et obtusis ceciderunt viribus artus,
               claudicat ingenium, delirat linguaque, mensque.”

          [“when once the [[body]] is shaken by the [[violence]] of [[time]],
          [[blood]] and vigour ebbing away, the [[judgment]] halts,
          the tongue and the [[mind]] dote.”--lucretius, iii. 452.]

sometimes the [[body]] first submits to [[age]], sometimes the [[mind]]; and i have
seen enough who have got a weakness in their brains before either in
their legs or stomach; and by how much the more it is a disease of no
great [[pain]] to the sufferer, and of obscure symptoms, so much greater is
the danger.  for this [[reason]] it is that i [[complain]] of our laws [[law]], not that
they keep us too long to our [[work]], but that they set us to [[work]] too late.
for the frailty of [[life]] considered, and to how many ordinary and natural
rocks it is exposed, one ought not to give up so large a portion of it to
childhood, idleness, and apprenticeship.

     [which cotton thus renders: “birth though [[noble]], ought not to share
     so large a vacancy, and so tedious a course of [[education]].”  florio
     (1613) makes the passage [[read]] as-follows: “methinks that,
     considering the weakness of our [[life]], and seeing the infinite number
     of ordinary rocks and [[natural]] dangers it is [[subject]] unto, we should
     not, so soon as we come into the [[world]], allot so large a share
     thereof unto unprofitable wantonness in [[youth]], ill-breeding
     idleness, and slow-learning prentisage.”]

chapter i

of the inconstancy of our actions

such as make it their [[business]] to oversee [[human]] actions, do not find
themselves in anything so much perplexed as to reconcile them and bring
them into the world’s eye with the same lustre and [[reputation]]; for they
commonly so strangely contradict one another that it seems impossible
they should proceed from one and the same [[person]].  we find the younger
marius one while a [[son]] of [[mars]] and another a [[son]] of [[venus]].  [[pope]] boniface
viii. entered, it is said, into his papacy like a fox, behaved himself in
it like a lion, and died like a dog; and who could [[believe]] it to be the
same nero, the [[perfect]] image of all [[cruelty]], who, having the sentence of
a condemned [[man]] brought to him to sign, as was the custom, cried out,
“o that i had never been taught to write!” so much it went to his heart
to condemn a [[man]] to [[death]].  all story is full of such examples [[example]], and every
man is able to [[produce]] so many to himself, or out of his own practice or
observation, that i sometimes wonder to see [[men]] of understanding give
themselves the trouble of sorting these pieces, considering that
irresolution appears to me to be the most [[common]] and manifest [[vice]] of our
nature witness the famous verse of the player publius:

          “malum consilium est, quod mutari non potest.”

          [“‘tis [[evil]] counsel that will admit no [[change]].”
           --pub.  mim., ex aul. gell., xvii. 14.]

there seems some [[reason]] in forming a [[judgment]] of a [[man]] from the most
usual methods of his [[life]]; but, considering the [[natural]] instability of
our manners and opinions [[opinion]], i have often [[thought]] even the [[best]] authors a
little out in so obstinately endeavouring to make of us any constant and
solid contexture; they choose a general air of a [[man]], and according to
that interpret all his actions, of which, if they cannot bend some to a
uniformity with the rest, they are presently imputed to dissimulation.
augustus has escaped them, for there was in him so apparent, sudden, and
continual variety of actions all the whole course of his [[life]], that he
has slipped away clear and undecided from the most daring critics.  i can
more hardly [[believe]] a man’s constancy than any other [[virtue]], and believe
nothing sooner than the contrary.  he that would [[judge]] of a [[man]] in detail
and distinctly, bit by bit, would oftener be able to speak the [[truth]].  it
is a hard matter, from all antiquity, to pick out a dozen [[men]] who have
formed their lives [[life]] to one [[certain]] and constant course, which is the
principal design of [[wisdom]]; for to comprise it all in one word, says one
of the ancients, and to contract all the rules [[rule]] of [[human]] [[life]] into one,
“it is to will, and not to will, always one and the same thing: i will
not vouchsafe,” says he, “to add, provided the will be just, for if it be
not just, it is impossible it should be always one.”  i have indeed
formerly learned that [[vice]] is nothing but irregularity, and want of
measure, and therefore ‘tis impossible to fix constancy to it.  ‘tis a
saying of.  demosthenes, “that the beginning oh all [[virtue]] is
consultation and deliberation; the end and [[perfection]], constancy.”  if we
would resolve on any [[certain]] course by [[reason]], we should pitch upon the
best, but nobody has [[thought]] on’t:

          “quod petit, spernit; repetit, quod nuper omisit;
          aestuat, et vitae disconvenit ordine toto.”

     [“that which he sought he despises; what he lately lost, he seeks
     again.  he fluctuates, and is inconsistent in the whole order of
     [[life]].”--horace, ep., i. i, 98.]

our ordinary practice is to [[follow]] the inclinations of our appetite, be
it to the left or [[right]], upwards or downwards, according as we are wafted
by the breath of [[occasion]].  we never meditate what we would have till the
instant we have a [[mind]] to have it; and [[change]] like that little creature
which receives its colour from what it is laid upon.  what we but just
now proposed to ourselves we immediately alter, and presently return
again to it; ‘tis nothing but shifting and inconsistency:

               “ducimur, ut nervis alienis mobile lignum.”

     [“we are turned about like the top with the thong of others.”
      --idem, sat., ii. 7, 82.]

we do not go, we are driven; like things that float, now leisurely, then
with [[violence]], according to the gentleness or rapidity of the current:

                         “nonne videmus,
          quid sibi quisque velit, nescire, et quaerere semper
          commutare locum, quasi onus deponere possit?”

     [“do we not see them, uncertain what they want, and always asking
     for something new, as if they could get rid of the burthen.”
      --lucretius, iii. 1070.]

every day a new whimsy, and our humours [[humour]] keep motion with the [[time]].

         “tales sunt hominum mentes, quali pater ipse
          juppiter auctificas lustravit lumine terras.”

     [“such are the minds [[mind]] of [[men]], that they [[change]] as the [[light]] with
     which [[father]] [[jupiter]] himself has illumined the increasing [[earth]].”
      --cicero, frag.  poet, lib. x.]

we fluctuate betwixt various inclinations; we will nothing freely,
nothing absolutely, nothing constantly.  in any one who had prescribed
and established determinate laws [[law]] and rules [[rule]] in his head for his own
conduct, we should perceive an equality of manners, an order and an
infallible relation of one thing or action to another, shine through his
whole [[life]]; empedocles observed this discrepancy in the agrigentines,
that they gave themselves up to delights, as if every day was their [[last]],
and built as if they had been to [[live]] for ever.  the [[judgment]] would not
be hard to make, as is very evident in the younger cato; he who therein
has found one step, it will lead him to all the rest; ‘tis a harmony of
very according sounds, that cannot jar.  but with us ‘t is quite
contrary; every particular action requires a particular [[judgment]].  the
surest way to steer, in my [[opinion]], would be to take our measures from
the nearest allied circumstances, without engaging in a longer
inquisition, or without concluding any other consequence.  i was told,
during the civil disorders of our [[poor]] [[kingdom]], that a maid, hard by the
place where i then was, had thrown herself out of a window to avoid being
forced by a [[common]] soldier who was quartered in the house; she was not
killed by the fall, and therefore, repeating her attempt would have cut
her own throat, had she not been prevented; but having, nevertheless,
wounded herself to some show of danger, she voluntarily confessed that
the soldier had not as yet importuned her otherwise; than by courtship,
earnest solicitation, and presents [[present]]; but that she was afraid that in the
end he would have proceeded to [[violence]], all which she delivered with
such a countenance and accent, and withal embrued in her own [[blood]], the
highest testimony of her [[virtue]], that she appeared another lucretia; and
yet i have since been very well assured that both before and after she
was not so difficult a piece.  and, according to my host’s tale in
ariosto, be as handsome a [[man]] and as worthy a gentleman as you will, do
not conclude too much upon your mistress’s inviolable chastity for having
been repulsed; you do not [[know]] but she may have a [[better]] stomach to your
muleteer.

antigonus, having taken one of his soldiers into a [[great]] [[degree]] of favour
and esteem for his valour, gave his physicians strict charge to cure him
of a long and inward disease under which he had a [[great]] while languished,
and observing that, after his cure, he went much more coldly to [[work]] than
before, he [[asked]] him what had so altered and cowed him: “yourself, sir,”
 replied the other, “by having eased me of the pains [[pain]] that made me weary of
my [[life]].”  lucullus’s soldier having been rifled by the [[enemy]], performed
upon them in [[revenge]] a brave exploit, by which having made himself a
gainer, lucullus, who had conceived a [[good]] [[opinion]] of him from that
action, went about to engage him in some enterprise of very [[great]] danger,
with all the plausible persuasions and promises he could [[think]] of;

          “verbis, quae timido quoque possent addere mentem”

          [“words which might add [[courage]] to any timid [[man]].”
           --horace, ep., ii. 2, 1, 2.]

“pray employ,” answered he, “some miserable plundered soldier in that
affair”:

                         “quantumvis rusticus, ibit,
               ibit eo, quo vis, qui zonam perdidit, inquit;”

     [“some [[poor]] fellow, who has lost his purse, will go whither you
     [[wish]], said he.”--horace, ep., ii. 2, 39.]

and flatly refused to go.  when we [[read]] that mahomet having furiously
rated chasan, bassa of the janissaries, because he had seen the
hungarians break into his squadrons, and himself behave very ill in the
business, and that chasan, instead of any other [[answer]], rushed furiously
alone, scimitar in hand, into the first [[body]] of the [[enemy]], where he was
presently cut to pieces, we are not to look upon that action,
peradventure, so much as vindication as a turn of [[mind]], not so much
natural valour as a sudden despite.  the [[man]] you saw yesterday so
adventurous and brave, you must not [[think]] it [[strange]] to see him as great
a poltroon the next: anger, necessity, company, wine, or the sound of the
trumpet had roused his spirits; this is no valour formed and established
by [[reason]], but accidentally created by such circumstances, and therefore
it is no wonder if by contrary circumstances it appear quite another
thing.

these supple variations and contradictions so manifest in us, have given
occasion to some to [[believe]] that [[man]] has two souls [[soul]]; other two distinct
powers that always accompany and incline us, the one towards [[good]] and the
other towards ill, according to their own [[nature]] and propension; so
abrupt a variety not being imaginable to flow from one and the same
source.

for my part, the puff of every accident not only carries me along with it
according to its own proclivity, but moreover i discompose and trouble
myself by the instability of my own posture; and whoever will look
narrowly into his own bosom, will hardly find himself twice in the same
condition.  i give to my [[soul]] sometimes one face and sometimes another,
according to the side i turn her to.  if i speak variously of myself, it
is because i consider myself variously; all the contrarieties are there
to be found in one corner or another; after one [[fashion]] or another:
bashful, insolent; chaste, lustful; prating, silent; laborious, delicate;
ingenious, heavy; melancholic, pleasant; lying, true; knowing, ignorant;
liberal, covetous, and prodigal: i find all this in myself, more or less,
according as i turn myself about; and whoever will sift himself to the
bottom, will find in himself, and even in his own [[judgment]], this
volubility and discordance.  i have nothing to say of myself entirely,
simply, and solidly without mixture and confusion.  ‘distinguo’ is the
most universal member of my [[logic]].  though i always intend to speak well
of [[good]] things, and rather to interpret such things as fall out in the
best sense than otherwise, yet such is the strangeness of our condition,
that we are often pushed on to do well even by [[vice]] itself, if well-doing
were not judged by the intention only.  one gallant action, therefore,
ought not to conclude a [[man]] valiant; if a [[man]] were brave indeed, he would
be always so, and upon all occasions [[occasion]].  if it were a habit of valour and
not a sally, it would render a [[man]] equally resolute in all accidents; the
same alone as in company; the same in lists as in a [[battle]]: for, let them
say what they will, there is not one valour for the pavement and another
for the field; he would bear a sickness in his bed as bravely as a wound
in the field, and no more [[fear]] [[death]] in his own house than at an assault.
we should not then see the same [[man]] charge into a breach with a brave
assurance, and afterwards torment himself like a woman for the loss of a
trial at [[law]] or the [[death]] of a child; when, being an infamous [[coward]], he
is firm in the necessities of [[poverty]]; when he shrinks at the sight of a
barber’s razor, and rushes fearless upon the swords [[sword]] of the [[enemy]], the
action is commendable, not the [[man]].

many of the greeks [[greek]], says cicero,--[cicero, tusc. quaes., ii. 27.]--
cannot endure the sight of an [[enemy]], and yet are courageous in sickness;
the cimbrians and celtiberians quite contrary;

              “nihil enim potest esse aequabile,
               quod non a certa ratione proficiscatur.”

     [“nothing can be regular that does not proceed from a fixed ground
     of [[reason]].”--idem, ibid., c. 26.]

no valour can be more extreme in its [[kind]] than that of alexander: but it
is of but one [[kind]], nor full enough throughout, nor universal.
incomparable as it is, it has yet some blemishes; of which his being so
often at his wits’ end upon every [[light]] suspicion of his captains
conspiring against his [[life]], and the carrying himself in that inquisition
with so much vehemence and indiscreet [[injustice]], and with a [[fear]] that
subverted his [[natural]] [[reason]], is one pregnant instance.  the
superstition, also, with which he was so much tainted, carries along with
it some image of pusillanimity; and the excess of his penitence for the
murder of clytus is also a testimony of the unevenness of his [[courage]].
all we perform is no other than a cento, as a [[man]] may say, of several
pieces, and we would acquire [[honour]] by a false title.  [[virtue]] cannot be
followed but for herself, and if one sometimes borrows her mask to some
other [[purpose]], she presently pulls it away again.  ‘tis a vivid and
strong tincture which, when the [[soul]] has once thoroughly imbibed it, will
not out but with the piece.  and, therefore, to make a [[right]] [[judgment]] of
a [[man]], we are long and very observingly to [[follow]] his trace: if constancy
does not there stand firm upon her own proper base,

               “cui vivendi via considerata atque provisa est,”

     [“if the way of his [[life]] is thoroughly considered and traced out.”
      --cicero, paradox, v. 1.]

if the variety of occurrences makes him alter his pace (his path, i mean,
for the pace may be faster or slower) let him go; such an one runs before
the wind, “avau le dent,” as the motto of our talebot has it.

‘tis no wonder, says one of the ancients, that [[chance]] has so [[great]] a
dominion over us, since it is by [[chance]] we [[live]].  it is not possible for
any one who has not designed his [[life]] for some [[certain]] end, it is
impossible for any one to arrange the pieces, who has not the whole form
already contrived in his [[imagination]].  of what use are colours to him
that knows [[know]] not what he is to paint?  no one lays down a [[certain]] design
for his [[life]], and we only deliberate thereof by pieces.  the archer ought
first to [[know]] at what he is to aim, and then accommodate his arm, bow,
string, shaft, and motion to it; our counsels deviate and wander, because
not levelled to any determinate end.  no wind serves him who addresses
his [[voyage]] to no [[certain]], port.  i cannot acquiesce in the [[judgment]] given
by one in the behalf of sophocles,  who concluded him capable of the
management of domestic affairs, against the accusation of his [[son]], from
having [[read]] one of his tragedies.

neither do i allow of the conjecture of the parians, sent to regulate the
milesians sufficient for such a consequence as they from thence derived
coming to visit the island, they took notice of such grounds as were best
husbanded, and such country-houses as were [[best]] governed; and having
taken the names of the owners, when they had assembled the [[citizens]], they
appointed these farmers [[farmer]] for new governors and magistrates; concluding
that they, who had been so provident in their own private concerns, would
be so of the [[public]] too.  we are all lumps, and of so various and inform
a contexture, that every piece plays, every moment, its own game, and
there is as much difference betwixt us and ourselves as betwixt us and
others:

               “magnam rem puta, unum hominem agere.”

     [“esteem it a [[great]] thing always to act as one and the same
     [[man]].”--seneca, ep., 150.]

since [[ambition]] can [[teach]] [[man]] valour, temperance, and liberality, and even
justice too; seeing that avarice can inspire the [[courage]] of a shop-boy,
bred and nursed up in obscurity and ease, with the assurance to expose
himself so far from the fireside to the [[mercy]] of the waves and angry
neptune in a frail boat; that she further teaches [[teach]] discretion and
prudence; and that even [[venus]] can inflate boys under the discipline of
the rod with boldness and resolution, and infuse masculine [[courage]] into
the [[heart]] of tender virgins in their mothers’ arms:

         “hac duce, custodes furtim transgressa jacentes,
          ad juvenem tenebris sola puella venit:”

     [“she leading, the maiden, furtively passing by the recumbent
     guards, goes alone in the darkness to the [[youth]].”
      --tibullus, ii. 2, 75.]

‘tis not all the understanding has to do, simply to [[judge]] us by our
outward actions; it must penetrate the very [[soul]], and there discover by
what springs the motion is guided.  but that being a high and hazardous
undertaking, i could [[wish]] that fewer would attempt it.




chapter ii

of drunkenness

the [[world]] is nothing but variety and disemblance, vices [[vice]] are all alike, as
they are vices [[vice]], and peradventure the stoics [[understand]] them so; but
although they are equally vices [[vice]], yet they are not all [[equal]] vices [[vice]]; and he
who has transgressed the ordinary bounds a hundred paces:

          “quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum,”

          [“beyond or within which the [[right]] cannot [[exist]].”
           --horace, sat., i, 1, 107.]

should not be in a worse condition than he that has advanced but ten, is
not to be believed; or that sacrilege is not worse than stealing a
cabbage:

         “nec vincet ratio hoc, tantumdem ut peccet, idemque,
          qui teneros caules alieni fregerit horti,
          et qui nocturnus divum sacra legerit.”

there is in this as [[great]] [[diversity]] as in anything whatever.  the
confounding of the order and measure of sins [[sin]] is dangerous: murderers,
traitors, and tyrants [[tyrant]] get too much by it, and it is not reasonable they
should flatter their consciences, because another [[man]] is idle,
lascivious, or not assiduous at his devotion.  every one overrates the
offence of his companions, but extenuates his own.  our very instructors
themselves rank them sometimes, in my [[opinion]], very ill.  as socrates
said that the principal office of [[wisdom]] was to distinguish [[good]] from
evil, we, the [[best]] of whom are vicious, ought also to say the same of the
science of distinguishing betwixt [[vice]] and [[vice]], without which, and that
very exactly performed, the [[virtuous]] and the wicked will remain
confounded and unrecognised.

now, amongst the rest, drunkenness seems to me to be a gross and brutish
vice.  the [[soul]] has greater part in the rest, and there are some vices
that have something, if a [[man]] may so say, of generous in them; there are
vices wherein there is a mixture of [[knowledge]], diligence, valour,
prudence, dexterity, and address; this one is totally corporeal and
earthly.  and the rudest nation this day in [[europe]] is that alone where it
is in [[fashion]].  other vices [[vice]] discompose the understanding: this totally
overthrows it and renders the [[body]] stupid:

              “cum vini vis penetravit .  .  .
               consequitur gravitas membrorum, praepediuntur
               crura vacillanti, tardescit lingua, madet mens [[men]],
               nant oculi; clamor, singultus, jurgia, gliscunt.”

     [“when the [[power]] of wine has penetrated us, a heaviness of the limbs
     follows, the legs of the tottering [[person]] are impeded; the tongue
     grows torpid, the [[mind]] is dimmed, the [[eyes]] swim; noise, hiccup, and
     quarrels arise.--“lucretius, i. 3, 475.]

the worst [[state]] of [[man]] is that wherein he loses the [[knowledge]] and
government of himself.  and ‘tis said amongst other things upon this
subject, that, as the must fermenting in a vessel, works [[work]] up to the top
whatever it has in the bottom, so wine, in those who have drunk beyond
measure, vents the most inward secrets:

                   “tu sapientum
                    curas et arcanum jocoso
                    consilium retegis lyaeo.”

     [“thou disclosest to the merry lyacus the cares [[care]] and secret
     counsel of the [[wise]].”--horace, od., xxi. 1, 114.]

     [lyacus, a name given to bacchus.]

josephus tells us that by giving an ambassador the [[enemy]] had sent to him
his full dose of liquor, he wormed out his secrets.  and yet, augustus,
committing the most inward secrets of his affairs to lucius piso, who
conquered thrace, never found him faulty in the least, no more than
tiberias did cossus, with whom he intrusted his whole counsels, though we
know they were both so given to drink that they have often been fain to
carry both the one and the other drunk out of the senate:

          “hesterno inflatum venas ut semper, lyaeo.”

     [“their veins full, as usual, of yesterday’s wine.”
      --virgil, egl., vi.  15.]

and the design of killing caesar was as safely communicated to cimber,
though he would often be drunk, as to cassius, who drank nothing but
water.

     [as to which cassius pleasantly said: “what, shall i bear
     a [[tyrant]], i who cannot bear wine?”]

we see our germans, when drunk as the [[devil]], [[know]] their post, remember
the word, and keep to their ranks:

               “nec facilis victoria de madidis, et
               blaesis, atque mero titubantibus.”

     [“nor is a [[victory]] easily obtained over [[men]] so drunk, they can
     scarce speak or stand.”--juvenal, sat., xv.  47.]

i could not have believed there had been so profound, senseless, and dead
a [[degree]] of drunkenness had i not [[read]] in [[history]] that attalus having,
to put a notable affront upon him, invited to supper the same pausanias,
who upon the very same [[occasion]] afterwards killed philip of macedon,
a [[king]] who by his excellent qualities gave sufficient testimony of his
education in the house and company of epaminondas, made him drink to such
a pitch that he could after abandon his [[beauty]], as of a hedge strumpet,
to the muleteers and servants of the basest office in the house.  and i
have been further told by a [[lady]] whom i highly [[honour]] and esteem, that
near bordeaux and about castres  where she lives [[life]], a [[country]] woman, a
widow of chaste repute, perceiving in herself the first symptoms of
breeding, innocently told her neighbours that if she had a husband she
should [[think]] herself with child; but the causes of suspicion every day
more and more increasing, and at [[last]] growing up to a manifest proof, the
poor woman was reduced to the necessity of causing it to be proclaimed in
her parish [[church]], that whoever had done that deed and would frankly
confess it, she did not only promise to [[forgive]], but moreover to marry
him, if he liked the motion; whereupon a [[young]] fellow that served her in
the quality of a labourer, encouraged by this proclamation, declared that
he had one holiday found her, having taken too much of the bottle, so
fast asleep by the chimney and in so indecent a posture, that he could
conveniently do his [[business]] without waking her; and they yet live
together [[man]] and [[wife]].

it is true that antiquity has not much decried this [[vice]]; the writings
even of several [[philosophers]] speak very tenderly of it, and even amongst
the stoics there are some who advise folks to give themselves sometimes
the [[liberty]] to drink, nay, to drunkenness, to refresh the [[soul]]:

          “hoc quoque virtutum quondam certamine, magnum
          socratem palmam promeruisse ferunt.”

     [“in this [[trial]] of [[power]] formerly they relate that the great
     [[socrates]] deserved the palm.”--cornet. gallus, ep., i. 47.]

that censor and reprover of others, cato, was reproached that he was a
hard drinker:

                    “narratur et prisci catonis
                    saepe mero caluisse virtus.”

     [“and of old cato it is said, that his [[courage]] was often warmed with
     wine.”--horace, od., xxi. 3, 11.--cato the elder.]

cyrus, that so renowned [[king]], amongst the other qualities by which he
claimed to be preferred before his [[brother]] artaxerxes, urged this
excellence, that he could drink a [[great]] deal more than he.  and in the
best governed nations this [[trial]] of [[skill]] in drinking is very much in
use.  i have heard silvius, an excellent physician of [[paris]], say that
lest the digestive faculties of the stomach should grow idle, it were not
amiss once a month to rouse them by this excess, and to spur them lest
they should grow dull and rusty; and one author tells us that the
persians used to consult about their most important affairs after being
well warmed with wine.

my taste and [[constitution]] are greater enemies [[enemy]] to this [[vice]] than my
discourse; for besides that i easily submit my [[belief]] to the [[authority]] of
ancient opinions [[opinion]], i look upon it indeed as an unmanly and stupid [[vice]],
but less malicious and hurtful than the others, which, almost all, more
directly jostle [[public]] [[society]].  and if we cannot please ourselves but it
must cost us something, as they hold, i find this [[vice]] costs a man’s
conscience less than the others, besides that it is of no difficult
preparation, nor hard to be found, a consideration not altogether to be
despised.  a [[man]] well advanced both in [[dignity]] and [[age]], amongst three
principal commodities that he said remained to him of [[life]], reckoned to
me this for one, and where would a [[man]] more justly find it than amongst
the [[natural]] conveniences?  but he did not take it [[right]], for delicacy and
the [[curious]] [[choice]] of wines is therein to be avoided.  if you found your
pleasure upon drinking of the [[best]], you condemn yourself to the penance
of drinking of the worst.  your taste must be more indifferent and [[free]];
so delicate a palate is not required to make a [[good]] toper.  the germans
drink almost indifferently of all wines with delight; their [[business]] is
to pour down and not to taste; and it’s so much the [[better]] for them:
their [[pleasure]] is so much the more plentiful and nearer at hand.

secondly, to drink, after the french [[fashion]], but at two meals, and then
very moderately, is to be too sparing of the favours of the [[god]].  there
is more [[time]] and constancy required than so.  the ancients spent whole
nights in this exercise, and ofttimes added the day following to eke it
out, and therefore we are to take greater [[liberty]] and stick closer to our
work.  i have seen a [[great]] [[lord]] of my [[time]], a [[man]] of high enterprise and
famous [[success]], that without setting himself to’t, and after his ordinary
rate of drinking at meals, drank not much less than five quarts of wine,
and at his going away appeared but too [[wise]] and discreet, to the
detriment of our affairs.  the [[pleasure]] we hold in esteem for the course
of our lives [[life]] ought to have a greater share of our [[time]] dedicated to it;
we should, like shopboys and labourers, refuse no [[occasion]] nor omit any
opportunity of drinking, and always have it in our minds [[mind]].  methinks we
every day abridge and curtail the use of wine, and that the after
breakfasts, dinner snatches, and collations i used to see in my father’s
house, when i was a boy, were more usual and frequent then than now.

is it that we pretend to a reformation?  truly, no: but it may be we are
more addicted to [[venus]] than our fathers [[father]] were.  they are two exercises
that thwart and hinder one another in their vigour.  lechery weakens our
stomach on the one side; and on the other sobriety renders us more spruce
and amorous for the exercise of [[love]].

‘tis wonderful what [[strange]] stories i have heard my [[father]] tell of the
chastity of that [[age]] wherein he lived.  it was for him to say it, being
both by art [[arts]] and [[nature]] cut out and finished for the service of ladies [[lady]].
he spoke well and little: ever mixing his [[language]] with some illustration
out of authors most in use, especially in spanish, and among the spanish
he whom they called marcus aurelius--[ guevara’s golden [[book]] of marcus
aurelius antoninus.]--was ordinarily in his mouth.  his behaviour was
gently grave, humble, and very modest; he was very solicitous of neatness
and propriety both in his [[person]] and clothes, whether on horseback or
afoot, he was monstrously punctual in his word; and of a [[conscience]] and
religion generally tending rather towards superstition than otherwise.
for a [[man]] of little stature, very [[strong]], well proportioned, and well
knit; of a pleasing countenance inclining to brown, and very adroit in
all [[noble]] exercises.  i have yet in the house to be seen canes poured
full of lead, with which they say he exercised his arms for throwing the
bar or the stone, or in fencing; and shoes with leaden soles to make him
lighter for running or leaping.  of his vaulting he has left little
miracles behind him: i have seen him when [[past]] three score laugh at our
exercises, and throw himself in his furred gown into the saddle, make the
tour of a table upon his thumbs and scarce ever mount the stairs into his
chamber without taking three or four steps at a [[time]].  but as to what i
was speaking of before; he said there was scarce one woman of quality of
ill fame in the whole province: he would tell of [[strange]] confidences, and
some of them his own, with [[virtuous]] [[women]], [[free]] from any manner of
suspicion of ill, and for his own part solemnly swore he was a virgin at
his [[marriage]]; and yet it was after a long practice of arms beyond the
mountains, of which wars [[war]] he left us a journal under his own hand, wherein
he has given a precise account from point to point of all passages, both
relating to the [[public]] and to himself.  and he was, moreover, [[married]] at
a well advanced maturity, in the year 1528, the three-and-thirtieth year
of his [[age]], upon his way [[home]] from [[italy]].  but let us return to our
bottles.

the incommodities of old [[age]], that stand in need of some refreshment and
support, might with [[reason]] beget in me a [[desire]] of this faculty, it being
as it were the [[last]] [[pleasure]] the course of years deprives us of.  the
natural heat, say the good-fellows, first seats itself in the feet: that
concerns infancy; thence it mounts into the middle region, where it makes
a long abode and produces [[produce]], in my [[opinion]], the sole true pleasures [[pleasure]] of
human [[life]]; all other pleasures [[pleasure]] in comparison sleep; towards the end,
like a vapour that still mounts upward, it arrives at the throat, where
it makes its final residence, and concludes the [[progress]].  i do not,
nevertheless, [[understand]] how a [[man]] can extend the [[pleasure]] of drinking
beyond thirst, and forge in his [[imagination]] an appetite artificial and
against [[nature]]; my stomach would not proceed so far; it has enough to do
to deal with what it takes in for its necessity.  my [[constitution]] is not
to [[care]] for drink but as following eating and washing down my meat, and
for that [[reason]] my [[last]] draught is always the [[greatest]].  and seeing that
in old [[age]] we have our palate furred with phlegms or depraved by some
other ill [[constitution]], the wine tastes [[better]] to us as the pores are
cleaner washed and laid more open.  at least, i seldom taste the first
glass well.  anacharsis wondered that the greeks [[greek]] drank in greater glasses
towards the end of a meal than at the beginning; which was, i suppose,
for the same [[reason]] the germans do the same, who then begin the [[battle]] of
drink.

plato forbids [[children]] wine till eighteen years of [[age]], and to get drunk
till forty; but, after forty, gives them leave to please themselves, and
to mix a little liberally in their feasts the influence of dionysos, that
good deity who restores to younger [[men]] their gaiety and to old [[men]] their
youth; who mollifies the [[passions]] of the [[soul]], as iron is softened by
fire; and in his lazes allows such merry meetings, provided they have a
discreet [[chief]] to govern and keep them in order, as [[good]] and of great
utility; drunkenness being, he says, a true and [[certain]] [[trial]] of every
one’s [[nature]], and, withal, fit to inspire old [[men]] with mettle to divert
themselves in dancing and [[music]]; things of [[great]] use, and that they dare
not attempt when sober.  he, moreover, says that wine is able to supply
the [[soul]] with temperance and the [[body]] with health.  nevertheless, these
restrictions, in part borrowed from the carthaginians, please him: that
men forbear excesses in the expeditions of [[war]]; that every [[judge]] and
magistrate abstain from it when about the administrations of his place or
the consultations of the [[public]] affairs; that the day is not to be
employed with it, that being a [[time]] due to other occupations, nor the
night on which a [[man]] intends to get [[children]].

‘tis said that the philosopher stilpo, when [[oppressed]] with [[age]], purposely
hastened his end by drinking pure wine.  the same thing, but not designed
by him, despatched also the philosopher arcesilaus.

but ‘tis an old and pleasant [[question]], whether the [[soul]] of a [[wise]] [[man]] can
be overcome by the [[strength]] of wine?

               “si munitae adhibet vim sapientiae.”

to what vanity does the [[good]] [[opinion]] we have of ourselves push us?  the
most regular and most [[perfect]] [[soul]] in the [[world]] has but too much to do to
keep itself upright, and from being overthrown by its own weakness.
there is not one of a thousand that is [[right]] and settled so much as one
minute in a whole [[life]], and that may not very well [[doubt]], whether
according to her [[natural]] condition she ever can be; but to join constancy
to it is her utmost [[perfection]]; i mean when nothing should jostle and
discompose her, which a thousand accidents may do.  ‘tis to much purpose
that the [[great]] poet lucretius keeps such a clatter with his [[philosophy]],
when, behold!  he goes mad with a [[love]] philtre.  is it to be imagined
that an apoplexy will not stun [[socrates]] as well as a porter?  some men
have forgotten their own names by the [[violence]] of a disease; and a slight
wound has turned the [[judgment]] of others topsy-turvy.  let him be as wise
as he will, after all he is but a [[man]]; and than that what is there more
frail, more miserable, or more nothing?  [[wisdom]] does not [[force]] our
natural dispositions,

               “sudores itaque, et pallorem exsistere toto
               corpore, et infringi linguam, vocemque aboriri,
               caligare oculos, sonere aures, succidere artus,
               demque concidere, ex animi terrore, videmus.”

     [“sweat and paleness come over the whole [[body]], the tongue is
     rendered powerless, the voice dies away, the [[eyes]] are darkened,
     there is ringing in the ears, the limbs sink under us by the
     influence of [[fear]].”--lucretius, iii. 155.]

he must shut his [[eyes]] against the blow that threatens him; he must
tremble upon the margin of a precipice, like a child; [[nature]] having
reserved these [[light]] marks of her [[authority]], not to be forced by our
reason and the stoic [[virtue]], to [[teach]] [[man]] his [[mortality]] and our weakness;
he turns pale with [[fear]], red with shame, and groans with the cholic, if
not with desperate outcry, at least with hoarse and broken voice:

               “humani a se nihil alienum putet.”

     [“let him not [[think]] himself exempt from that which is incidental to
     [[men]] in general.”--terence, heauton, i. 1, 25.]

the poets, that feign all things at [[pleasure]], dare not acquit their
greatest heroes of tears:

          “sic fatur lacrymans, classique immittit habenas.”

     [“thus he speaks, weeping, and then sets sail with his fleet.”
      --aeneid, vi. i.]

‘tis sufficient for a [[man]] to curb and moderate his inclinations, for
totally to suppress them is not in him to do.  even our [[great]] plutarch,
that excellent and [[perfect]] [[judge]] of [[human]] actions, when he sees brutus
and torquatus kill their [[children]], begins to [[doubt]] whether [[virtue]] could
proceed so far, and to [[question]] whether these persons [[person]] had not rather been
stimulated by some other passion.--[plutarch, [[life]] of publicola, c.  3.]
--all actions exceeding the ordinary bounds are liable to sinister
interpretation, for as much as our liking no more holds with what is
above than with what is below it.

let us leave that other sect, that sets up an express profession of
scornful superiority--[the stoics.]--: but when even in that sect,
reputed the most quiet and gentle, we hear these rhodomontades of
metrodorus:

          “occupavi te, fortuna, atque cepi: omnesque aditus tuos
          interclusi ut ad me aspirare non posses;”

     [“fortune, i have got the [[better]] of thee, and have made all the
     avenues so sure thou canst not come at me.”
      --cicero, tusc. quaes., v. 9.]

when anaxarchus, by command of nicocreon the [[tyrant]] of cyprus, was put
into a stone mortar, and laid upon with mauls of iron, ceases not to say,
“strike, batter, break; ‘tis not anaxarchus, ‘tis but his sheath that you
pound and bray so”; when we hear our martyrs cry out to the [[tyrant]] from
the middle of the flame, “this side is roasted enough, fall to and [[eat]],
it is enough done; fall to [[work]] with the other;” when we hear the child
in josephus’ torn piece-meal with pincers, defying antiochus, and crying
out with a constant and assured voice: “tyrant, thou losest thy [[labour]],
i am still at ease; where is the [[pain]], where are the torments with which
thou didst so threaten me?  is this all thou canst do?  my constancy
torments thee more than thy [[cruelty]] does me.  o pitiful [[coward]], thou
faintest, and i grow stronger; make me [[complain]], make me bend, make me
yield if thou canst; encourage thy guards, cheer up thy executioners;
see, see they faint, and can do no more; arm them, flesh them anew, spur
them up”; truly, a [[man]] must confess that there is some phrenzy, some
fury, how holy soever, that at that [[time]] possesses those souls [[soul]].  when we
come to these stoical sallies: “i had rather be mad than voluptuous,” a
saying of antisthenes.  when sextius tells us, “he had rather be fettered
with affliction than pleasure”: when epicurus takes upon him to play with
his gout, and, refusing health and ease, defies all torments, and
despising the lesser pains [[pain]], as disdaining to contend with them, he covets
and calls out for others sharper, more [[violent]], and more worthy of him;

          “spumantemque dari, pecora inter inertia, votis
          optat aprum, aut fulvum descendere monte leonem:”

     [“and instead of timid beasts, wishes [[wish]] the foaming boar or tawny lion
     would come from the mountain.”--aeneid, iv. 158.]

who but must conclude that these are wild sallies pushed on by a courage
that has broken loose from its place?  our [[soul]] cannot from her own seat
reach so high; ‘tis necessary she must leave it, raise herself up, and,
taking the bridle in her teeth, transport her [[man]] so far that he shall
afterwards himself be astonished at what he has done; as, in [[war]], the
heat of [[battle]] impels generous soldiers to perform things of so infinite
danger, as afterwards, recollecting them, they themselves are the first
to wonder at; as it also fares with the poets, who are often rapt with
admiration of their own writings, and [[know]] not where again to find the
track through which they performed so fine a [[career]]; which also is in
them called fury and rapture.  and as [[plato]] says, ‘tis to no [[purpose]] for
a sober-minded [[man]] to knock at the door of poesy: so [[aristotle]] says, that
no excellent [[soul]] is exempt from a mixture of madness; and he has reason
to call all transports, how commendable soever, that surpass our own
judgment and understanding, madness; forasmuch as [[wisdom]] is a regular
government of the [[soul]], which is carried on with measure and proportion,
and for which she is to herself responsible.  [[plato]] argues thus, that the
faculty of prophesying is so far above us, that we must be out of
ourselves when we meddle with it, and our prudence must either be
obstructed by sleep or sickness, or lifted from her place by some
celestial rapture.




chapter iii

a custom of the isle of cea

          [cos.  cea is the form of the name given by pliny]

if to philosophise be, as ‘tis defined, to [[doubt]], much more to write at
random and play the [[fool]], as i do, ought to be reputed doubting, for it
is for novices and freshmen to inquire and to dispute, and for the
chairman to moderate and determine.

my moderator is the [[authority]] of the [[divine]] will, that governs us without
contradiction, and that is seated above these [[human]] and vain
contestations.

philip having forcibly entered into peloponnesus, and some one saying to
damidas that the lacedaemonians were likely very much to suffer if they
did not in [[time]] reconcile themselves to his favour:  “why, you pitiful
fellow,” replied he, “what can they suffer who do not [[fear]] to [[die]]?”  it
being also [[asked]] of agis, which way a [[man]] might [[live]] [[free]]?  “why,” said
he, “by despising [[death]].”  these, and a thousand other sayings to the
same [[purpose]], distinctly sound of something more than the patient
attending the stroke of [[death]] when it shall come; for there are several
accidents in [[life]] far worse to suffer than [[death]] itself.  witness the
lacedaemonian boy taken by antigonus, and sold for a [[slave]], who being by
his master commanded to some base employment: “thou shalt see,” says the
boy, “whom thou hast bought; it would be a shame for me to serve, being
so near the reach of [[liberty]],” and having so said, threw himself from the
top of the house.  antipater severely threatening the lacedaemonians,
that he might the [[better]] incline them to acquiesce in a [[certain]] demand of
his: “if thou threatenest us with more than [[death]],” replied they, “we
shall the more willingly die”; and to philip, having written them word
that he would frustrate all their enterprises: “what, wilt thou also
hinder us from dying?”  this is the meaning of the sentence, “that the
wise [[man]] lives [[life]] as long as he ought, not so long as he can; and that the
most obliging [[present]] [[nature]] has made us, and which takes from us all
colour of complaint of our condition, is to have delivered into our own
custody the keys of [[life]]; she has only ordered, one door into [[life]], but a
hundred thousand ways out.  we may be straitened for [[earth]] to [[live]] upon,
but [[earth]] sufficient to [[die]] upon can never be wanting, as boiocalus
answered the romans.”--[tacitus, annal., xiii.  56.]--why dost thou
complain of this [[world]]?  it detains thee not; thy own cowardice is the
cause, if thou livest in [[pain]].  there needs no more to [[die]] but to will to
die:

               “ubique mors est; optime hoc cavit deus.
               eripere vitam nemo non homini potest;
               at nemo mortem; mille ad hanc aditus patent.”

     [“death is everywhere: [[heaven]] has well provided for that.  any one
     may deprive us of [[life]]; no one can deprive us of [[death]].  to death
     there are a thousand avenues.”--seneca, theb:, i, i, 151.]

neither is it a recipe for one disease only; [[death]] is the infallible cure
of all; ‘tis a most assured port that is never to be feared, and very
often to be sought.  it comes all to one, whether a [[man]] give himself his
end, or stays to receive it by some other means; whether he pays [[pay]] before
his day, or stay till his day of payment come; from whencesoever it
comes, it is still his; in what part soever the thread breaks, there’s
the end of the clue.  the most voluntary [[death]] is the finest.  life
depends upon the [[pleasure]] of others; [[death]] upon our own.  we ought not to
accommodate ourselves to our own [[humour]] in anything so much as in this.
reputation is not concerned in such an enterprise; ‘tis folly to be
concerned by any such apprehension. living is [[slavery]] if the [[liberty]] of
dying be wanting.  the ordinary method of cure is carried on at the
expense of [[life]]; they torment us with caustics, incisions, and
amputations of limbs; they interdict aliment and exhaust our [[blood]]; one
step farther and we are cured indeed and effectually.  why is not the
jugular vein as much at our disposal as the median vein?  for a desperate
disease a desperate cure.  servius the grammarian, being tormented with
the gout, could [[think]] of no [[better]] remedy than to apply poison to his
legs, to deprive them of their sense; let them be gouty at their will, so
they were insensible of [[pain]].  [[god]] gives us leave enough to go when he is
pleased to reduce us to such a condition that to [[live]] is far worse than
to [[die]].  ‘tis weakness to truckle under infirmities, but it’s madness to
nourish them.  the stoics say, that it is living according to [[nature]] in a
wise [[man]] to, take his leave of [[life]], even in the height of [[prosperity]],
if he do it opportunely; and in a [[fool]] to prolong it, though he be
miserable, provided he be not indigent of those things which they repute
to be according to [[nature]].  as i do not offend the [[law]] against thieves
when i embezzle my own [[money]] and cut my own purse; nor that against
incendiaries when i burn my own wood; so am i not under the lash of those
made against murderers for having deprived myself of my own [[life]].
hegesias said, that as the condition of [[life]] did, so the condition of
death ought to depend upon our own [[choice]].  and diogenes meeting the
philosopher speusippus, so blown up with an inveterate dropsy that he was
fain to be carried in a litter, and by him saluted with the compliment,
“i [[wish]] you [[good]] health.”  “no health to thee,” replied the other,
“who art [[arts]] content to [[live]] in such a condition.”

and in [[fact]], not long after, speusippus, weary of so languishing a state
of [[life]], found a means to [[die]].

but this does not pass without admitting a dispute: for many are of
opinion that we cannot quit this garrison of the [[world]] without the
express command of him who has placed us in it; and that it appertains to
god who has placed us here, not for ourselves only but for his [[glory]] and
the service of others, to dismiss us when it shall [[best]] please him, and
not for us to depart without his licence: that we are not born for
ourselves only, but for our [[country]] also, the laws [[law]] of which require an
account from us upon the score of their own interest, and have an action
of manslaughter [[good]] against us; and if these fail to take cognisance of
the [[fact]], we are punished in the other [[world]] as deserters of our [[duty]]:

         “proxima deinde tenent maesti loca, qui sibi letum
          insontes peperere manu, lucemque perosi
          proiecere animas.”

     [“thence the [[sad]] ones occupy the next abodes, who, though free
     from guilt, were by their own hands slain, and, hating [[light]],
     sought [[death]].”--aeneid, vi. 434.]

there is more constancy in suffering the chain we are tied to than in
breaking it, and more pregnant evidence of fortitude in regulus than in
cato; ‘tis indiscretion and [[impatience]] that push us on to these
precipices: no accidents can make true [[virtue]] turn her back; she seeks
and requires evils [[evil]], pains [[pain]], and [[grief]], as the things by which she is
nourished and supported; the menaces of tyrants [[tyrant]], racks, and tortures
serve only to animate and rouse her:

              “duris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus
               nigrae feraci frondis in algido,
               per damma, percmdes, ab ipso
               ducit opes, animumque ferro.”

     [“as in mount algidus, the sturdy oak even from the axe itself
     derives new vigour and [[life]].”--horace, od., iv. 4, 57.]

and as another says:

              “non est, ut putas, virtus, pater,
               timere vitam; sed malis ingentibus
               obstare, nec se vertere, ac retro dare.”

     [“father, ‘tis no [[virtue]] to [[fear]] [[life]], but to withstand great
     misfortunes, nor turn back from them.”--seneca, theb., i. 190.]

or as this:

          “rebus in adversis facile est contemnere mortem
          fortius ille facit, qui miser esse potest.”

     [“it is easy in adversity to despise [[death]]; but he acts more
     bravely, who can [[live]] wretched.”--martial, xi. 56, 15.]

‘tis cowardice, not [[virtue]], to [[lie]] squat in a furrow, under a tomb, to
evade the blows of [[fortune]]; [[virtue]] never stops nor goes out of her path,
for the [[greatest]] storm that blows:

                    “si fractus illabatur orbis,
                    impavidum ferient ruinae.”

     [“should the world’s axis crack, the ruins will but crush
      a fearless head.”--horace, od., iii. 3, 7.]

for the most part, the flying from other inconveniences brings us to
this; nay, endeavouring to evade [[death]], we often run into its very mouth:

          “hic, rogo, non furor est, ne moriare, mori?”

     [“tell me, is it not madness, that one should [[die]] for fear
     of dying?”--martial, ii. 80, 2.]

like those who, from [[fear]] of a precipice, throw themselves headlong into
it;

              “multos in summa pericula misfit
               venturi timor ipse mali: fortissimus ille est,
               qui promptus metuenda pati, si cominus instent,
               et differre potest.”

     [“the [[fear]] of future ills often makes [[men]] run into extreme danger;
     he is truly brave who boldly dares withstand the mischiefs he
     apprehends, when they confront him and can be deferred.”
      --lucan, vii. 104.]

               “usque adeo, mortis formidine, vitae
               percipit humanos odium, lucisque videndae,
               ut sibi consciscant moerenti pectore lethum
               obliti fontem curarum hunc esse timorem.”

     [“death to that [[degree]] so frightens some [[men]], that causing them to
     hate both [[life]] and [[light]], they kill themselves, miserably forgetting
     that this same [[fear]] is the fountain of their cares [[care]].”
      --lucretius, iii. 79.]

plato, in his laws [[law]], assigns an ignominious sepulture to him who has
deprived his nearest and [[best]] friend, namely himself, of [[life]] and his
destined course, being neither compelled so to do by [[public]] [[judgment]],
by any [[sad]] and inevitable accident of [[fortune]], nor by any insupportable
disgrace, but merely pushed on by cowardice and the imbecility of a
timorous [[soul]].  and the [[opinion]] that makes so little of [[life]], is
ridiculous; for it is our being, ‘tis all we have.  things of a nobler
and more elevated being may, indeed, reproach ours; but it is against
nature for us to contemn and make little account of ourselves; ‘tis a
disease particular to [[man]], and not discerned in any other creatures, to
hate and despise itself.  and it is a vanity of the same stamp to desire
to be something else than what we are; the effect of such a [[desire]] does
not at all touch us, forasmuch as it is contradicted and hindered in
itself.  he that desires [[desire]] of a [[man]] to be made an angel, does nothing for
himself; he would be never the [[better]] for it; for, being no more, who
shall rejoice or be sensible of this benefit for him.

         “debet enim, misere cui forti, aegreque futurum est,
          ipse quoque esse in eo turn tempore, cum male possit
          accidere.”

     [“for he to whom misery and [[pain]] are to be in the future, must
     himself then [[exist]], when these ills befall him.”
      --idem, ibid., 874.]

security, indolence, impassability, the privation of the evils [[evil]] of this
life, which we pretend to purchase at the price of dying, are of no
manner of advantage to us: that [[man]] evades [[war]] to very little [[purpose]] who
can have no fruition of [[peace]]; and as little to the [[purpose]] does he avoid
trouble who cannot enjoy repose.

amongst those of the first of these two opinions [[opinion]], there has been great
debate, what occasions [[occasion]] are sufficient to justify the meditation of
self-murder, which they call “a reasonable exit.”--[ diogenes laertius,
life of zeno.]--for though they say that [[men]] must often [[die]] for trivial
causes, seeing those that detain us in [[life]] are of no very [[great]] weight,
yet there is to be some limit.  there are fantastic and senseless humours
that have prompted not only [[individual]] [[men]], but whole nations to destroy
themselves, of which i have elsewhere given some examples [[example]]; and we further
read of the milesian virgins, that by a frantic compact they hanged
themselves one after another till the magistrate took order in it,
enacting that the bodies [[body]] of such as should be found so [[hanged]] should be
drawn by the same halter stark naked through the [[city]].  when therykion
tried to persuade cleomenes to despatch himself, by [[reason]] of the ill
posture of his affairs, and, having missed a [[death]] of more [[honour]] in the
battle he had lost, to accept of this the second in [[honour]] to it, and not
to give the conquerors leisure to make him undergo either an ignominious
death or an infamous [[life]]; cleomenes, with a [[courage]] truly stoic and
lacedaemonian, rejected his counsel as unmanly and mean; “that,” said he,
“is a remedy that can never be wanting, but which a [[man]] is never to make
use of, whilst there is an inch of [[hope]] remaining”: telling him, “that
it was sometimes constancy and valour to [[live]]; that he would that even
his [[death]] should be of use to his [[country]], and would make of it an act of
honour and [[virtue]].”  therykion, notwithstanding, [[thought]] himself in the
right, and did his own [[business]]; and cleomenes afterwards did the same,
but not till he had first tried the utmost malevolence of [[fortune]].  all
the inconveniences in the [[world]] are not considerable enough that a man
should [[die]] to evade them; and, besides, there being so many, so sudden
and unexpected changes [[change]] in [[human]] things, it is hard rightly to [[judge]] when
we are at the end of our [[hope]]:

              “sperat et in saeva victus gladiator arena,
               sit licet infesto pollice turba minax.”

     [“the gladiator conquered in the lists hopes [[hope]] on, though the
     menacing spectators, turning their thumb, order him to [[die]].”
      --pentadius, de spe, ap. virgilii catadecta.]

all things, says an old adage, are to be hoped for by a [[man]] whilst he
lives; ay, but, replies seneca, why should this rather be always running
in a man’s head that [[fortune]] can do all things for the living [[man]], than
this, that [[fortune]] has no [[power]] over him that knows [[know]] how to [[die]]?
josephus, when engaged in so near and apparent danger, a whole people
being violently bent against him, that there was no visible means of
escape, nevertheless, being, as he himself says, in this extremity
counselled by one of his [[friends]] to despatch himself, it was well for him
that he yet maintained himself in [[hope]], for [[fortune]] diverted the accident
beyond all [[human]] expectation, so that he saw himself delivered without
any manner of inconvenience.  whereas brutus and cassius, on the
contrary, threw away the remains of the roman [[liberty]], of which they were
the sole protectors, by the precipitation and temerity wherewith they
killed themselves before the due [[time]] and a just [[occasion]].  monsieur
d’anguien, at the [[battle]] of serisolles, twice attempted to run himself
through, despairing of the [[fortune]] of the day, which went indeed very
untowardly on that side of the field where he was engaged, and by that
precipitation was very near depriving himself of the enjoyment of so
brave a [[victory]].  i have seen a hundred hares escape out of the very
teeth of the greyhounds:

               “aliquis carnifici suo superstes fuit.”

     [“some have survived their executioners.”--seneca, ep., 13.]

              “multa dies, variusque labor mutabilis nevi
               rettulit in melius; multos alterna revisens
               lusit, et in solido rursus fortuna locavit.”

     [“length of days, and the various [[labour]] of changeful [[time]], have
     brought things to a [[better]] [[state]]; [[fortune]] turning, shews a reverse
     face, and again restores [[men]] to [[prosperity]].”--aeneid, xi. 425.]

piny says there are but three sorts of diseases, to escape which a man
has [[good]] title to [[destroy]] himself; the worst of which is the stone in the
bladder, when the urine is suppressed.

     [“in the quarto edition of these essays, in 1588, pliny is said to
     mention two more, viz., a [[pain]] in the stomach and a headache, which,
     he says (lib. xxv. c. 9.), were the only three distempers almost
     for which [[men]] killed themselves.”]

seneca says those only which for a long [[time]] are discomposing the
functions of the [[soul]].  and some there have been who, to avoid a worse
death, have chosen one to their own liking.  democritus, general of the
aetolians, being brought [[prisoner]] to [[rome]], found means to make his escape
by night: but close pursued by his keepers, rather than suffer himself to
be retaken, he fell upon his own [[sword]] and died.  antinous and theodotus,
their [[city]] of epirus being reduced by the romans to the [[last]] extremity,
gave the [[people]] counsel universally to kill themselves; but, these
preferring to give themselves up to the [[enemy]], the two chiefs [[chief]] went to
seek the [[death]] they [[desired]], rushing furiously upon the [[enemy]], with
intention to strike [[home]] but not to ward a blow.  the island of gozzo
being taken some years ago by the turks, a sicilian, who had two
beautiful daughters [[daughter]] marriageable, killed them both with his own hand, and
their [[mother]], running in to save them, to boot, which having done,
sallying out of the house with a cross-bow and harquebus, with two shots
he killed two of the turks nearest to his door, and drawing his [[sword]],
charged furiously in amongst the rest, where he was suddenly enclosed and
cut to pieces, by that means delivering his [[family]] and himself from
slavery and dishonour.  the jewish [[women]], after having circumcised their
children, threw them and themselves down a precipice to avoid the cruelty
of antigonus.  i have been told of a [[person]] of condition in one of our
prisons, that his [[friends]], being informed that he would certainly be
condemned, to avoid the ignominy of such a [[death]] suborned a [[priest]] to
tell him that the only means of his deliverance was to recommend himself
to such a saint, under such and such vows, and to fast eight days
together without taking any manner of nourishment, what weakness or
faintness soever he might find in himself during the [[time]]; he followed
their [[advice]], and by that means destroyed himself before he was aware,
not dreaming of [[death]] or any danger in the experiment.  scribonia
advising her nephew libo to kill himself rather than await the stroke of
justice, told him that it was to do other people’s [[business]] to preserve
his [[life]] to put it after into the hands of those who within three or four
days would fetch him to execution, and that it was to serve his enemies
to keep his [[blood]] to gratify their malice.

we [[read]] in the bible that nicanor, the persecutor of the [[law]] of [[god]],
having sent his soldiers to seize upon the [[good]] old [[man]] razis, surnamed
in [[honour]] of his [[virtue]] the [[father]] of the [[jews]]: the [[good]] [[man]], seeing no
other remedy, his gates burned down, and the enemies [[enemy]] ready to seize him,
choosing rather to [[die]] nobly than to fall into the hands of his wicked
adversaries and suffer himself to be cruelly butchered by them, contrary
to the [[honour]] of his rank and quality, stabbed himself with his own
sword, but the blow, for haste, not having been given [[home]], he ran and
threw himself from the top of a wall headlong among them, who separating
themselves and making room, he pitched directly upon his head;
notwithstanding which, feeling yet in himself some remains of [[life]], he
renewed his [[courage]], and starting up upon his feet all bloody and wounded
as he was, and making his way through the crowd to a precipitous rock,
there, through one of his wounds, drew out his bowels, which, tearing and
pulling to pieces with both his hands, he threw amongst his pursuers, all
the while attesting and invoking the [[divine]] vengeance upon them for their
cruelty and [[injustice]].

of violences offered to the [[conscience]], that against the chastity of
woman is, in my [[opinion]], most to be avoided, forasmuch as there is a
certain [[pleasure]] naturally mixed with it, and for that [[reason]] the dissent
therein cannot be sufficiently [[perfect]] and entire, so that the violence
seems to be mixed with a little [[consent]] of the forced party.  the
ecclesiastical [[history]] has several examples [[example]] of devout persons [[person]] who have
embraced [[death]] to secure them from the outrages prepared by tyrants
against their [[religion]] and [[honour]].  pelagia and sophronia, both
canonised, the first of these precipitated herself with her [[mother]] and
sisters into the river to avoid being forced by some soldiers, and the
last also killed herself to avoid being ravished by the emperor
maxentius.

it may, peradventure, be an [[honour]] to us in future ages [[age]], that a learned
author of this [[present]] [[time]], and a parisian, takes a [[great]] deal of pains
to persuade the ladies [[lady]] of our [[age]] rather to take any other course than to
enter into the horrid meditation of such a despair.  i am [[sorry]] he had
never heard, that he might have inserted it amongst his other stories,
the saying of a woman, which was told me at toulouse, who had passed
through the handling of some soldiers: “god be praised,” said she, “that
once at least in my [[life]] i have had my fill without [[sin]].”  in [[truth]],
these cruelties are very unworthy the french [[good]] [[nature]], and also, god
be thanked, our air is very well purged of them since this [[good]] [[advice]]:
‘tis enough that they say “no” in doing it, according to the [[rule]] of the
good marot.

              “un doulx nenny, avec un doulx sourire
               est tant honneste.”--marot.

history is everywhere full of those who by a thousand ways have exchanged
a painful and irksome [[life]] for [[death]].  lucius aruntius killed himself, to
fly, he said, both the future and the [[past]].  granius silvanus and statius
proximus, after having been pardoned by nero, killed themselves; either
disdaining to [[live]] by the favour of so wicked a [[man]], or that they might
not be troubled, at some other [[time]], to obtain a second pardon,
considering the proclivity of his [[nature]] to suspect and credit
accusations against worthy [[men]].  spargapises, [[son]] of queen tomyris, being
a [[prisoner]] of [[war]] to cyrus, made use of the first favour cyrus shewed
him, in commanding him to be unbound, to kill himself, having pretended
to no other benefit of [[liberty]], but only to be revenged of himself for
the disgrace of being taken.  boges, governor in eion for [[king]] xerxes,
being besieged by the athenian [[army]] under the conduct of cimon, refused
the conditions offered, that he might safe return into [[asia]] with all his
wealth, impatient to survive the loss of a place his master had given him
to keep; wherefore, having defended the [[city]] to the [[last]] extremity,
nothing being left to [[eat]], he first threw all the gold and whatever else
the [[enemy]] could make booty of into the river strymon, and then causing a
great pile to be set on [[fire]], and the throats of all the [[women]], [[children]],
concubines, and servants to be cut, he threw their bodies [[body]] into the [[fire]],
and at [[last]] leaped into it himself.

ninachetuen, an [[indian]] [[lord]], so soon as he heard the first whisper of the
portuguese viceroy’s determination to dispossess him, without any
apparent cause, of his command in malacca, to transfer it to the [[king]] of
campar, he took this resolution with himself: he caused a scaffold, more
long than broad, to be erected, supported by columns royally adorned with
tapestry and strewed with flowers and abundance of perfumes; all which
being prepared, in a robe of cloth of gold, set full of jewels of great
value, he came out into the street, and mounted the steps to the
scaffold, at one corner of which he had a pile lighted of aromatic wood.
everybody ran to see to what end these unusual preparations were made;
when ninachetuen, with a manly but displeased countenance, set forth how
much he had obliged the portuguese nation, and with how unspotted
fidelity he had carried himself in his charge; that having so often,
sword in hand, manifested in the behalf of others, that [[honour]] was much
more dear to him than [[life]], he was not to abandon the concern of it for
himself: that [[fortune]] denying him all means of opposing the affront
designed to be put upon him, his [[courage]] at least enjoined him to free
himself from the sense of it, and not to serve for a fable to the [[people]],
nor for a triumph to [[men]] less deserving than himself; which having said
he leaped into the [[fire]].

sextilia, [[wife]] of scaurus, and paxaea, [[wife]] of labeo, to encourage their
husbands to avoid the dangers that pressed upon them, wherein they had no
other share than conjugal affection, voluntarily sacrificed their own
lives to serve them in this extreme necessity for company and [[example]].
what they did for their husbands, cocceius nerva did for his [[country]],
with less utility though with [[equal]] affection: this [[great]] lawyer,
flourishing in health, riches [[rich]], [[reputation]], and favour with the [[emperor]],
had no other cause to kill himself but the sole compassion of the
miserable [[state]] of the roman [[republic]].  nothing can be added to the
beauty of the [[death]] of the [[wife]] of fulvius, a familiar favourite of
augustus: augustus having discovered that he had vented an important
secret he had entrusted him withal, one morning that he came to make his
court, received him very coldly and looked frowningly upon him.  he
returned [[home]], full of, despair, where he sorrowfully told his [[wife]] that,
having fallen into this misfortune, he was resolved to kill himself: to
which she roundly replied, “‘tis but [[reason]] you should, seeing that
having so often experienced the incontinence of my tongue, you could not
take warning: but let me kill myself first,” and without any more saying
ran herself through the [[body]] with a [[sword]].  vibius virrius, despairing of
the safety of his [[city]] besieged by the romans and of their [[mercy]], in the
last deliberation of his city’s senate, after many arguments conducing to
that end, concluded that the most [[noble]] means to escape [[fortune]] was by
their own hands: telling them that the [[enemy]] would have them in [[honour]],
and hannibal would be sensible how many faithful [[friends]] he had
abandoned; inviting those who approved of his [[advice]] to come to a good
supper he had ready at [[home]], where after they had eaten well, they would
drink together of what he had prepared; a beverage, said he, that will
deliver our bodies [[body]] from torments, our souls [[soul]] from insult, and our [[eyes]] and
ears from the sense of so many hateful mischiefs, as the conquered suffer
from cruel and implacable conquerors.  i have, said he, taken order for
fit persons [[person]] to throw our bodies [[body]] into a [[funeral]] pile before my door so
soon as we are [[dead]].  many enough approved this high resolution, but few
imitated it; seven-and-twenty senators followed him, who, after having
tried to drown the [[thought]] of this fatal determination in wine, ended the
feast with the mortal mess; and embracing one another, after they had
jointly deplored the misfortune of their [[country]], some retired [[home]] to
their own houses, others stayed to be burned with vibius in his funeral
pyre; and were all of them so long in dying, the vapour of the wine
having prepossessed the veins, and by that means deferred the effect of
poison, that some of them were within an hour of seeing the [[enemy]] inside
the walls of capua, which was taken the next morning, and of undergoing
the miseries they had at so dear a rate endeavoured to avoid.  jubellius
taurea, another citizen of the same [[country]], the consul fulvius returning
from the shameful butchery he had made of two hundred and twenty-five
senators, called him back fiercely by name, and having made him stop:
“give the word,” said he, “that somebody may dispatch me after the
massacre of so many others, that thou mayest boast to have killed a much
more valiant [[man]] than thyself.”  fulvius, disdaining him as a [[man]] out of
his wits, and also having received letters from [[rome]] censuring the
inhumanity of his execution which tied his hands, jubellius proceeded:
“since my [[country]] has been taken, my [[friends]] [[dead]], and having with my own
hands slain my [[wife]] and [[children]] to rescue them from the desolation of
this ruin, i am denied to [[die]] the [[death]] of my fellow-citizens, let me
borrow from [[virtue]] vengeance on this hated [[life]],” and therewithal drawing
a short [[sword]] he carried concealed about him, he ran it through his own
bosom, falling down backward, and expiring at the consul’s feet.

alexander, laying siege to a [[city]] of the indies, those within, finding
themselves very hardly set, put on a vigorous resolution to deprive him
of the [[pleasure]] of his [[victory]], and accordingly burned themselves in
general, together with their [[city]], in despite of his [[humanity]]: a new kind
of [[war]], where the enemies [[enemy]] sought to save them, and they to destroy
themselves, doing to make themselves sure of [[death]], all that [[men]] do to
secure [[life]].

astapa, a [[city]] of [[spain]], finding itself [[weak]] in walls and defence to
withstand the romans, the inhabitants made a heap of all their riches [[rich]] and
furniture in the [[public]] place; and, having ranged upon this heap all the
women and [[children]], and piled them round with wood and other combustible
matter to take sudden [[fire]], and left fifty of their [[young]] [[men]] for the
execution of that whereon they had resolved, they made a desperate sally,
where for want of [[power]] to overcome, they caused themselves to be every
man slain.  the fifty, after having massacred every living soul
throughout the whole [[city]], and put [[fire]] to this pile, threw themselves
lastly into it, finishing their generous [[liberty]], rather after an
insensible, than after a sorrowful and disgraceful manner, giving the
enemy to [[understand]], that if [[fortune]] had been so pleased, they had as
well the [[courage]] to snatch from them [[victory]] as they had to frustrate and
render it dreadful, and even mortal to those who, allured by the
splendour of the gold melting in this flame, having approached it,
a [[great]] number were there suffocated and burned, being kept from retiring
by the crowd that followed after.

the abydeans, being pressed by [[king]] philip, put on the same resolution;
but, not having [[time]], they could not put it ‘in effect.  the [[king]], who
was struck with [[horror]] at the rash precipitation of this execution (the
treasure and movables that they had condemned to the flames being first
seized), drawing off his soldiers, granted them three days’ [[time]] to kill
themselves in, that they might do it with more order and at greater ease:
which [[time]] they filled with [[blood]] and slaughter beyond the utmost excess
of all hostile [[cruelty]], so that not so much as any one [[soul]] was left
alive that had [[power]] to [[destroy]] itself.  there are infinite examples [[example]] of
like popular resolutions which seem the more fierce and cruel in
proportion as the effect is more universal, and yet are really less so
than when singly executed; what arguments and persuasion cannot do with
individual [[men]], they can do with all, the ardour of [[society]] ravishing
particular judgments [[judgment]].

the condemned who would [[live]] to be executed in the reign of tiberius,
forfeited their goods [[good]] and were denied the rites of sepulture; those who,
by killing themselves, anticipated it, were interred, and had [[liberty]] to
dispose of their estates by will.

but [[men]] sometimes covet [[death]] out of [[hope]] of a greater [[good]].  “i [[desire]],”
 says st. paul, “to be with [[christ]],” and “who shall rid me of these
bands?”  cleombrotus of ambracia, having [[read]] plato’s pheedo, entered
into so [[great]] a [[desire]] of the [[life]] to come that, without any other
occasion, he threw himself into the sea.  by which it appears how
improperly we call this voluntary dissolution, despair, to which the
eagerness of [[hope]] often inclines us, and, often, a calm and temperate
desire proceeding from a mature and deliberate [[judgment]].  jacques du
chastel, bishop of soissons, in st. louis’s [[foreign]] expedition, seeing
the [[king]] and whole [[army]] upon the point of returning into [[france]], leaving
the affairs of [[religion]] imperfect, took a resolution rather to go into
paradise; wherefore, having taken solemn leave of his [[friends]], he charged
alone, in the sight of every one, into the enemy’s [[army]], where he was
presently cut to pieces.  in a [[certain]] [[kingdom]] of the new discovered
world, upon a day of solemn procession, when the idol they adore is drawn
about in [[public]] upon a chariot of marvellous greatness; besides that many
are then seen cutting off pieces of their flesh to offer to him, there
are a number of others who prostrate themselves upon the place, causing
themselves to be crushed and broken to pieces under the weighty wheels,
to obtain the veneration of [[sanctity]] after [[death]], which is accordingly
paid them.  the [[death]] of the bishop, [[sword]] in hand, has more of
magnanimity in it, and less of sentiment, the ardour of combat taking
away part of the latter.

there are some governments [[government]] who have taken upon them to regulate the
justice and opportunity of voluntary [[death]].  in former times [[time]] there was
kept in our [[city]] of marseilles a poison prepared out of hemlock, at the
public charge, for those who had a [[mind]] to hasten their end, having
first, before the six hundred, who were their senate, given account of
the reasons [[reason]] and motives of their design, and it was not otherwise lawful,
than by leave from the magistrate and upon just [[occasion]] to do violence
to themselves.--[valerius maximus, ii. 6, 7.]--the same [[law]] was also
in use in other places.

sextus pompeius, in his expedition into [[asia]], touched at the isle of cea
in negropont: it happened whilst he was there, as we have it from one
that was with him, that a woman of [[great]] quality, having given an account
to her [[citizens]] why she was resolved to put an end to her [[life]], invited
pompeius to her [[death]], to render it the more honourable, an invitation
that he accepted; and having long tried in [[vain]] by the [[power]] of his
eloquence, which was very [[great]], and persuasion, to divert her from that
design, he acquiesced in the end in her own will.  she had passed the age
of four score and ten in a very [[happy]] [[state]], both of [[body]] and [[mind]]; being
then laid upon her bed, [[better]] dressed than ordinary and leaning upon her
elbow, “the gods,” said she, “o sextus pompeius, and rather those i leave
than those i go to seek, [[reward]] thee, for that thou hast not disdained to
be both the counsellor of my [[life]] and the witness of my [[death]].  for my
part, having always experienced the smiles of [[fortune]], for [[fear]] lest the
desire of living too long may make me see a contrary face, i am going, by
a [[happy]] end, to dismiss the remains of my [[soul]], leaving behind two
daughters of my [[body]] and a legion of nephews”; which having said, with
some exhortations to her [[family]] to [[live]] in [[peace]], she divided amongst
them her goods [[good]], and recommending her domestic gods to her eldest
daughter, she boldly took the bowl that contained the poison, and having
made her vows and prayers to mercury to conduct her to some [[happy]] abode
in the other [[world]], she roundly swallowed the mortal poison.  this being
done, she entertained the company with the [[progress]] of its operation, and
how the cold by degrees [[degree]] seized the several parts of her [[body]] one after
another, till having in the end told them it began to seize upon her
heart and bowels, she called her daughters [[daughter]] to do the [[last]] office and
close her [[eyes]].

pliny tells us of a [[certain]] hyperborean nation where, by [[reason]] of the
sweet temperature of the air, lives [[life]] rarely ended but by the voluntary
surrender of the inhabitants, who, being weary of and satiated with
living, had the custom, at a very old [[age]], after having made [[good]] cheer,
to precipitate themselves into the sea from the top of a [[certain]] rock,
assigned for that service.  [[pain]] and the [[fear]] of a worse [[death]] seem to me
the most excusable incitements.




chapter iv

to-morrow’s a new day

i give, as it seems to me, with [[good]] [[reason]] the palm to jacques amyot of
all our french writers, not only for the simplicity and purity of his
language, wherein he excels all others, nor for his constancy in going
through so long a [[work]],  nor for the depth of his [[knowledge]], having been
able so successfully to smooth and unravel so knotty and intricate an
author (for let [[people]] tell me what they will, i [[understand]] nothing of
greek; but i meet with sense so well [[united]] and maintained throughout his
whole translation, that certainly he either knew the true fancy of the
author, or having, by being long conversant with him, imprinted a vivid
and general [[idea]] of that of plutarch in his [[soul]], he has delivered us
nothing that either derogates from or contradicts him), but above all, i
am the most taken with him for having made so discreet a [[choice]] of a book
so worthy and of so [[great]] utility wherewith to [[present]] his [[country]].  we
ignorant fellows had been lost, had not this [[book]] raised us out of the
dirt; by this favour of his we dare now speak and write; the ladies [[lady]] are
able to [[read]] to schoolmasters; ‘tis our breviary.  if this [[good]] [[man]] be
yet living, i would recommend to him xenophon, to do as much by that;
‘tis a much more easy task than the other, and consequently more proper
for his [[age]].  and, besides, though i [[know]] not how, methinks he does
briskly--and clearly enough trip over steps another would have stumbled
at, yet nevertheless his style seems to be more his own where he does not
encounter those difficulties, and rolls away at his own ease.

i was just now reading this passage where plutarch says of himself, that
rusticus being [[present]] at a declamation of his at [[rome]], there received a
packet from the [[emperor]], and deferred to open it till all was done: for
which, says he, all the company highly applauded the gravity of this
person.  ‘tis true, that being upon the [[subject]] of curiosity and of that
eager passion for news, which makes us with so much indiscretion and
impatience leave all to entertain a newcomer, and without any manner of
respect or outcry, tear open on a sudden, in what company soever, the
letters that are delivered to us, he had [[reason]] to applaud the gravity of
rusticus upon this [[occasion]]; and might moreover have added to it the
commendation of his civility and courtesy, that would not interrupt the
current of his declamation.  but i [[doubt]] whether any one can commend his
prudence; for receiving unexpected letters, and especially from an
emperor, it might have fallen out that the deferring to [[read]] them might
have been of [[great]] prejudice.  the [[vice]] opposite to curiosity is
negligence, to which i naturally incline, and wherein i have seen some
men so extreme that one might have found letters sent them three or four
days before, still sealed up in their pockets.

i never open any letters directed to another; not only those intrusted
with me, but even such as [[fortune]] has guided to my hand; and am angry
with myself if my [[eyes]] unawares steal any contents of letters of
importance he is reading when i stand near a [[great]] [[man]].  never was man
less inquisitive or less prying into other [[men’s]] affairs than i.

in our fathers’ days, monsieur de boutieres had like to have lost turin
from having, while engaged in [[good]] company at supper, delayed to read
information that was sent him of the [[treason]] plotted against that city
where he commanded.  and this very plutarch has given me to [[understand]],
that julius caesar had preserved himself, if, going to the senate the day
he was assassinated by the conspirators, he had [[read]] a note which was
presented to him by, the way.  he tells also the story of archias, the
tyrant of thebes, that the night before the execution of the design
pelopidas had plotted to kill him to restore his [[country]] to [[liberty]], he
had a full account sent him in writing by another archias, an athenian,
of the whole conspiracy, and that, this packet having been delivered to
him while he sat at supper, he deferred the opening of it, saying, which
afterwards turned to a proverb in greece, “business to-morrow.”

a [[wise]] [[man]] may, i [[think]], out of [[respect]] to another, as not to disturb the
company, as rusticus did, or not to break off another affair of
importance in hand, defer to [[read]] or hear any new thing that is brought
him; but for his own interest or particular [[pleasure]], especially if he be
a [[public]] minister, that he will not interrupt his dinner or break his
sleep is inexcusable.  and there was anciently at [[rome]], the consular
place, as they called it, which was the most honourable at the table, as
being a place of most [[liberty]], and of more convenient access to those who
came in to speak to the [[person]] seated there; by which it appears, that
being at meat, they did not totally abandon the concern of other affairs
and incidents.  but when all is said, it is very hard in [[human]] actions to
give so exact a [[rule]] upon [[moral]] reasons [[reason]], that [[fortune]] will not therein
maintain her own [[right]].




chapter v

of conscience

the sieur de la brousse, my [[brother]], and i, travelling one day together
during the [[time]] of our civil wars [[war]], met a gentleman of [[good]] sort.  he was
of the contrary party, though i did not [[know]] so much, for he pretended
otherwise: and the mischief on’t is, that in this sort of [[war]] the cards
are so shuffled, your [[enemy]] not being distinguished from yourself by any
apparent mark either of [[language]] or habit, and being nourished under the
same [[law]], air, and manners, it is very hard to avoid disorder and
confusion.  this made me afraid myself of meeting any of our [[troops]] in a
place where i was not known, that i might not be in [[fear]] to tell my name,
and peradventure of something worse; as it had befallen me before, where,
by such a mistake, i lost both [[men]] and horses, and amongst others an
italian gentleman my page, whom i bred with the [[greatest]] [[care]] and
affection, was miserably slain, in whom a [[youth]] of [[great]] promise and
expectation was extinguished.  but the gentleman my [[brother]] and i met
had so desperate, half-dead a [[fear]] upon him at meeting with any horse,
or passing by any of the towns that held for the [[king]], that i at last
discovered it to be alarms of [[conscience]].  it seemed to the [[poor]] [[man]] as
if through his visor and the crosses upon his cassock, one would have
penetrated into his bosom and [[read]] the most secret intentions of his
heart; so wonderful is the [[power]] of [[conscience]].  it makes us betray,
accuse, and [[fight]] against ourselves, and for want of other witnesses, to
give evidence against ourselves:

               “occultum quatiens animo tortore flagellum.”

     [“the torturer of the [[soul]] brandishing a sharp scourge within.”
      --juvenal, iii. 195.]

this story is in every child’s mouth: bessus the paeonian, being
reproached for wantonly pulling down a nest of [[young]] sparrows and killing
them, replied, that he had [[reason]] to do so, seeing that those little
birds never ceased falsely to accuse him of the murder of his [[father]].
this parricide had till then been concealed and unknown, but the
revenging fury of [[conscience]] caused it to be discovered by him himself,
who was to suffer for it.  hesiod corrects the saying of [[plato]], that
punishment closely follows [[sin]], it being, as he says, born at the same
time with it.  whoever expects [[punishment]] already suffers it, and whoever
has deserved it expects it.  wickedness contrives torments against
itself:

               “malum consilium consultori pessimum.”

               [“ill designs are worst to the contriver.”
                --apud aul. gellium, iv. 5.]

as the wasp stings and hurts another, but most of all itself, for it
there loses its sting and its use for ever,

                    “vitasque in vulnere ponunt.”

               [“and leave their own lives [[life]] in the wound.”
                --virgil, geo., iv. 238.]

cantharides have somewhere about them, by a contrariety of [[nature]], a
counterpoison against their poison.  in like manner, at the same time
that [[men]] take delight in [[vice]], there springs in the [[conscience]] a
displeasure that afflicts us sleeping and waking with various tormenting
imaginations:

              “quippe ubi se multi, per somnia saepe loquentes,
               aut morbo delirantes, protraxe ferantur,
               et celata diu in medium peccata dedisse.”

     [“surely where many, often talking in their sleep, or raving in
     disease, are said to have betrayed themselves, and to have given
     publicity to offences long concealed.”--lucretius, v. 1157.]

apollodorus dreamed that he saw himself flayed by the scythians and
afterwards boiled in a cauldron, and that his [[heart]] muttered these words
“i am the cause of all these mischiefs that have befallen thee.”
 epicurus said that no hiding-hole could conceal the wicked, since they
could never assure themselves of being hid whilst their conscience
discovered them to themselves.

                    “prima est haec ultio, quod se
               judice nemo nocens absohitur.”

     [“tis the first [[punishment]] of [[sin]] that no [[man]] absolves himself.” or:
     “this is the highest [[revenge]], that by its [[judgment]] no offender is
     absolved.”--juvenal, xiii. 2.]

as an ill [[conscience]] fills us with [[fear]], so a [[good]] one gives us greater
confidence and assurance; and i can truly say that i have gone through
several hazards with a more steady pace in consideration of the secret
knowledge i had of my own will and the innocence of my intentions:

         “conscia mens [[men]] ut cuique sua est, ita concipit intra
          pectora pro facto spemque metumque suo.”

     [“as a man’s [[conscience]] is, so within [[hope]] or [[fear]] prevails, suiting
     to his design.”--ovid, fast., i. 485.]

of this are a thousand examples [[example]]; but it will be enough to instance three
of one and the same [[person]].  scipio, being one day accused before the
people of [[rome]] of some crimes of a very high [[nature]], instead of excusing
himself or flattering his judges [[judge]]: “it will become you well,” said he,
“to sit in [[judgment]] upon a head, by whose means you have the [[power]] to
judge all the [[world]].”  another [[time]], all the [[answer]] he gave to several
impeachments brought against him by a tribune of the [[people]], instead of
making his defence: “let us go, [[citizens]],” said he, “let us go render
thanks to the gods for the [[victory]] they gave me over the carthaginians as
this day,” and advancing himself before towards the temple, he had
presently all the assembly and his very accuser himself following at his
heels.  and petilius, having been set on by cato to demand an account of
the [[money]] that had passed through his hands in the province of antioch,
scipio being come into the senate to that [[purpose]], produced a [[book]] from
under his robe, wherein he told them was an exact account of his receipts
and disbursements; but being required to deliver it to the prothonotary
to be examined, he refused, saying, he would not do himself so [[great]] a
disgrace; and in the presence of the whole senate tore the [[book]] with his
own hands to pieces.  i do not [[believe]] that the most seared conscience
could have counterfeited so [[great]] an assurance.  he had naturally too
high a spirit and was accustomed to too high a [[fortune]], says titius
livius, to [[know]] how to be [[criminal]], and to lower himself to the meanness
of defending his innocence.  the putting [[men]] to the rack is a dangerous
invention, and seems to be rather a [[trial]] of patience than of [[truth]].
both he who has the fortitude to endure it conceals the [[truth]], and he who
has not: for why should [[pain]] sooner make me confess what really is, than
force me to say what is not?  and, on the contrary, if he who is not
guilty of that whereof he is accused, has the [[courage]] to undergo those
torments, why should not he who is guilty have the same, so [[fair]] a reward
as [[life]] being in his prospect?  i [[believe]] the ground of this invention
proceeds from the consideration of the [[force]] of [[conscience]]: for, to the
guilty, it seems to assist the rack to make him confess his [[fault]] and to
shake his resolution; and, on the other side, that it fortifies the
innocent against the torture.  but when all is done, ‘tis, in plain
truth, a [[trial]] full of uncertainty and danger what would not a [[man]] say,
what would not a [[man]] do, to avoid so intolerable torments?

               “etiam innocentes cogit mentiri dolor.”

     [“pain will make even the [[innocent]] [[lie]].”--publius syrus, de dolore.]

whence it comes to pass, that him whom the [[judge]] has racked that he may
not [[die]] [[innocent]], he makes him [[die]] both [[innocent]] and racked.  a thousand
and a thousand have charged their own heads by false confessions, amongst
whom i place philotas, considering the circumstances of the trial
alexander put upon him and the [[progress]] of his torture.  but so it is
that some say it is the least [[evil]] [[human]] weakness could invent; very
inhumanly, notwithstanding, and to very little [[purpose]], in my [[opinion]].

many nations less barbarous in this than the greeks [[greek]] and romans who call
them so, repute it horrible and cruel to torment and pull a [[man]] to pieces
for a [[fault]] of which they are yet in [[doubt]].  how can he [[help]] your
ignorance?  are not you [[unjust]], that, not to kill him without cause, do
worse than kill him?  and that this is so, do but observe how often men
prefer to [[die]] without [[reason]] than undergo this examination, more painful
than execution itself; and that oft-times by its extremity anticipates
execution, and perform it.  i [[know]] not where i had this story, but it
exactly matches the [[conscience]] of our [[justice]] in this particular.  a
country-woman, to a general of a very severe discipline, accused one of
his soldiers that he had taken from her [[children]] the little soup meat she
had left to nourish them withal, the [[army]] having consumed all the rest;
but of this proof there was none.  the general, after having cautioned
the woman to take [[good]] heed to what she said, for that she would make
herself guilty of a false accusation if she told a [[lie]], and she
persisting, he presently caused the soldier’s belly to be ripped up to
clear the [[truth]] of the [[fact]], and the woman was found to be [[right]].  an
instructive sentence.




chapter vi

use makes perfect

‘tis not to be expected that argument and instruction, though we never so
voluntarily [[surrender]] our [[belief]] to what is [[read]] to us, should be of
force to lead us on so far as to action, if we do not, over and above,
exercise and form the [[soul]] by [[experience]] to the course for which we
design it; it will, otherwise, doubtless find itself at a loss when it
comes to the pinch of the [[business]].  this is the [[reason]] why those amongst
the [[philosophers]] who were ambitious to attain to a greater excellence,
were not contented to await the severities of [[fortune]] in the retirement
and repose of their own habitations, lest he should have surprised them
raw and inexpert in the combat, but sallied out to meet her, and
purposely threw themselves into the proof of difficulties.  some of them
abandoned riches [[rich]] to exercise themselves in a voluntary [[poverty]]; others
sought out [[labour]] and an austerity of [[life]], to inure them to hardships
and inconveniences; others have deprived themselves of their dearest
members, as of sight, and of the instruments of [[generation]], lest their
too delightful and effeminate service should soften and debauch the
stability of their souls [[soul]].

but in dying, which is the [[greatest]] [[work]] we have to do, practice can give
us no assistance at all.  a [[man]] may by custom fortify himself against
pain, shame, necessity, and such-like accidents, but as to [[death]], we can
experiment it but once, and are all apprentices when we come to it.
there have, anciently, been [[men]] so excellent managers of their [[time]] that
they have tried even in [[death]] itself to relish and taste it, and who have
bent their utmost faculties of [[mind]] to discover what this passage is, but
they are none of them come back to tell us the news:

               “nemo expergitus exstat,
               frigida quern semel est vitai pausa sequuta.”

     [“no one wakes who has once fallen into the cold sleep of [[death]].”
      --lucretius, iii. 942]

julius canus, a [[noble]] roman, of singular constancy and [[virtue]], having
been condemned to [[die]] by that worthless fellow caligula, besides many
marvellous testimonies that he gave of his resolution, as he was just
going to receive the stroke of the executioner, was [[asked]] by a
philosopher, a friend of his: “well, canus, whereabout is your [[soul]] now?
what is she doing?  what are you thinking of?”--“i was thinking,” replied
the other, “to keep myself ready, and the faculties of my [[mind]] full
settled and fixed, to try if in this short and quick instant of [[death]], i
could perceive the motion of the [[soul]] when she parts from the [[body]], and
whether she has any sentiment at the separation, that i may after come
again if i can, to acquaint my [[friends]] with it.”  this [[man]] philosophises
not unto [[death]] only, but in [[death]] itself.  what a [[strange]] assurance was
this, and what bravery of [[courage]], to [[desire]] his [[death]] should be a lesson
to him, and to have leisure to [[think]] of other things in so [[great]] an
affair:

               “jus hoc animi morientis habebat.”

     [“this mighty [[power]] of [[mind]] he had dying.”-lucan, viii. 636.]

and yet i fancy, there is a [[certain]] way of making it familiar to us, and
in some sort of making [[trial]] what it is.  we may gain [[experience]], if not
entire and [[perfect]], yet such, at least, as shall not be totally useless
to us, and that may render us more confident and more assured.  if we
cannot overtake it, we may approach it and view it, and if we do not
advance so far as the fort, we may at least discover and make ourselves
acquainted with the avenues.  it is not without [[reason]] that we are taught
to consider sleep as a resemblance of [[death]]: with how [[great]] facility do
we pass from waking to sleeping, and with how little concern do we lose
the [[knowledge]] of [[light]] and of ourselves.  peradventure, the faculty of
sleeping would seem useless and contrary to [[nature]], since it deprives us
of all action and sentiment, were it not that by it [[nature]] instructs us
that she has equally made us to [[die]] as to [[live]]; and in [[life]] presents [[present]] to
us the eternal [[state]] she reserves for us after it, to accustom us to it
and to take from us the [[fear]] of it.  but such as have by [[violent]] accident
fallen into a swoon, and in it have lost all sense, these, methinks, have
been very near seeing the true and [[natural]] face of [[death]]; for as to the
moment of the passage, it is not to be feared that it brings with it any
pain or displeasure, forasmuch as we can have no feeling without leisure;
our sufferings require [[time]], which in [[death]] is so short, and so
precipitous, that it must necessarily be insensible.  they are the
approaches that we are to [[fear]], and these may fall within the limits of
experience.

many things seem greater by [[imagination]] than they are in effect; i have
passed a [[good]] part of my [[life]] in a [[perfect]] and entire health; i say, not
only entire, but, moreover, sprightly and wanton.  this [[state]], so full of
verdure, jollity, and vigour, made the consideration of sickness so
formidable to me, that when i came to [[experience]] it, i found the attacks
faint and easy in comparison with what i had apprehended.  of this i have
daily [[experience]]; if i am under the shelter of a warm room, in a stormy
and tempestuous night, i wonder how [[people]] can [[live]] abroad, and am
afflicted for those who are out in the fields: if i am there myself, i do
not [[wish]] to be anywhere else.  this one thing of being always shut up in
a chamber i fancied insupportable: but i was presently inured to be so
imprisoned a week, nay a month together, in a very [[weak]], disordered, and
sad condition; and i have found that, in the [[time]] of my health, i much
more pitied the sick, than i [[think]] myself to be pitied when i am so, and
that the [[force]] of my [[imagination]] enhances near one-half of the essence
and reality of the thing.  i [[hope]] that when i come to [[die]] i shall find it
the same, and that, after all, it is not worth the pains [[pain]] i take, so much
preparation and so much assistance as i call in, to undergo the stroke.
but, at all events, we cannot give ourselves too much advantage.

in the [[time]] of our third or second troubles (i do not well remember
which), going one day abroad to take the air, about a league from my own
house, which is seated in the very centre of all the bustle and mischief
of the late civil wars [[war]] in [[france]]; thinking myself in all security and so
near to my retreat that i stood in need of no [[better]] equipage, i had
taken a horse that went very easy upon his pace, but was not very [[strong]].
being upon my return [[home]], a sudden [[occasion]] falling out to make use of
this horse in a [[kind]] of service that he was not accustomed to, one of my
train, a lusty, tall fellow, mounted upon a [[strong]] [[german]] horse, that had
a very ill mouth, fresh and vigorous, to play the brave and set on ahead
of his fellows, comes thundering full speed in the very track where i
was, rushing like a colossus upon the little [[man]] and the little horse,
with such a [[career]] of [[strength]] and weight, that he turned us both over
and over, topsy-turvy with our heels in the air: so that there lay the
horse overthrown and stunned with the fall, and i ten or twelve paces
from him stretched out at length, with my face all battered and broken,
my [[sword]] which i had had in my hand, above ten paces beyond that, and my
belt broken all to pieces, without motion or sense any more than a stock.
‘twas the only swoon i was ever in till that hour in my [[life]].  those who
were with me, after having used all the means they could to bring me to
myself, concluding me [[dead]], took me up in their arms, and carried me with
very much difficulty [[home]] to my house, which was about half a french
league from thence.  on the way, having been for more than two hours
given over for a [[dead]] [[man]], i began to move and to fetch my breath; for so
great abundance of [[blood]] was fallen into my stomach, that [[nature]] had need
to rouse her forces [[force]] to discharge it.  they then raised me upon my feet,
where i threw off a whole bucket of clots of [[blood]], as this i did also
several times [[time]] by the way.  this gave me so much ease, that i began to
recover a little [[life]], but so leisurely and by so small advances, that my
first sentiments were much nearer the approaches of [[death]] than [[life]]:

               “perche, dubbiosa ancor del suo ritorno,
               non s’assicura attonita la mente.”

    [“for the [[soul]], doubtful as to its return, could not compose itself”
      --tasso, gierus.  lib., xii. 74.]

the remembrance of this accident, which is very well imprinted in my
memory, so naturally representing to me the image and [[idea]] of [[death]], has
in some sort reconciled me to that untoward adventure.  when i first
began to open my [[eyes]], it was with so perplexed, so [[weak]] and [[dead]] a
sight, that i could yet distinguish nothing but only discern the [[light]]:

               “come quel ch’or apre, or’chiude
               gli occhi, mezzo tra’l sonno e l’esser desto.”

     [“as a [[man]] that now opens, now shuts his [[eyes]], between sleep
     and waking.”--tasso, gierus.  lib., viii., 26.]

as to the functions of the [[soul]], they advanced with the same pace and
measure with those of the [[body]].  i saw myself all bloody, my doublet
being stained all over with the [[blood]] i had vomited.  the first thought
that came into my [[mind]] was that i had a harquebuss shot in my head, and
indeed, at the [[time]] there were a [[great]] many fired round about us.
methought my [[life]] but just hung upon my, lips: and i shut my [[eyes]], to
help, methought, to thrust it out, and took a [[pleasure]] in languishing and
letting myself go.  it was an [[imagination]] that only superficially floated
upon my [[soul]], as tender and [[weak]] as all the rest, but really, not only
exempt from anything displeasing, but mixed with that sweetness that
people [[feel]] when they glide into a slumber.

i [[believe]] it is the very same condition those [[people]] are in, whom we see
swoon with weakness in the agony of [[death]] we [[pity]] them without cause,
supposing them agitated with grievous dolours, or that their souls [[soul]] suffer
under painful thoughts [[thought]].  it has ever been my [[belief]], contrary to the
opinion of many, and particularly of la boetie, that those whom we see so
subdued and stupefied at the approaches of their end, or [[oppressed]] with
the length of the disease, or by accident of an apoplexy or falling
sickness,

         “vi morbi saepe coactus
          ante oculos aliquis nostros, ut fulminis ictu,
          concidit, et spumas agit; ingemit, et tremit artus;
          desipit, extentat nervos, torquetur, anhelat,
          inconstanter, et in jactando membra fatigat;”

     [“often, compelled by the [[force]] of disease, some one as
     thunderstruck falls under our [[eyes]], and foams, groans, and trembles,
     stretches, twists, breathes irregularly, and in paroxysms wears out
     his [[strength]].”--lucretius, iii. 485.]

or hurt in the head, whom we hear to mutter, and by fits to utter
grievous groans; though we gather from these signs by which it seems as
if they had some remains of [[consciousness]], and that there are movements
of the [[body]]; i have always believed, i say, both the [[body]] and the soul
benumbed and asleep,

               “vivit, et est vitae nescius ipse suae,”

               [“he lives [[life]], and does not [[know]] that he is alive.”
                --ovid, trist., i. 3, 12.]

and could not [[believe]] that in so [[great]] a stupefaction of the members and
so [[great]] a defection of the senses, the [[soul]] could maintain any force
within to take cognisance of herself, and that, therefore, they had no
tormenting reflections to make them consider and be sensible of the
misery of their condition, and consequently were not much to be pitied.

i can, for my part, [[think]] of no [[state]] so insupportable and dreadful, as
to have the [[soul]] vivid and afflicted, without means to declare itself; as
one should say of such as are sent to execution with their tongues first
cut out (were it not that in this [[kind]] of dying, the most silent seems to
me the most graceful, if accompanied with a grave and constant
countenance); or if those miserable prisoners [[prisoner]], who fall into the hands of
the base hangman soldiers of this [[age]], by whom they are tormented with
all sorts of inhuman usage to compel them to some excessive and
impossible ransom; kept, in the meantime, in such condition and place,
where they have no means of expressing or signifying their thoughts [[thought]] and
their misery.  the poets have feigned some gods who favour the
deliverance of such as suffer under a languishing [[death]]:

                              “hunc ego diti
               sacrum jussa fero, teque isto corpore solvo.”

     [“i bidden offer this [[sacred]] thing to pluto, and from that body
     dismiss thee.”--aeneid, iv. 782.]

both the interrupted words, and the short and irregular answers [[answer]] one gets
from them sometimes, by bawling and keeping a clutter about them; or the
motions which seem to yield some [[consent]] to what we would have them do,
are no testimony, nevertheless, that they [[live]], an entire [[life]] at least.
so it happens to us in the yawning of sleep, before it has fully
possessed us, to perceive, as in a [[dream]], what is done about us, and to
follow the [[last]] things that are said with a perplexed and uncertain
hearing which seems but to touch upon the borders of the [[soul]]; and to
make answers [[answer]] to the [[last]] words that have been spoken to us, which have
more in them of [[chance]] than sense.

now seeing i have in effect tried it, i have no [[doubt]] but i have hitherto
made a [[right]] [[judgment]]; for first, being in a swoon, i laboured to rip
open the buttons of my doublet with my nails, for my [[sword]] was gone; and
yet i [[felt]] nothing in my [[imagination]] that hurt me; for we have many
motions in us that do not proceed from our direction;

          “semianimesque micant digiti, ferrumque retractant;”

     [“half-dead fingers grope about, and grasp again the [[sword]].”
      --aeneid, x. 396.]

so falling [[people]] extend their arms before them by a [[natural]] impulse,
which prompts our limbs to offices and motions without any commission
from our [[reason]].

         “falciferos memorant currus abscindere membra .  .  .
          ut tremere in terra videatur ab artubus id quod
          decidit abscissum; cum mens [[men]] tamen atque hominis vis
          mobilitate mali, non quit sentire dolorem.”

     [“they relate that scythe-bearing chariots mow off limbs, so that
     they quiver on the ground; and yet the [[mind]] of him from whom the
     limb is taken by the swiftness of the blow feels [[feel]] no [[pain]].”
      --lucretius, iii. 642.]

my stomach was so [[oppressed]] with the coagulated [[blood]], that my hands
moved to that part, of their own voluntary motion, as they frequently do
to the part that itches, without being directed by our will.  there are
several animals, and even [[men]], in whom one may perceive the muscles to
stir and tremble after they are [[dead]].  every one experimentally knows
that there are some members which grow stiff and flag without his leave.
now, those [[passions]] which only touch the outward bark of us, cannot be
said to be ours: to make them so, there must be a concurrence of the
whole [[man]]; and the pains [[pain]] which are [[felt]] by the hand or the foot while
we are sleeping, are none of ours.

as i drew near my own house, where the alarm of my fall was already got
before me, and my [[family]] were come out to meet me, with the hubbub usual
in such cases, not only did i make some little [[answer]] to some questions
which were [[asked]] me; but they moreover tell me, that i was sufficiently
collected to order them to bring a horse to my [[wife]] whom on the road,
i saw struggling and tiring herself which is hilly and rugged.  this
should seem to proceed from a [[soul]] its functions; but it was nothing so
with me. i knew not what i said or did, and they were nothing but idle
thoughts in the clouds, that were stirred up by the senses of the eyes
and ears, and proceeded not from me.  i knew not for all that, whence i
came or whither i went, neither was i capable to weigh and consider what
was said to me: these were [[light]] effects, that the senses produced of
themselves as of custom; what the [[soul]] contributed was in a [[dream]],
lightly touched, licked and bedewed by the soft impression of the senses.
notwithstanding, my condition was, in [[truth]], very easy and quiet; i had
no affliction upon me, either for others or myself; it was an extreme
languor and weakness, without any manner of [[pain]].  i saw my own house,
but knew it not.  when they had put me to bed i found an inexpressible
sweetness in that repose; for i had been desperately tugged and lugged by
those [[poor]] [[people]] who had taken the pains [[pain]] to carry me upon their arms a
very [[great]] and a very rough way, and had in so doing all quite tired out
themselves, twice or thrice one after another.  they offered me several
remedies, but i would take none, certainly believing that i was mortally
wounded in the head.  and, in earnest, it had been a very [[happy]] [[death]],
for the weakness of my understanding deprived me of the faculty of
discerning, and that of my [[body]] of the sense of feeling; i was suffering
myself to glide away so sweetly and after so soft and easy a manner, that
i scarce find any other action less troublesome than that was.  but when
i came again to myself and to resume my faculties:

               “ut tandem sensus convaluere mei,”

          [“when at length my lost senses again returned.”
           --ovid, trist., i. 3, 14.]

which was two or three hours after, i [[felt]] myself on a sudden involved in
terrible [[pain]], having my limbs battered and ground with my fall, and was.
so ill for two or three nights after, that i [[thought]] i was once more
dying again, but a more painful [[death]], having concluded myself as [[good]] as
dead before, and to this hour am sensible of the bruises of that terrible
shock.  i will not here omit, that the [[last]] thing i could make them beat
into my head, was the memory of this accident, and i had it over and over
again repeated to me, whither i was going, from whence i came, and at
what [[time]] of the day this mischance befell me, before i could comprehend
it.  as to the manner of my fall, that was concealed from me in favour to
him who had been the [[occasion]], and other flim-flams were [[invented]].  but a
long [[time]] after, and the very next day that my memory began to return and
to represent to me the [[state]] wherein i was, at the instant that i
perceived this horse coming full drive upon me (for i had seen him at my
heels, and gave myself for gone, but this [[thought]] had been so sudden,
that [[fear]] had had no leisure to introduce itself) it seemed to me like a
flash of lightning that had pierced my [[soul]], and that i came from the
other [[world]].

this long story of so [[light]] an accident would appear [[vain]] enough, were it
not for the [[knowledge]] i have gained by it for my own use; for i do really
find, that to get acquainted with [[death]], needs no more but nearly to
approach it.  every one, as pliny says, is a [[good]] doctrine to himself,
provided he be capable of discovering himself near at hand.  here, this
is not my doctrine, ‘tis my study; and is not the lesson of another, but
my own; and if i communicate it, it ought not to be ill taken, for that
which is of use to me, may also, peradventure, be useful to another.  as
to the rest, i spoil nothing, i make use of nothing but my own; and if i
play the [[fool]], ‘tis at my own expense, and nobody else is concerned in’t;
for ‘tis a folly that will [[die]] with me, and that no one is to inherit.
we hear but of two or three of the ancients, who have beaten this path,
and yet i cannot say if it was after this manner, knowing no more of them
but their names.  no one since has followed the track: ‘tis a rugged
road, more so than it seems, to [[follow]] a pace so rambling and uncertain,
as that of the [[soul]]; to penetrate the dark profundities of its intricate
internal windings; to choose and lay hold of so many little nimble
motions; ‘tis a new and extraordinary undertaking, and that withdraws us
from the [[common]] and most recommended employments of the [[world]].  ‘tis now
many years since that my thoughts [[thought]] have had no other aim and level than
myself, and that i have only pried into and [[studied]] myself: or, if i
study any other thing, ‘tis to apply it to or rather in myself.  and yet
i do not [[think]] it a [[fault]], if, as others do by other much less profitable
sciences, i communicate what i have learned in this, though i am not very
well pleased with my own [[progress]].  there is no description so difficult,
nor doubtless of so [[great]] utility, as that of a man’s [[self]]: and withal, a
man must curl his hair and set out and adjust himself, to appear in
public: now i am perpetually tricking myself out, for i am eternally upon
my own description.  custom has made all speaking of a man’s self
vicious, and positively interdicts it, in [[hatred]] to the boasting that
seems inseparable from the testimony [[men]] give of themselves:

                    “in vitium ducit culpae fuga.”

     [“the avoiding a mere [[fault]] often leads us into a greater.”
      or: “the escape from a [[fault]] leads into a vice”
      --horace, de arte poetics, verse 31.]

instead of blowing the child’s nose, this is to take his nose off
altogether.  i [[think]] the remedy worse than the disease.  but, allowing it
to be true that it must of necessity be presumption to entertain people
with discourses of one’s [[self]], i ought not, pursuing my general design,
to forbear an action that publishes this infirmity of mine, nor conceal
the [[fault]] which i not only practise but profess.  notwithstanding, to
speak my [[thought]] freely, i [[think]] that the custom of condemning wine,
because some [[people]] will be drunk, is itself to be condemned; a man
cannot [[abuse]] anything but what is [[good]] in itself; and i [[believe]] that this
rule has only regard to the popular [[vice]].  they are bits for calves, with
which neither the saints whom we hear speak so highly of themselves, nor
the [[philosophers]], nor the divines will be curbed; neither will i, who am
as little the one as the other, if they do not write of it expressly, at
all events, when the occasions [[occasion]] arise, they don’t hesitate to put
themselves on the [[public]] highway.  of what does [[socrates]] treat more
largely than of himself?  to what does he more direct and address the
discourses of his disciples, than to speak of themselves, not of the
lesson in their [[book]], but of the essence and motion of their souls [[soul]]?  we
confess ourselves religiously to [[god]] and our confessor; as our
neighbours, do to all the [[people]].  but some will [[answer]] that we there
speak nothing but accusation against ourselves; why then, we say all; for
our very [[virtue]] itself is faulty and penetrable.  my [[trade]] and art [[arts]] is to
live; he that forbids me to speak according to my own sense, [[experience]],
and practice, may as well enjoin an architect not to speak of building
according to his own [[knowledge]], but according to that of his neighbour;
according to the [[knowledge]] of another, and not according to his own.  if
it be vainglory for a [[man]] to publish his own virtues [[virtue]], why does not cicero
prefer the eloquence of hortensius, and hortensius that of cicero?
peradventure they mean that i should give testimony of myself by works
and effects, not barely by words.  i chiefly paint my thoughts [[thought]], a subject
void of form and incapable of operative production; ‘tis all that i can
do to couch it in this airy [[body]] of the voice; the wisest and devoutest
men have lived in the [[greatest]] [[care]] to avoid all apparent effects.
effects would more speak of [[fortune]] than of me; they manifest their own
office and not mine, but uncertainly and by conjecture; patterns of some
one particular [[virtue]].  i expose myself entire; ‘tis a [[body]] where, at one
view, the veins, muscles, and tendons are apparent, every of them in its
proper place; here the effects of a cold; there of the [[heart]] beating,
very dubiously.  i do not write my own acts, but myself and my essence.

i am of [[opinion]] that a [[man]] must be very cautious how he values himself,
and equally conscientious to give a true report, be it [[better]] or worse,
impartially.  if i [[thought]] myself perfectly [[good]] and [[wise]], i would rattle
it out to some [[purpose]].  to speak less of one’s [[self]] than what one really
is is folly, not modesty; and to take that for current [[pay]] which is under
a man’s value is pusillanimity and cowardice, according to, [[aristotle]].
no [[virtue]] assists itself with falsehood; [[truth]] is never matter of error.
to speak more of one’s [[self]] than is really true is not always mere
presumption; ‘tis, moreover, very often folly; to, be immeasurably
pleased with what one is, and to fall into an indiscreet self-love, is in
my [[opinion]] the substance of this [[vice]].  the most [[sovereign]] remedy to cure
it, is to do quite contrary to what these [[people]] direct who, in
forbidding [[men]] to speak of themselves, consequently, at the same [[time]],
interdict thinking of themselves too.  [[pride]] dwells in the [[thought]]; the
tongue can have but a very little share in it.

they fancy that to [[think]] of one’s [[self]] is to be delighted with one’s
self; to frequent and converse with one’s [[self]], to be overindulgent; but
this excess springs only in those who take but a superficial view of
themselves, and dedicate their main inspection to their affairs; who call
it mere reverie and idleness to occupy one’s [[self]] with one’s [[self]], and
the building one’s [[self]] up a mere building of castles in the air; who
look upon themselves as a third [[person]] only, a stranger.  if any one be
in rapture with his own [[knowledge]], looking only on those below him, let
him but turn his eye upward towards [[past]] ages [[age]], and his [[pride]] will be
abated, when he shall there find so many thousand wits that trample him
under foot.  if he enter into a flattering presumption of his personal
valour, let him but recollect the lives [[life]] of scipio, epaminondas; so many
armies, so many nations, that leave him so far behind them.  no
particular quality can make any [[man]] proud, that will at the same [[time]] put
the many other [[weak]] and imperfect ones he has in the other scale, and the
nothingness of [[human]] condition to make up the weight.  because socrates
had alone digested to [[purpose]] the precept of his [[god]], “to [[know]] himself,”
 and by that study arrived at the [[perfection]] of setting himself at nought,
he only was reputed worthy the title of a sage.  whosoever shall so know
himself, let him boldly speak it out.

chapter vii

of recompenses of honour

they who write the [[life]] of augustus caesar,--[suetonius, [[life]] of
augustus, c.  25.]--observe this in his [[military]] discipline, that he was
wonderfully liberal of gifts to [[men]] of [[merit]], but that as to the true
recompenses of [[honour]] he was as sparing; yet he himself had been
gratified by his uncle with all the [[military]] recompenses before he had
ever been in the field.  it was a pretty invention, and received into
most governments [[government]] of the [[world]], to institute [[certain]] [[vain]] and in
themselves valueless distinctions to [[honour]] and recompense [[virtue]], such
as the crowns [[crown]] of laurel, oak, and myrtle, the particular [[fashion]] of some
garment, the [[privilege]] to ride in a coach in the [[city]], or at night with a
torch, some peculiar place assigned in [[public]] assemblies, the prerogative
of [[certain]] additional names and titles, [[certain]] distinctions in the
bearing of coats of arms, and the like, the use of which, according to
the several humours [[humour]] of nations, has been variously received, and yet
continues.

we in [[france]], as also several of our neighbours, have orders of
knighthood that are instituted only for this end.  and ‘tis, in earnest,
a very [[good]] and profitable custom to find out an acknowledgment for the
worth of rare and excellent [[men]], and to satisfy them with rewards [[reward]] that
are not at all chargeable either to [[prince]] or [[people]].  and that which has
always been found by ancient [[experience]], and which we have heretofore
observed among ourselves, that [[men]] of quality have ever been more jealous
of such recompenses than of those wherein there was gain and [[profit]], is
not without very [[good]] ground and [[reason]].  if with the [[reward]], which ought
to be simply a recompense of [[honour]], they should mix other commodities
and add riches [[rich]], this mixture, instead of procuring an increase of
estimation, would debase and abate it.  the order of st. michael, which
has been so long in repute amongst us, had no greater commodity than that
it had no communication with any other commodity, which produced this
effect, that formerly there was no office or title whatever to which the
gentry pretended with so [[great]] [[desire]] and affection as they did to that;
no quality that carried with it more [[respect]] and grandeur, valour and
worth more willingly embracing and with greater [[ambition]] aspiring to a
recompense purely its own, and rather glorious than profitable.  for, in
truth, other gifts have not so [[great]] a [[dignity]] of usage, by [[reason]] they
are laid out upon all sorts of occasions [[occasion]]; with [[money]] a [[man]] pays [[pay]] the wages
of a servant, the diligence of a courier, dancing, vaulting, speaking,
and the meanest offices we receive; nay, and [[reward]] [[vice]] with it too, as
flattery, treachery, and pimping; and therefore ‘tis no wonder if virtue
less desires [[desire]] and less willingly receives this [[common]] sort of payment,
than that which is proper and peculiar to her, throughout generous and
noble.  augustus had [[reason]] to be more sparing of this than the other,
insomuch that [[honour]] is a [[privilege]] which derives its principal essence
from rarity; and so [[virtue]] itself:

          “cui malus est nemo, quis bonus esse potest?”

     [“to whom no one is ill who can be [[good]]?”-martial, xii. 82.]

we do not intend it for a commendation when we say that such a one is
careful in the [[education]] of his [[children]], by [[reason]] it is a [[common]] act,
how just and well done soever; no more than we commend a [[great]] tree,
where the whole forest is the same.  i do not [[think]] that any citizen of
sparta glorified himself much upon his valour, it being the universal
virtue of the whole nation; and as little upon his fidelity and contempt
of riches [[rich]].  there is no recompense becomes [[virtue]], how [[great]] soever, that
is once passed into a custom; and i [[know]] not withal whether we can ever
call it [[great]], being [[common]].

seeing, then, that these remunerations of [[honour]] have no other value and
estimation but only this, that few [[people]] enjoy them, ‘tis but to be
liberal of them to bring them down to nothing.  and though there should
be now more [[men]] found than in former times [[time]] worthy of our order, the
estimation of it nevertheless should not be abated, nor the [[honour]] made
cheap; and it may easily happen that more may [[merit]] it; for there is no
virtue that so easily spreads as that of [[military]] valour.  there is
another [[virtue]], true, [[perfect]], and philosophical, of which i do not
speak, and only make use of the word in our [[common]] acceptation, much
greater than this and more full, which is a [[force]] and assurance of the
soul, equally despising all sorts of adverse accidents, equable, uniform,
and constant, of which ours is no more than one little ray.  use,
education, [[example]], and custom can do all in all to the establishment of
that whereof i am speaking, and with [[great]] facility render it [[common]], as
by the [[experience]] of our civil wars [[war]] is manifest enough; and whoever could
at this [[time]] unite us all, catholic and huguenot, into one [[body]], and set
us upon some brave [[common]] enterprise, we should again make our ancient
military [[reputation]] flourish.  it is most [[certain]] that in times [[time]] [[past]] the
recompense of this order had not only a regard to valour, but had a
further prospect; it never was the [[reward]] of a valiant soldier but of a
great captain; the [[science]] of obeying was not reputed worthy of so
honourable a guerdon.  there was therein a more universal military
expertness required, and that comprehended the most and the greatest
qualities of a [[military]] [[man]]:

          “neque enim eaedem militares et imperatorix artes sunt,”

     [“for the [[arts]] of soldiery and generalship are not the same.”
      --livy, xxv. 19.]

as also, besides, a condition suitable to such a [[dignity]].  but, i say,
though more [[men]] were worthy than formerly, yet ought it not to be more
liberally distributed, and it were [[better]] to fall short in not giving it
at all to whom it should be due, than for ever to lose, as we have lately
done, the fruit of so profitable an invention.  no [[man]] of spirit will
deign to advantage himself with what is in [[common]] with many; and such of
the [[present]] [[time]] as have least merited this recompense themselves make
the greater show of disdaining it, in order thereby to be ranked with
those to whom so much [[wrong]] has been done by the unworthy conferring and
debasing the distinction which was their particular [[right]].

now, to expect that in obliterating and abolishing this, suddenly to
create and bring into credit a like institution, is not a proper attempt
for so licentious and so sick a [[time]] as this wherein we now are; and it
will fall out that the [[last]] will from its birth incur the same
inconveniences that have ruined the other.--[montaigne refers to the
order of the saint-esprit, instituted by henry iii.  in 1578.]--the
rules for dispensing this new order had need to be extremely clipt and
bound under [[great]] restrictions, to give it [[authority]]; and this tumultuous
season is incapable of such a curb: besides that, before this can be
brought into repute, ‘tis necessary that the memory of the first, and of
the contempt into which it is fallen, be buried in oblivion.

this place might naturally enough admit of some discourse upon the
consideration of valour, and the difference of this [[virtue]] from others;
but, plutarch having so often handled this [[subject]], i should give myself
an unnecessary trouble to repeat what he has said.  but this is worth
considering: that our nation places valour, vaillance, in the highest
degree of [[virtue]], as its very word evidences, being derived from valeur,
and that, according to our use, when we say a [[man]] of high worth a good
man, in our court style--‘tis to say a valiant [[man]], after the roman way;
for the general appellation of [[virtue]] with them takes etymology from vis,
force.  the proper, sole, and essential profession of, the french
noblesse is that of arms: and ‘tis likely that the first [[virtue]] that
discovered itself amongst [[men]] and has given to some advantage over
others, was that by which the strongest and most valiant have mastered
the weaker, and acquired a particular [[authority]] and [[reputation]], whence
came to it that dignified appellation; or else, that these nations, being
very warlike, gave the pre-eminence to that of the virtues [[virtue]] which was most
familiar to them; just as our passion and the feverish solicitude we have
of the chastity of [[women]] occasions [[occasion]] that to say, a [[good]] woman, a woman of
worth, a woman of [[honour]] and [[virtue]], signifies merely a chaste woman as
if, to oblige them to that one [[duty]], we were indifferent as to all the
rest, and gave them the reins in all other faults [[fault]] whatever to compound
for that one of incontinence.




chapter viii

of the affection of fathers [[father]] to their children

to madame d’estissac.

madam, if the strangeness and novelty of my [[subject]], which are wont to
give value to things, do not save me, i shall never come off with honour
from this foolish attempt: but ‘tis so fantastic, and carries a face so
unlike the [[common]] use, that this, peradventure, may make it pass.  ‘tis a
melancholic [[humour]], and consequently a [[humour]] very much an [[enemy]] to my
natural [[complexion]], engendered by the pensiveness of the solitude into
which for some years [[past]] i have retired myself, that first put into
my head this idle fancy of writing.  wherein, finding myself totally
unprovided and empty of other matter, i presented myself to myself for
argument and [[subject]].  ‘tis the only [[book]] in the [[world]] of its [[kind]], and
of a wild and extravagant design.  there is nothing worth remark in this
affair but that extravagancy: for in a [[subject]] so [[vain]] and frivolous, the
best workman in the [[world]] could not have given it a form fit to recommend
it to any manner of esteem.

now, madam, having to draw my own picture to the [[life]], i had omitted one
important feature, had i not therein represented the [[honour]] i have ever
had for you and your merits [[merit]]; which i have purposely chosen to say in the
beginning of this [[chapter]], by [[reason]] that amongst the many other
excellent qualities you are mistress of, that of the tender [[love]] you have
manifested to your [[children]], is seated in one of the highest places.
whoever knows [[know]] at what [[age]] monsieur d’estissac, your husband, left you a
widow, the [[great]] and honourable matches that have since been offered to
you, as many as to any [[lady]] of your condition in [[france]], the constancy
and steadiness wherewith, for so many years, you have sustained so many
sharp difficulties, the burden and conduct of affairs, which have
persecuted you in every corner of the [[kingdom]], and are not yet weary of
tormenting you, and the [[happy]] direction you have given to all these, by
your sole prudence or [[good]] [[fortune]], will easily conclude with me that we
have not so vivid an [[example]] as yours of maternal affection in our times [[time]].
i [[praise]] [[god]], madam, that it has been so well employed; for the great
hopes monsieur d’estissac, your [[son]], gives of himself, render sufficient
assurance that when he comes of [[age]] you will reap from him all the
obedience and gratitude of a very [[good]] [[man]].  but, forasmuch as by reason
of his tender years, he has not been capable of taking notice of those
offices of extremest value he has in so [[great]] number received from you,
i will, if these papers shall one day happen to fall into his hands, when
i shall neither have mouth nor [[speech]] left to deliver it to him, that he
shall receive from me a true account of those things, which shall be more
effectually manifested to him by their own effects, by which he will
understand that there is not a gentleman in [[france]] who stands more
indebted to a mother’s [[care]]; and that he cannot, in the future, give a
better nor more [[certain]] testimony of his own worth and [[virtue]] than by
acknowledging you for that excellent [[mother]] you are.

if there be any [[law]] truly [[natural]], that is to say, any instinct that is
seen universally and perpetually imprinted in both beasts and [[men]] (which
is not without controversy), i can say, that in my [[opinion]], next to the
care every animal has of its own preservation, and to avoid that which
may hurt him, the affection that the begetter bears to his offspring
holds the second place in this rank.  and seeing that [[nature]] appears to
have recommended it to us, having regard to the extension and progression
of the successive pieces of this machine of hers, ‘tis no wonder if, on
the contrary, that of [[children]] towards their parents is not so [[great]].
to which we may add this other aristotelian consideration, that he who
confers a benefit on any one, loves [[love]] him [[better]] than he is beloved by him
again: that he to whom is owing, loves [[love]] [[better]] than he who owes; and that
every artificer is fonder of his [[work]], than, if that [[work]] had sense, it
would be of him; by [[reason]] that it is dear to us to be, and to be
consists in movement and action; therefore every one has in some sort a
being in his [[work]].  he who confers a benefit exercises a fine and honest
action; he who receives it exercises the useful only.  now the useful is
much less lovable than the honest; the honest is stable and permanent,
supplying him who has done it with a continual gratification.  the useful
loses itself, easily slides away, and the memory of it is neither so
fresh nor so pleasing.  those things are dearest to us that have cost us
most, and giving is more chargeable than receiving.

since it has pleased [[god]] to endue us with some capacity of [[reason]], to the
end we may not, like brutes, be servilely [[subject]] and enslaved to the
laws [[common]] to both, but that we should by [[judgment]] and a voluntary
liberty apply ourselves to them, we ought, indeed, something to yield to
the simple [[authority]] of [[nature]], but not suffer ourselves to be
tyrannically hurried away and transported by her; [[reason]] alone should
have the conduct of our inclinations.  i, for my part, have a strange
disgust for those propensions that are started in us without the
mediation and direction of the [[judgment]], as, upon the [[subject]] i am
speaking of, i cannot entertain that passion of dandling and caressing
infants scarcely born, having as yet neither motion of [[soul]] nor shape of
body distinguishable, by which they can render themselves amiable, and
have not willingly [[suffered]] them to be nursed near me.  a true and
regular affection ought to spring and increase with the [[knowledge]] they
give us of themselves, and then, if they are worthy of it, the natural
propension walking hand in hand with [[reason]], to cherish them with a truly
paternal [[love]]; and so to [[judge]], also, if they be otherwise, still
rendering ourselves to [[reason]], notwithstanding the inclination of [[nature]].
‘tis oft-times quite otherwise; and, most commonly, we find ourselves
more taken with the running up and down, the games, and puerile
simplicities of our [[children]], than we do, afterwards, with their most
complete actions; as if we had loved them for our [[sport]], like monkeys,
and not as [[men]]; and some there are, who are very liberal in buying them
balls to play withal, who are very close-handed for the least necessary
expense when they come to [[age]].  nay, it looks as if the [[jealousy]] of
seeing them appear in and enjoy the [[world]] when we are about to leave it,
rendered us more niggardly and stingy towards them; it vexes us that they
tread upon our heels, as if to solicit us to go out; if this were to be
feared, since the order of things will have it so that they cannot, to
speak the [[truth]], be nor [[live]], but at the expense of our being and [[life]],
we should never meddle with being fathers [[father]] at all.

for my part, i [[think]] it [[cruelty]] and [[injustice]] not to receive them into
the share and [[society]] of our goods [[good]], and not to make them partakers in the
intelligence of our domestic affairs when they are capable, and not to
lessen and contract our own expenses to make the more room for theirs,
seeing we beget them to that effect.  ‘tis [[unjust]] that an old fellow,
broken and half [[dead]], should alone, in a corner of the chimney, enjoy the
money that would suffice for the maintenance and advancement of many
children, and suffer them, in the meantime, to lose their’ [[best]] years for
want of means to advance themselves in the [[public]] service and the
knowledge of [[men]].  a [[man]] by this course drives them to despair, and to
seek out by any means, how [[unjust]] or dishonourable soever, to provide for
their own support: as i have, in my [[time]], seen several [[young]] [[men]] of good
extraction so addicted to stealing, that no correction could cure them of
it.  i [[know]] one of a very [[good]] [[family]], to whom, at the request of a
brother of his, a very honest and brave gentleman, i once spoke on this
account, who made [[answer]], and confessed to me roundly, that he had been
put upon this paltry practice by the severity and avarice of his [[father]];
but that he was now so accustomed to it he could not leave it off.  and,
at that very [[time]], he was trapped stealing a lady’s rings, having come
into her chamber, as she was dressing with several others.  he put me in
mind of a story i had heard of another gentleman, so [[perfect]] and
accomplished in this fine [[trade]] in his [[youth]], that, after he came to his
estate and resolved to give it over, he could not hold his hands,
nevertheless, if he passed by a shop where he saw anything he liked, from
catching it up, though it put him to the shame of sending afterwards to
pay for it.  and i have myself seen several so habituated to this quality
that even amongst their comrades they could not forbear filching, though
with intent to restore what they had taken.  i am a gascon, and yet there
is no [[vice]] i so little [[understand]] as that; i hate it something more by
disposition than i condemn it by [[reason]]; i do not so much as desire
anything of another man’s.  this province of ours is, in plain [[truth]], a
little more decried than the other parts of the [[kingdom]]; and yet we have
several times [[time]] seen, in our times [[time]], [[men]] of [[good]] families [[family]] of other
provinces, in the hands of [[justice]], convicted of abominable thefts.  i
fear this [[vice]] is, in some sort, to be attributed to the fore-mentioned
vice of the fathers [[father]].

and if a [[man]] should tell me, as a [[lord]] of very [[good]] understanding once
did, that “he hoarded up [[wealth]], not to extract any other fruit and use
from his parsimony, but to make himself honoured and sought after by his
relations; and that [[age]] having deprived him of all other [[power]], it was
the only remaining remedy to maintain his [[authority]] in his [[family]], and to
keep him from being neglected and despised by all around,” in [[truth]], not
only old [[age]], but all other imbecility, according to [[aristotle]], is the
promoter of avarice; that is something, but it is physic for a disease
that a [[man]] should prevent the birth of.  a [[father]] is very miserable who
has no other hold on his children’s affection than the need they have of
his assistance, if that can be called affection; he must render himself
worthy to be respected by his [[virtue]] and [[wisdom]], and beloved by his
kindness and the sweetness of his manners; even the very ashes of a rich
matter have their value; and we are wont to have the bones and relics of
worthy [[men]] in regard and reverence.  no old [[age]] can be so decrepid in a
man who has passed his [[life]] in [[honour]], but it must be venerable,
especially to his [[children]], whose [[soul]] he must have trained up to their
duty by [[reason]], not by necessity and the need they have of him, nor by
harshness and compulsion:

         “et errat longe mea quidem sententia
          qui imperium credat esse gravius, aut stabilius,
          vi quod fit, quam illud, quod amicitia adjungitur.”

     [“he wanders far from the [[truth]], in my [[opinion]], who thinks [[think]] that
     [[government]] more absolute and durable which is acquired by [[force]] than
     that which is attached to [[friendship]].”--terence, adelph., i. i, 40.]

i condemn all [[violence]] in the [[education]] of a tender [[soul]] that is designed
for [[honour]] and [[liberty]].  there is i [[know]] not what of servile in rigour
and constraint; and i am of [[opinion]] that what is not to be done by
reason, prudence, and address, is never to be affected by [[force]].  i
myself was brought up after that manner; and they tell me that in all my
first [[age]] i never [[felt]] the rod but twice, and then very slightly.  i
practised the same method with my [[children]], who all of them died at
nurse, except leonora, my only [[daughter]], and who arrived to the [[age]] of
five years and upward without other correction for her childish faults
(her mother’s indulgence easily concurring) than words only, and those
very gentle; in which [[kind]] of proceeding, though my end and expectation
should be both frustrated, there are other causes enough to lay the fault
on without blaming my discipline, which i [[know]] to be [[natural]] and just,
and i should, in this, have yet been more [[religious]] towards the males, as
less born to subjection and more [[free]]; and i should have made it my
business to fill their hearts [[heart]] with ingenuousness and [[freedom]].  i have
never observed other effects of whipping than to render boys more
cowardly, or more wilfully obstinate.

do we [[desire]] to be beloved of our [[children]]?  will we remove from them all
occasion of wishing our [[death]] though no [[occasion]] of so horrid a [[wish]] can
either be just or excusable?

                    “nullum scelus rationem habet.”

               [“no wickedness has [[reason]].”--livy, xxviii. 28]

let us reasonably accommodate their lives [[life]] with what is in our [[power]].  in
order to this, we should not [[marry]] so [[young]] that our [[age]] shall in a
manner be confounded with theirs; for this inconvenience plunges us into
many very [[great]] difficulties, and especially the gentry of the nation,
who are of a condition wherein they have little to do, and who [[live]] upon
their rents only: for elsewhere, with [[people]] who [[live]] by their [[labour]],
the plurality and company of [[children]] is an increase to the [[common]] stock;
they are so many new tools and instruments wherewith to grow [[rich]].

i [[married]] at three-and-thirty years of [[age]], and concur in the [[opinion]] of
thirty-five, which is said to be that of [[aristotle]].   [[plato]] will have
nobody [[marry]] before thirty; but he has [[reason]] to laugh at those who
undertook the [[work]] of [[marriage]] after five-and-fifty, and condemns their
offspring as unworthy of aliment and [[life]].  thales gave the truest
limits, who, [[young]] and being importuned by his [[mother]] to [[marry]], answered,
“that it was too soon,” and, being grown into years and urged again,
“that it was too late.”  a [[man]] must deny opportunity to every inopportune
action.  the ancient gauls’ looked upon it as a very horrid thing for a
man to have [[society]] with a woman before he was twenty years of [[age]], and
strictly recommended to the [[men]] who designed themselves for [[war]] the
keeping their virginity till well grown in years, forasmuch as [[courage]] is
abated and diverted by intercourse with [[women]]:

              “ma, or congiunto a giovinetta sposa,
               e lieto omai de’ figli, era invilito
               negli affetti di padre et di marito.”

     [“now, [[married]] to a [[young]] [[wife]] and [[happy]] in [[children]], he was
     demoralised by his [[love]] as [[father]] and husband.”
      --tasso, gierus., x. 39.]

muley hassam, [[king]] of tunis, he whom the [[emperor]] charles v. restored to
his [[kingdom]], reproached the memory of his [[father]] mahomet with the
frequentation of [[women]], styling him loose, effeminate, and a getter of
children.--[of whom he had thirty-four.]--the [[greek]] [[history]] observes of
iccus the tarentine, of chryso, astyllus, diopompos, and others, that to
keep their bodies [[body]] in order for the olympic games and such like exercises,
they denied themselves during that preparation all commerce with [[venus]].
in a [[certain]] [[country]] of the spanish indies [[men]] were not permitted to
marry till after forty [[age]], and yet the girls were allowed at ten.
‘tis not [[time]] for a gentleman of thirty years old to give place to his
son who is twenty; he is himself in a condition to serve both in the
expeditions of [[war]] and in the court of his [[prince]]; has need of all his
appurtenances; and yet, doubtless, he ought to [[surrender]] a share, but not
so [[great]] an one as to forget himself for others; and for such an one the
answer that fathers [[father]] have ordinarily in their mouths, “i will not put off
my clothes, before i go to bed,” serves well.

but a [[father]] worn out with [[age]] and infirmities, and deprived by weakness
and want of health of the [[common]] [[society]] of [[men]], wrongs [[wrong]] himself and his
to amass a [[great]] heap of treasure.  he has lived long enough, if he be
wise, to have a [[mind]] to strip himself to go to bed, not to his very
shirt, i confess, but to that and a [[good]], warm dressing-gown; the
remaining pomps, of which he has no further use, he ought voluntarily to
surrender to those, to whom by the order of [[nature]] they belong.  ‘tis
reason he should refer the use of those things to them, seeing that
nature has reduced him to such a [[state]] that he cannot enjoy them himself;
otherwise there is doubtless malice and envy in the case.  the greatest
act of the [[emperor]] charles v. was that when, in imitation of some of the
ancients of his own quality, confessing it but [[reason]] to strip ourselves
when our clothes encumber and grow too heavy for us, and to [[lie]] down when
our legs begin to fail us, he resigned his possessions, grandeur, and
power to his [[son]], when he found himself failing in vigour, and steadiness
for the conduct of his affairs suitable with the [[glory]] he had therein
acquired:

          “solve senescentem mature sanus equum, ne
          peccet ad extremum ridendus, et ilia ducat.”

     [“dismiss the old horse in [[good]] [[time]], lest, failing in the lists,
     the spectators laugh.”--horace, epist., i., i, 8.]

this [[fault]] of not perceiving betimes and of not being sensible of the
feebleness and extreme alteration that [[age]] naturally brings both upon
body and [[mind]], which, in my [[opinion]], is [[equal]], if indeed the [[soul]] has not
more than half, has lost the [[reputation]] of most of the [[great]] [[men]] in the
world.  i have known in my [[time]], and been intimately acquainted with
persons of [[great]] [[authority]], whom one might easily discern marvellously
lapsed from the sufficiency i knew they were once endued with, by the
reputation they had acquired in their former years, whom i could
heartily, for their own sakes, have wished at [[home]] at their ease,
discharged of their [[public]] or [[military]] employments, which were now grown
too heavy for their shoulders.  i have formerly been very familiar in a
gentleman’s house, a widower and very old, though healthy and cheerful
enough: this gentleman had several daughters [[daughter]] to [[marry]] and a [[son]] already
of ripe [[age]], which brought upon him many visitors, and a [[great]] expense,
neither of which well pleased him, not only out of consideration of
frugality, but yet more for having, by [[reason]] of his [[age]], entered into a
course of [[life]] far differing from ours.  i told him one day a little
boldly, as i used to do, that he would do [[better]] to give us younger folk
room, and to leave his principal house (for he had but that well placed
and furnished) to his [[son]], and himself retire to an estate he had hard
by, where nobody would trouble his repose, seeing he could not otherwise
avoid being importuned by us, the condition of his [[children]] considered.
he took my [[advice]] afterwards, and found an advantage in so doing.

i do not mean that a [[man]] should so instal them as not to reserve to
himself a [[liberty]] to retract; i, who am now arrived to the [[age]] wherein
such things are fit to be done, would resign to them the enjoyment of my
house and goods [[good]], but with a [[power]] of revocation if they should give me
cause to alter my [[mind]]; i would leave to them the use, that being no
longer convenient for me; and, of the general [[authority]] and [[power]] over
all, would reserve as much as--i [[thought]] [[good]] to myself; having always
held that it must needs be a [[great]] satisfaction to an aged [[father]] himself
to put his [[children]] into the way of governing his affairs, and to have
power during his own [[life]] to control their behaviour, supplying them with
instruction and [[advice]] from his own [[experience]], and himself to transfer
the ancient [[honour]] and order of his house into the hands of those who are
to succeed him, and by that means to satisfy himself as to the hopes [[hope]] he
may conceive of their future conduct.  and in order to this i would not
avoid their company; i would observe them near at hand, and partake,
according to the condition of my [[age]], of their feasts and jollities.
if i did not [[live]] absolutely amongst them, which i could not do without
annoying them and their [[friends]], by [[reason]] of the morosity of my [[age]] and
the restlessness of my infirmities, and without violating also the rules
and order of living i should then have set down to myself, i would, at
least, [[live]] near them in some retired part of my house, not the [[best]] in
show, but the most commodious.  nor as i saw some years ago, a dean of
st. hilary of poitiers given up to such a solitude, that at the [[time]] i
came into his chamber it had been two and twenty years that he had not
stepped one foot out of it, and yet had all his motions [[free]] and easy,
and was in [[good]] health, saving a cold that fell upon his lungs; he would,
hardly once in a week, suffer any one to come in to see him; he always
kept himself shut up in his chamber alone, except that a servant brought
him, once a day, something to [[eat]], and did then but just come in and go
out again.  his employment was to walk up and down, and [[read]] some [[book]],
for he was a bit of a scholar; but, as to the rest, obstinately bent to
die in this retirement, as he soon after did.  i would endeavour by
pleasant conversation to create in my [[children]] a warm and unfeigned
friendship and good-will towards me, which in well-descended natures [[nature]] is
not hard to do; for if they be furious brutes, of which this [[age]] of ours
produces thousands, we are then to hate and avoid them as such.

i am angry at the custom of forbidding [[children]] to call their [[father]] by
the name of [[father]], and to enjoin them another, as more full of respect
and reverence, as if [[nature]] had not sufficiently provided for our
authority.  we call almighty [[god]] [[father]], and disdain to have our children
call us so; i have reformed this error in my [[family]].--[as did henry iv.
of france]--and ‘tis also folly and [[injustice]] to deprive [[children]], when
grown up, of familiarity with their [[father]], and to carry a scornful and
austere countenance toward them, thinking by that to keep them in awe and
obedience; for it is a very idle farce that, instead of producing the
effect designed, renders fathers [[father]] distasteful, and, which is worse,
ridiculous to their own [[children]].  they have [[youth]] and vigour in
possession, and consequently the breath and favour of the [[world]]; and
therefore receive these fierce and [[tyrannical]] looks--mere scarecrows--
of a [[man]] without [[blood]], either in his [[heart]] or veins, with mockery and
contempt.  though i could make myself feared, i had yet much rather make
myself beloved: there are so many sorts of defects in old [[age]], so much
imbecility, and it is so liable to contempt, that the [[best]] acquisition a
man can make is the [[kindness]] and affection of his own [[family]]; command and
fear are no longer his [[weapons]].  such an one i have known who, having
been very imperious in his [[youth]], when he came to be old, though he might
have lived at his full ease, would ever strike, rant, swear, and curse:
the most [[violent]] householder in [[france]]: fretting himself with unnecessary
suspicion and vigilance.  and all this rumble and clutter but to make his
family [[cheat]] him the more; of his barn, his kitchen, cellar, nay, and his
very purse too, others had the [[greatest]] use and share, whilst he keeps
his keys in his pocket much more carefully than his [[eyes]].  whilst he hugs
himself with the pitiful frugality of a niggard table, everything goes to
rack and ruin in every corner of his house, in play, drink, all sorts of
profusion, making [[sport]] in their junkets with his [[vain]] anger and
fruitless parsimony.  every one is a sentinel against him, and if, by
accident, any wretched fellow that serves him is of another [[humour]], and
will not join with the rest, he is presently rendered suspected to him,
a bait that old [[age]] very easily bites at of itself.  how often has this
gentleman boasted to me in how [[great]] awe he kept his [[family]], and how
exact an [[obedience]] and reverence they paid him!  how clearly he saw into
his own affairs!

                    “ille solos nescit omnia.”

          [“he alone is ignorant of all that is passing.”
           --terence, adelph., iv.  2, 9.]

i do not [[know]] any one that can muster more parts, both [[natural]] and
acquired, proper to maintain dominion, than he; yet he is fallen from it
like a child.  for this [[reason]] it is that i have picked out him, amongst
several others that i [[know]] of the same [[humour]], for the [[greatest]] [[example]].
it were matter for a [[question]] in the schools, whether he is [[better]] thus
or otherwise.  in his presence, all submit to and bow to him, and give so
much way to his vanity that nobody ever resists him; he has his fill of
assents, of seeming [[fear]], submission, and [[respect]].  does he turn away a
servant? he packs up his bundle, and is gone; but ‘tis no further than
just out of his sight: the steps of old [[age]] are so slow, the senses so
troubled, that he will [[live]] and do his old office in the same house a
year together without being perceived.

and after a fit interval of [[time]], letters are pretended to come from a
great way off; very humble, suppliant; and full of promises of amendment,
by [[virtue]] of which he is again received into favour.  does monsieur make
any bargain, or prepare any despatch that does not please? ‘tis
suppressed, and causes afterwards forged to excuse the want of execution
in the one or [[answer]] in the other.  no letters being first brought to
him, he never sees any but those that shall seem fit for his [[knowledge]].
if by accident they fall first into his own hand, being used to trust
somebody to [[read]] them to him; he reads extempore what he thinks [[think]] fit, and
often makes such a one ask him pardon who abuses [[abuse]] and rails at him in his
letter.  in short, he sees nothing, but by an image prepared and designed
beforehand and the most satisfactory they can invent, not to rouse and
awaken his ill [[humour]] and choler.  i have seen, under various aspects,
enough of these modes of domestic [[government]], long-enduring, constant, to
the like effect.

women  are evermore addicted to cross their husbands: they lay hold with
both hands on all occasions [[occasion]] to contradict and oppose them; the first
excuse serves for a plenary justification.  i have seen one who robbed
her husband wholesale, that, as she told her confessor, she might
distribute the more liberal alms.  let who will trust to that religious
dispensation.  no management of affairs seems to them of sufficient
dignity, if proceeding from the husband’s assent; they must usurp it
either by insolence or cunning, and always injuriously, or else it has
not the grace and [[authority]] they [[desire]].  when, as in the case i am
speaking of, ‘tis against a [[poor]] old [[man]] and for the [[children]], then they
make use of this title to serve their passion with [[glory]]; and, as for a
common service, easily cabal, and combine against his [[government]] and
dominion.  if they be males grown up in full and flourishing health, they
presently [[corrupt]], either by [[force]] or favour, steward, receivers, and all
the rout.  such as have neither [[wife]] nor [[son]] do not so easily fall into
this misfortune; but withal more cruelly and unworthily.  cato the elder
in his [[time]] said: so many servants, so many enemies [[enemy]]; consider, then,
whether according to the vast difference between the purity of the [[age]] he
lived in and the [[corruption]] of this of ours, he does not seem to shew us
that [[wife]], [[son]], and servant, are so many enemies [[enemy]] to us?  ‘tis well for
old [[age]] that it is always accompanied by want of observation, ignorance,
and a proneness to being deceived. for should we see how we are used and
would not acquiesce, what would become of us?  especially in such an age
as this, where the very judges [[judge]] who are to determine our controversies are
usually partisans to the [[young]], and interested in the cause. in case the
discovery of this cheating escape me, i cannot at least fail to discern
that i am very fit to be cheated.  and can a [[man]] ever enough exalt the
value of a friend, in comparison with these civil ties?  the very image
of it which i see in beasts, so pure and uncorrupted, how religiously do
i [[respect]] it!  if others [[deceive]] me, yet do i not, at least, deceive
myself in thinking i am able to defend myself from them, or in cudgelling
my brains to make myself so.  i [[protect]] myself from such treasons in my
own bosom, not by an unquiet and tumultuous curiosity, but rather by
diversion and resolution.  when i hear talk of any one’s condition, i
never trouble myself to [[think]] of him; i presently turn my [[eyes]] upon
myself to see in what condition i am; whatever concerns another relates
to me; the accident that has befallen him gives me caution, and rouses me
to turn my defence that way.  we every day and every hour say things of
another that we might properly say of ourselves, could we but apply our
observation to our own concerns, as well as extend it to others.  and
several authors have in this manner prejudiced their own cause by running
headlong upon those they attack, and darting those shafts against their
enemies, that are more properly, and with greater advantage, to be turned
upon themselves.

the late mareschal de montluc having lost his [[son]], who died in the island
of madeira, in [[truth]] a very worthy gentleman and of [[great]] expectation,
did to me, amongst his other regrets, very much insist upon what a sorrow
and heart-breaking it was that he had never made himself familiar with
him; and by that [[humour]] of paternal gravity and grimace to have lost the
opportunity of having an insight into and of well knowing, his [[son]], as
also of letting him [[know]] the extreme affection he had for him, and the
worthy [[opinion]] he had of his [[virtue]].  “that [[poor]] boy,” said he, “never
saw in me other than a stern and disdainful countenance, and is gone in a
belief that i neither knew how to [[love]] him nor esteem him according to
his desert.  for whom did i reserve the discovery of that singular
affection i had for him in my [[soul]]?  was it not he himself, who ought to
have had all the [[pleasure]] of it, and all the obligation?  i constrained
and racked myself to put on, and maintain this [[vain]] [[disguise]], and have by
that means deprived myself of the [[pleasure]] of his conversation, and, i
doubt, in some measure, his affection, which could not but be very cold
to me, having never other from me than austerity, nor [[felt]] other than a
tyrannical manner of proceeding.”

     [madame de sevigne tells us that she never [[read]] this passage without
     tears in her [[eyes]].  “my god!” she exclaims, “how full is this book
     of [[good]] sense!”  ed.]

i find this complaint to be [[rational]] and rightly apprehended: for, as i
myself [[know]] by too [[certain]] [[experience]], there is no so sweet consolation
in the loss of [[friends]] as the [[conscience]] of having had no reserve or
secret for them, and to have had with them a [[perfect]] and entire
communication.  oh my friend,--[la boetie.] am i the [[better]] for being
sensible of this; or am i the worse?  i am, doubtless, much the [[better]].
i am consoled and honoured, in the [[sorrow]] for his [[death]].  is it not a
pious and a pleasing office of my [[life]] to be always upon my friend’s
obsequies?  can there be any joy [[equal]] to this privation?

i open myself to my [[family]], as much as i can, and very willingly let them
know the [[state]] of my [[opinion]] and [[good]] will towards them, as i do to
everybody else: i make haste to bring out and [[present]] myself to them; for
i will not have them mistaken in me, in anything.  amongst other
particular customs of our ancient gauls, this, as caesar reports,--[de
bello gall., vi.  r8.]--was one, that the sons [[son]] never presented
themselves before their fathers [[father]], nor durst ever appear in their company
in [[public]], till they began to bear arms; as if they would intimate by
this, that it was also [[time]] for their fathers [[father]] to receive them into their
familiarity and acquaintance.

i have observed yet another sort of indiscretion in fathers [[father]] of my [[time]],
that, not contented with having deprived their [[children]], during their own
long lives [[life]], of the share they naturally ought to have had in their
fortunes, they afterwards leave to their wives [[wife]] the same [[authority]] over
their estates, and [[liberty]] to dispose of them according to their own
fancy.  and i have known a [[certain]] [[lord]], one of the principal officers of
the [[crown]], who, having in reversion above fifty thousand crowns [[crown]] yearly
revenue, died necessitous and overwhelmed with debt at above fifty years
of [[age]]; his [[mother]] in her extremest decrepitude being yet in possession
of all his [[property]] by the will of his [[father]], who had, for his part,
lived till near fourscore years old.  this appears to me by no means
reasonable.  and therefore i [[think]] it of very little advantage to a [[man]],
whose affairs are well enough, to seek a [[wife]] who encumbers his estate
with a very [[great]] [[fortune]]; there is no sort of [[foreign]] debt that brings
more ruin to families [[family]] than this: my predecessors have ever been aware of
that danger and provided against it, and so have i.  but those who
dissuade us from [[rich]] wives [[wife]], for [[fear]] they should be less tractable and
kind, are out in their [[advice]] to make a [[man]] lose a real commodity for so
frivolous a conjecture.  it costs an unreasonable woman no more to pass
over one [[reason]] than another; they cherish themselves most where they are
most [[wrong]].  [[injustice]] allures them, as the [[honour]] of their virtuous
actions does the [[good]]; and the more riches [[rich]] they bring with them, they are
so much the more good-natured, as [[women]], who are handsome, are all the
more inclined and proud to be chaste.

‘tis reasonable to leave the administration of affairs to the mothers [[mother]],
till the [[children]] are old enough, according to [[law]], to manage them; but
the [[father]] has brought them, up very ill, if he cannot [[hope]] that, when
they come to maturity, they will have more [[wisdom]] and ability in the
management of affairs than his [[wife]], considering the ordinary weakness of
the [[sex]].  it were, notwithstanding, to say the [[truth]], more against nature
to make the mothers [[mother]] depend upon the discretion of their [[children]]; they
ought to be plentifully provided for, to maintain themselves according to
their quality and [[age]], by [[reason]] that necessity and indigence are much
more unbecoming and insupportable to them than to [[men]]; the [[son]] should
rather be cut short than the [[mother]].

in general, the most judicious distribution of our goods [[good]], when we come to
die, is, in my [[opinion]], to let them be distributed according to the
custom of the [[country]]; the laws [[law]] have considered the matter [[better]] than we
know how to do, and ‘tis wiser to let them fail in their appointment,
than rashly to run the hazard of miscarrying in ours.  nor are the goods
properly ours, since, by civil prescription and without us, they are all
destined to [[certain]] successors.  and although we have some [[liberty]] beyond
that, yet i [[think]] we ought not, without [[great]] and manifest cause, to take
away that from one which his [[fortune]] has allotted him, and to which the
public equity gives him title; and that it is against [[reason]] to abuse
this [[liberty]], in making it serve our own frivolous and private fancies.
my [[destiny]] has been [[kind]] to me in not presenting me with occasions [[occasion]] to
tempt me and divert my affection from the [[common]] and legitimate
institution.  i see many with whom ‘tis [[time]] lost to employ a long
exercise of [[good]] offices: a word ill taken obliterates ten years’ [[merit]];
he is [[happy]] who is in a position to [[oil]] their goodwill at this last
passage.  the [[last]] action carries it, not the [[best]] and most frequent
offices, but the most recent and [[present]] do the [[work]].  these are people
that play with their wills as with apples or rods, to gratify or chastise
every action of those who pretend to an interest in their [[care]].  ‘tis a
thing of too [[great]] weight and consequence to be so tumbled and tossed and
altered every moment, and wherein the [[wise]] determine once for all, having
above all things regard to [[reason]] and the [[public]] observance.  we lay
these masculine substitutions too much to [[heart]], proposing a ridiculous
eternity to our names.  we are, moreover, too [[superstitious]] in vain
conjectures as to the future, that we derive from the words and actions
of [[children]].  peradventure they might have done me an [[injustice]], in
dispossessing me of my [[right]], for having been the most dull and heavy,
the most slow and unwilling at my [[book]], not of all my brothers [[brother]] only, but
of all the boys in the whole province: whether about learning my lesson,
or about any bodily exercise.  ‘tis a folly to make an election out of
the ordinary course upon the credit of these divinations wherein we are
so often deceived.  if the ordinary [[rule]] of descent were to be violated,
and the destinies corrected in the [[choice]] they have made of our heirs,
one might more plausibly do it upon the account of some remarkable and
enormous personal deformity, a permanent and incorrigible defect, and in
the [[opinion]] of us french, who are [[great]] admirers of [[beauty]], an important
prejudice.

the pleasant dialogue betwixt plato’s legislator and his [[citizens]] will be
an ornament to this place, “what,” said they, feeling themselves about to
die, “may we not dispose of our own to whom we please?  god!  what
cruelty that it shall not be lawful for us, according as we have been
served and attended in our sickness, in our old [[age]], in our affairs, to
give more or less to those whom we have found most diligent about us, at
our own fancy and discretion!”  to which the legislator answers [[answer]] thus:

“my [[friends]], who are now, without [[question]], very soon to [[die]], it is hard
for you in the condition you are, either to [[know]] yourselves, or what is
yours, according to the delphic inscription.  i, who make the laws [[law]], am of
opinion, that you neither are yourselves your own, nor is that yours of
which you are possessed.  both your goods [[good]] and you belong to your
families, as well those [[past]] as those to come; but, further, both your
family and goods [[good]] much more appertain to the [[public]].  wherefore, lest any
flatterer in your old [[age]] or in your sickness, or any passion of your
own, should unseasonably prevail with you to make an [[unjust]] will, i shall
take [[care]] to prevent that inconvenience; but, having [[respect]] both to the
universal interests of the [[city]] and that of your particular [[family]], i
shall establish laws [[law]], and make it by [[good]] reasons [[reason]] appear, that private
convenience ought to give place to the [[common]] benefit.  go then
cheerfully where [[human]] necessity calls you.  it is for me, who regard no
more the one thing than the other, and who, as much as in me lies [[lie]], am
provident of the [[public]] interest, to have a [[care]] as to what you leave
behind you.”

to return to my [[subject]]: it appears to me that [[women]] are very rarely
born, to whom the prerogative over [[men]], the maternal and natural
excepted, is in any sort due, unless it be for the [[punishment]] of such,
as in some amorous fever have voluntarily submitted themselves to them:
but that in no way concerns the old ones, of whom we are now speaking.
this consideration it is which has made us so willingly to enact and give
force to that [[law]], which was never yet seen by any one, by which women
are excluded the succession to our [[crown]]: and there is hardly a
government in the [[world]] where it is not pleaded, as it is here, by the
probability of [[reason]] that authorises it, though [[fortune]] has given it
more credit in some places than in others.  ‘tis dangerous to leave the
disposal of our succession to their [[judgment]], according to the choice
they shall make of [[children]], which is often fantastic and [[unjust]]; for the
irregular appetites and depraved tastes they have during the [[time]] of
their being with child, they have at all other times [[time]] in the [[mind]].  we
commonly see them fond of the most [[weak]], ricketty, and deformed [[children]];
or of those, if they have such, as are still hanging at the breast.  for,
not having sufficient [[force]] of [[reason]] to choose and embrace that which is
most worthy, they the more willingly suffer themselves to be carried
away, where the impressions of [[nature]] are most alone; like animals that
know their [[young]] no longer than they give them suck.  as to the rest, it
is easy by [[experience]] to be discerned that this [[natural]] affection to
which we give so [[great]] [[authority]] has but very [[weak]] roots.  for a very
little [[profit]], we every day tear their own [[children]] out of the mothers’
arms, and make them take ours in their room: we make them abandon their
own to some pitiful nurse, to whom we disdain to commit ours, or to some
she-goat, forbidding them, not only to give them suck, what danger soever
they run thereby, but, moreover, to take any manner of [[care]] of them, that
they may wholly be occupied with the [[care]] of and attendance upon ours;
and we see in most of them an adulterate affection, more vehement than
the [[natural]], begotten by custom toward the foster [[children]], and a greater
solicitude for the preservation of those they have taken charge of, than
of their own.  and that which i was saying of goats was upon this
account; that it is ordinary all about where i [[live]], to see the
countrywomen, when they want milk of their own for their [[children]], to
call goats to their assistance; and i have at this hour two men-servants
that never sucked women’s milk more than eight days after they were born.
these goats are immediately taught to come to suckle the little [[children]],
know their voices when they cry, and come running to them.  if any other
than this foster-child be presented to them, they refuse to let it suck;
and the child in like manner will refuse to suck another goat.  i saw one
the other day from whom they had taken away the goat that used to nourish
it, by [[reason]] the [[father]] had only borrowed it of a neighbour; the child
would not touch any other they could bring, and died, doubtless of
hunger.  beasts as easily alter and [[corrupt]] their [[natural]] affection as
we: i [[believe]] that in what herodotus relates of a [[certain]] district of
lybia, there are many mistakes; he says that the [[women]] are there in
common; but that the child, so soon as it can go, finds him out in the
crowd for his [[father]], to whom he is first [[led]] by his [[natural]] inclination.

now, to consider this simple [[reason]] for loving our [[children]], that we have
begot them, therefore calling them our second selves, it appears,
methinks, that there is another [[kind]] of production proceeding from us,
that is of no less recommendation: for that which we engender by the
soul, the issue of our understanding, [[courage]], and abilities, springs
from nobler parts than those of the [[body]], and that are much more our own:
we are both [[father]] and [[mother]] in this [[generation]].  these cost us a great
deal more and bring us more [[honour]], if they have anything of [[good]] in
them.  for the value of our other [[children]] is much more theirs than ours;
the share we have in them is very little; but of these all the [[beauty]],
all the grace and value, are ours; and also they more vividly represent
us than the others.  [[plato]] adds, that these are [[immortal]] [[children]] that
immortalise and deify their fathers [[father]], as lycurgus, solon, minos.  now,
histories being full of examples [[example]] of the [[common]] affection of fathers [[father]] to
their [[children]], it seems not altogether improper to introduce some few of
this other [[kind]].  heliodorus, that [[good]] bishop of trikka, rather chose to
lose the [[dignity]], [[profit]], and devotion of so venerable a prelacy, than to
lose his [[daughter]]; a [[daughter]] that continues to this day very graceful
and comely; but, peradventure, a little too curiously and wantonly
tricked, and too amorous for an ecclesiastical and sacerdotal [[daughter]].
there was one labienus at [[rome]], a [[man]] of [[great]] worth and [[authority]], and
amongst other qualities excellent in all sorts of literature, who was, as
i take it, the [[son]] of that [[great]] labienus, the [[chief]] of caesar’s captains
in the wars [[war]] of gaul; and who, afterwards, siding with pompey the [[great]],
so valiantly maintained his cause, till he was by caesar defeated in
spain.  this labienus, of whom i am now speaking, had several enemies [[enemy]],
envious of his [[good]] qualities, and, tis likely, the courtiers and minions
of the emperors [[emperor]] of his [[time]] who were very angry at his [[freedom]] and the
paternal [[humour]] which he yet retained against [[tyranny]], with which it is
to be supposed he had tinctured his books [[book]] and writings.  his adversaries
prosecuted several pieces he had published before the magistrates at
rome, and prevailed so far against him, as to have them condemned to the
fire.  it was in him that this new [[example]] of [[punishment]] was begun, which
was afterwards continued against others at [[rome]], to punish even writing
and studies with [[death]].  there would not be means and matter enough of
cruelty, did we not mix with them things that [[nature]] has exempted from
all sense and suffering, as [[reputation]] and the products of the [[mind]], and
did we not communicate corporal punishments [[punishment]] to the teachings and
monuments of the muses.  now, labienus could not suffer this loss, nor
survive these his so dear issue, and therefore caused himself to be
conveyed and shut up alive in the monument of his [[ancestors]], where he
made shift to kill and bury himself at once.  ‘tis hard to shew a more
vehement paternal affection than this.  cassius severus, a [[man]] of great
eloquence and his very intimate friend, seeing his books [[book]] burned, cried
out that by the same sentence they should as well condemn him to the fire
too, seeing that he carried in his memory all that they contained.  the
like accident befel cremutius cordus, who being accused of having in his
books commended brutus and cassius, that dirty, servile, and corrupt
senate, worthy a worse master than tiberius, condemned his writings to
the flame.  he was willing to bear them company, and killed himself with
fasting.  the [[good]] lucan, being condemned by that rascal nero, at the
last gasp of his [[life]], when the greater part of his [[blood]] was already
spent through the veins of his arms, which he had caused his physician to
open to make him [[die]], and when the cold had seized upon all his
extremities, and began to approach his vital parts, the [[last]] thing he had
in his memory was some of the verses of his [[battle]] of phaysalia, which he
recited, dying with them in his mouth.  what was this, but taking a
tender and paternal leave of his [[children]], in imitation of the
valedictions and embraces, wherewith we part from ours, when we come to
die, and an effect of that [[natural]] inclination, that suggests to our
remembrance in this extremity those things which were dearest to us
during the [[time]] of our [[life]]?

can we [[believe]] that epicurus who, as he says himself, dying of the
intolerable [[pain]] of the stone, had all his consolation in the [[beauty]] of
the doctrine he left behind him, could have received the same
satisfaction from many [[children]], though never so well-conditioned and
brought up, had he had them, as he did from the production of so many
rich writings?  or that, had it been in his [[choice]] to have left behind
him a deformed and untoward child or a foolish and ridiculous [[book]], he,
or any other [[man]] of his understanding, would not rather have chosen to
have run the first misfortune than the other?  it had been, for [[example]],
peradventure, an impiety in st. augustin, if, on the one hand, it had
been proposed to him to bury his writings, from which [[religion]] has
received so [[great]] fruit, or on the other to bury his [[children]], had he had
them, had he not rather chosen to bury his [[children]].  and i [[know]] not
whether i had not much rather have begot a very beautiful one, through
society with the muses, than by lying with my [[wife]].  to this, such as it
is, what i give it i give absolutely and irrevocably, as [[men]] do to their
bodily [[children]].  that little i have done for it, is no more at my own
disposal; it may [[know]] many things that are gone from me, and from me hold
that which i have not retained; and which, as well as a stranger, i
should borrow thence, should i stand in need.  if i am wiser than my
book, it is richer than i.  there are few [[men]] addicted to poetry, who
would not be much prouder to be the [[father]] to the aeneid than to the
handsomest [[youth]] of [[rome]]; and who would not much [[better]] bear the loss of
the one than of the other.  for according to [[aristotle]], the poet, of all
artificers, is the fondest of his [[work]].  ‘tis hard to [[believe]] that
epaminondas, who boasted that in lieu of all [[posterity]] he left two
daughters behind him that would one day do their [[father]] [[honour]] (meaning
the two victories [[victory]] he obtained over the lacedaemonians), would willingly
have consented to exchange these for the most beautiful creatures of all
greece; or that alexander or caesar ever wished to be deprived of the
grandeur of their glorious exploits in [[war]], for the convenience of
children and heirs, how [[perfect]] and accomplished soever.  nay, i make a
great [[question]], whether phidias or any other excellent sculptor would be
so solicitous of the preservation and continuance of his natural
children, as he would be of a rare statue, which with long [[labour]] and
study he had perfected according to art [[arts]].  and to those furious and
irregular [[passions]] that have sometimes inflamed fathers [[father]] towards their own
daughters, and mothers [[mother]] towards their own sons [[son]], the like is also found in
this other sort of parentage: witness what is related of pygmalion who,
having made the statue of a woman of singular [[beauty]], fell so
passionately in [[love]] with this [[work]] of his, that the gods in favour of
his passion inspired it with [[life]].

              “tentatum mollescit ebur, positoque rigore,
               subsidit digitis.”

     [“the ivory grows soft under his touch and yields to his fingers.”
      --ovid, metam., x. 283.]




chapter ix

of the arms of the parthians

‘tis an ill custom and unmanly that the gentlemen of our [[time]] have got,
not to put on arms but just upon the point of the most extreme necessity,
and to lay them by again, so soon as ever there is any show of the danger
being over; hence many disorders arise; for every one bustling and
running to his arms just when he should go to charge, has his cuirass to
buckle on when his companions are already put to rout.  our ancestors
were wont to give their head-piece, lance and gauntlets to be carried,
but never put off the other pieces so long as there was any [[work]] to be
done.  our [[troops]] are now cumbered and rendered unsightly with the
clutter of baggage and servants who cannot be from their masters, by
reason they carry their arms.  titus livius speaking of our nation:

     “intolerantissima laboris corpora vix arma humeris gerebant.”

     [“bodies most impatient of [[labour]] could scarce endure to wear
     their arms on their shoulders.”--livy, x. 28.]

many nations do yet, and did anciently, go to [[war]] without defensive arms,
or with such, at least, as were of very little proof:

          “tegmina queis capitum, raptus de subere cortex.”

     [“to whom the coverings of the heads were the bark of the
     cork-tree.”--aeneid, vii. 742.]

alexander, the most adventurous captain that ever was, very seldom wore
armour, and such amongst us as slight it, do not by that much harm to the
main concern; for if we see some killed for want of it, there are few
less whom the lumber of arms helps to [[destroy]], either by being
overburthened, crushed, and cramped with their weight, by a rude shock,
or otherwise.  for, in plain [[truth]], to observe the weight and thickness
of the armour we have now in use, it seems as if we only sought to defend
ourselves, and are rather loaded than secured by it.  we have enough to
do to support its weight, being so manacled and immured, as if we were
only to contend with our own arms, and as if we had not the same
obligation to defend them, that they have to defend us.  tacitus gives a
pleasant description of the men-at-arms among our ancient gauls, who were
so armed as only to be able to stand, without [[power]] to harm or to be
harmed, or to rise again if once struck down.  lucullus, seeing certain
soldiers of the medes, who formed the van of tigranes’ [[army]], heavily
armed and very uneasy, as if in prisons of iron, thence conceived hopes
with [[great]] ease to defeat them, and by them began his charge and [[victory]].
and now that our musketeers are in credit, i [[believe]] some invention will
be found out to immure us for our safety, and to draw us to the [[war]] in
castles, such as those the ancients loaded their elephants withal.

this [[humour]] is far differing from that of the younger scipio, who sharply
reprehended his soldiers for having planted caltrops under water, in a
ditch by which those of the town he held besieged might sally out upon
him; saying, that those who assaulted should [[think]] of attacking, and not
to [[fear]]; suspecting, with [[good]] [[reason]], that this stop they had put to the
enemies, would make themselves less vigilant upon their guard.  he said
also to a [[young]] [[man]], who showed him a fine buckler he had, that he was
very proud of, “it is a very fine buckler indeed, but a roman soldier
ought to repose greater confidence in his [[right]] hand than in his left.”

now ‘tis nothing but the not being used to wear it that makes the weight
of our armour so intolerable:

         “l’usbergo in dosso haveano, et l’elmo in testa,
          due di questi guerrier, de’ quali io canto;
          ne notte o di, d’ appoi ch’ entraro in questa
          stanza, gl’haveano mai messi da canto;
          che facile a portar come la vesta
          era lor, perche in uso l’havean tanto:”

     [“two of the warriors, of whom i sing, had on their backs their
     cuirass and on their heads their casque, and never had night or day
     once laid them by, whilst here they were; those arms, by long
     practice, were grown as [[light]] to bear as a garment”
      --ariosto, cant., mi. 30.]

the [[emperor]] caracalla was wont to march on foot, completely armed, at the
head of his [[army]].  the roman infantry always carried not only a morion, a
sword, and a shield (for as to arms, says cicero, they were so accustomed
to have them always on, that they were no more trouble to them than their
own limbs):

               “arma enim membra militis esse dicunt.”

but, moreover, fifteen days’ provision, together with a [[certain]] number of
stakes, wherewith to fortify their camp, sixty pounds in weight.  and
marius’ soldiers, laden at the same rate, were inured to march in order
of [[battle]] five leagues in five hours, and sometimes, upon any urgent
occasion, six.

their [[military]] discipline was much ruder than ours, and accordingly
produced much greater effects.  the younger scipio, reforming his [[army]] in
spain, ordered his soldiers to [[eat]] standing, and nothing that was drest.
the jeer that was given a lacedaemonian soldier is marvellously pat to
this [[purpose]], who, in an expedition of [[war]], was reproached for having
been seen under the roof of a house: they were so inured to hardship
that, let the weather be what it would, it was a shame to be seen under
any other cover than the roof of [[heaven]].  we should not march our people
very far at that rate.

as to what remains, marcellinus,  a [[man]] bred up in the roman wars [[war]],
curiously observes the manner of the parthians arming themselves, and the
rather, for being so different from that of the romans.  “they had,” says
he, “armour so woven as to have all the scales fall over one another like
so many little feathers; which did nothing hinder the motion of the [[body]],
and yet were of such [[resistance]], that our darts hitting upon them, would
rebound” (these were the coats of mail our forefathers were so constantly
wont to use).  and in another place: “they had,” says he, “strong and
able horses, covered with thick tanned hides of leather, and were
themselves armed ‘cap-a-pie’ with [[great]] plates of iron, so artificially
ordered, that in all parts of the limbs, which required bending, they
lent themselves to the motion.  one would have said, that they had been
men of iron; having armour for the head so neatly fitted, and so
naturally representing the form of a face, that they were nowhere
vulnerable, save at two little round holes, that gave them a little
light, corresponding with their [[eyes]], and [[certain]] small chinks about
their nostrils, through which they, with [[great]] difficulty, breathed,”

              “flexilis inductis animatur lamina membris,
               horribilis visu; credas simulacra moveri
               ferrea, cognatoque viros spirare metallo.
               par vestitus equis: ferrata fronte minantur,
               ferratosque movent, securi vulneris, armos.”

     [“plates of steel are placed over the [[body]], so flexible that,
     dreadful to be seen, you would [[think]] these not living [[men]], but
     moving images.  the horses are similarly armed, and, secured from
     wounds, move their iron shoulders.”--claud, in ruf., ii. 358.]

‘tis a description drawing very near resembling the equipage of the
men-at-arms in [[france]], with their barded horses.  plutarch says, that
demetrius caused two complete suits of armour to be made for himself and
for alcimus, a captain of the [[greatest]] note and [[authority]] about him, of
six score pounds weight each, whereas the ordinary suits weighed but half
as much.




chapter x

of books

i make no [[doubt]] but that i often happen to speak of things that are much
better and more truly handled by those who are masters of the [[trade]].  you
have here purely an essay of my [[natural]] parts, and not of those acquired:
and whoever shall catch me tripping in ignorance, will not in any sort
get the [[better]] of me; for i should be very unwilling to become
responsible to another for my writings, who am not so to myself, nor
satisfied with them.  whoever goes in quest of [[knowledge]], let him fish
for it where it is to be found; there is nothing i so little profess.
these are fancies of my own, by which i do not pretend to discover things
but to lay open myself; they may, peradventure, one day be known to me,
or have formerly been, according as [[fortune]] has been able to bring me in
place where they have been explained; but i have utterly forgotten it;
and if i am a [[man]] of some reading, i am a [[man]] of no retention; so that i
can promise no certainty, more than to make known to what point the
knowledge i now have has risen.  therefore, let none lay stress upon the
matter i write, but upon my method in writing it.  let them observe, in
what i borrow, if i have known how to choose what is proper to raise or
help the invention, which is always my own.  for i make others say for
me, not before but after me, what, either for want of [[language]] or want of
sense, i cannot myself so well express.  i do not number my borrowings,
i weigh them; and had i designed to raise their value by number, i had
made them twice as many; they are all, or within a very few, so famed and
ancient authors, that they seem, methinks, themselves sufficiently to
tell who they are, without giving me the trouble.  in reasons [[reason]],
comparisons, and arguments, if i transplant any into my own soil, and
confound them amongst my own, i purposely conceal the author, to awe the
temerity of those precipitate censors who fall upon all sorts of
writings, particularly the late ones, of [[men]] yet living; and in the
vulgar tongue which puts every one into a capacity of criticising and
which seem to convict the conception and design as vulgar also.  i will
have them give plutarch a fillip on my nose, and rail against seneca when
they [[think]] they rail at me.  i must shelter my own weakness under these
great reputations.  i shall [[love]] any one that can unplume me, that is,
by clearness of understanding and [[judgment]], and by the sole distinction
of the [[force]] and [[beauty]] of the discourse.  for i who, for want of memory,
am at every turn at a loss to, pick them out of their national livery, am
yet [[wise]] enough to [[know]], by the measure of my own abilities, that my soil
is incapable of producing any of those [[rich]] flowers that i there find
growing; and that all the fruits of my own [[growth]] are not worth any one
of them.  for this, indeed, i hold myself responsible; if i get in my own
way; if there be any vanity and defect in my writings which i do not of
myself perceive nor can discern, when pointed out to me by another; for
many faults [[fault]] escape our eye, but the infirmity of [[judgment]] consists in not
being able to discern them, when by another laid open to us.  knowledge
and [[truth]] may be in us without [[judgment]], and [[judgment]] also without them;
but the [[confession]] of ignorance is one of the finest and surest
testimonies of [[judgment]] that i [[know]].  i have no other officer to put my
writings in rank and file, but only [[fortune]].  as things come into my
head, i heap them one upon another; sometimes they advance in whole
bodies, sometimes in [[single]] file.  i would that every one should see my
natural and ordinary pace, irregular as it is; i suffer myself to jog on
at my own rate.  neither are these subjects [[subject]] which a [[man]] is not permitted
to be ignorant in, or casually and at a venture, to discourse of.  i
could [[wish]] to have a more [[perfect]] [[knowledge]] of things, but i will not buy
it so dear as it costs.  my design is to pass over easily, and not
laboriously, the remainder of my [[life]]; there is nothing that i will
cudgel my brains about; no, not even [[knowledge]], of what value soever.

i seek, in the reading of books [[book]], only to please myself by an honest
diversion; or, if i study, ‘tis for no other [[science]] than what treats of
the [[knowledge]] of myself, and instructs me how to [[die]] and how to live
well.

               “has meus ad metas sudet oportet equus.”

               [“my horse must [[work]] according to my step.”
                --propertius, iv.]

i do not bite my nails about the difficulties i meet with in my reading;
after a charge or two, i give them over.  should i insist upon them, i
should both lose myself and [[time]]; for i have an impatient understanding,
that must be satisfied at first: what i do not discern at once is by
persistence rendered more obscure. i do nothing without gaiety;
continuation and a too obstinate endeavour, darkens, stupefies, and tires
my [[judgment]].  my sight is confounded and dissipated with poring; i must
withdraw it, and refer my discovery to new attempts; just as, to judge
rightly of the lustre of scarlet, we are taught to pass the eye lightly
over it, and again to run it over at several sudden and reiterated
glances.  if one [[book]] do not please me, i take another; and i never
meddle with any, but at such times [[time]] as i am weary of doing nothing.
i [[care]] not much for new ones, because the old seem fuller and stronger;
neither do i converse much with [[greek]] authors, because my [[judgment]] cannot
do its [[work]] with imperfect [[intelligence]] of the material.

amongst books [[book]] that are simply pleasant, of the moderns, boccaccio’s
decameron, rabelais, and the basia of johannes secundus (if those may be
ranged under the title) are worth reading for amusement.  as to the
amadis, and such [[kind]] of stuff, they had not the credit of arresting even
my [[childhood]].  and i will, moreover, say, whether boldly or rashly, that
this old, heavy [[soul]] of mine is now no longer tickled with ariosto, no,
nor with the worthy ovid; his facility and inventions, with which i was
formerly so ravished, are now of no more relish, and i can hardly have
the patience to [[read]] them.  i speak my [[opinion]] freely of all things, even
of those that, perhaps, exceed my capacity, and that i do not conceive to
be, in any [[wise]], under my jurisdiction.  and, accordingly, the [[judgment]] i
deliver, is to show the measure of my own sight, and not of the things i
make so bold to criticise.  when i find myself disgusted with plato’s
‘axiochus’, as with a [[work]], with due [[respect]] to such an author be it
spoken, without [[force]], my [[judgment]] does not [[believe]] itself: it is not so
arrogant as to oppose the [[authority]] of so many other famous judgments [[judgment]] of
antiquity, which it considers as its tutors and masters, and with whom it
is rather content to err; in such a case, it condemns itself either to
stop at the outward bark, not being able to penetrate to the [[heart]], or to
consider it by sortie false [[light]].  it is content with only securing
itself from trouble and disorder; as to its own weakness, it frankly
acknowledges and confesses it.  it thinks [[think]] it gives a just interpretation
to the appearances by its conceptions presented to it; but they are weak
and imperfect.  most of the fables of aesop have diverse senses and
meanings, of which the mythologists chose some one that quadrates well to
the fable; but, for the most part, ‘tis but the first face that presents
itself and is superficial only; there yet remain others more vivid,
essential, and profound, into which they have not been able to penetrate;
and just so ‘tis with me.

but, to pursue the [[business]] of this essay, i have always [[thought]] that, in
poesy, [[virgil]], lucretius, catullus, and horace by many degrees [[degree]] excel the
rest; and signally, [[virgil]] in his georgics, which i look upon as the most
accomplished piece in poetry; and in comparison of which a [[man]] may easily
discern that there are some places in his aeneids, to which the author
would have given a little more of the file, had he had leisure: and the
fifth [[book]] of his aeneids seems to me the most [[perfect]].  i also love
lucan, and willingly [[read]] him, not so much for his style, as for his own
worth, and the [[truth]] and solidity of his opinions [[opinion]] and judgments [[judgment]].  as for
good terence, the refined elegance and grace of the latin tongue, i find
him admirable in his vivid representation of our manners and the
movements of the [[soul]]; our actions throw me at every turn upon him; and
i cannot [[read]] him so often that i do not still discover some new grace
and [[beauty]].  such as lived near virgil’s [[time]] complained that some should
compare lucretius to him.  i am of [[opinion]] that the comparison is, in
truth, very unequal: a [[belief]] that, nevertheless, i have much ado to
assure myself in, when i come upon some excellent passage in lucretius.
but if they were so angry at this comparison, what would they say to the
brutish and barbarous stupidity of those who, nowadays, compare him with
ariosto?  would not ariosto himself say?

               “o seclum insipiens et inficetum!”

          [“o stupid and tasteless [[age]].”--catullus, xliii. 8.]

i [[think]] the ancients had more [[reason]] to be angry with those who compared
plautus with terence, though much nearer the mark, than lucretius with
virgil.  it makes much for the estimation and preference of terence, that
the [[father]] of roman eloquence has him so often, and alone of his class,
in his mouth; and the [[opinion]] that the [[best]] [[judge]] of roman poets
--[horace, de art [[arts]].  poetica, 279.]--has passed upon his companion.  i
have often observed that those of our times [[time]], who take upon them to write
comedies (in imitation of the italians, who are [[happy]] enough in that way
of writing), take three or four plots of those of plautus or terence to
make one of their own, and , crowd five or six of boccaccio’s novels into
one [[single]] comedy.  that which makes them so load themselves with matter
is the diffidence they have of being able to support themselves with
their own [[strength]].  they must find out something to lean to; and not
having of their own stuff wherewith to entertain us, they bring in the
story to supply the defect of [[language]].  it is quite otherwise with my
author; the elegance and [[perfection]] of his way of speaking makes us lose
the appetite of his plot; his refined grace and elegance of diction
everywhere occupy us: he is so pleasant throughout,

               “liquidus, puroque simillimus amni,”

               [“liquid, and likest the pure river.”
                --horace, ep., ii. s, 120.]

and so possesses the [[soul]] with his graces that we forget those of his
fable.  this same consideration carries me further:  i observe that the
best of the ancient poets have avoided affectation and the hunting after,
not only fantastic spanish and petrarchic elevations, but even the softer
and more gentle touches, which are the ornament of all succeeding poesy.
and yet there is no [[good]] [[judgment]] that will condemn this in the ancients,
and that does not incomparably more [[admire]] the [[equal]] polish, and that
perpetual sweetness and flourishing [[beauty]] of catullus’s epigrams, than
all the stings with which martial arms the tails of his.  this is by the
same [[reason]] that i gave before, and as martial says of himself:

               “minus illi ingenio laborandum fuit,
               in cujus locum materia successerat:”

     [“he had the less for his wit to do that the [[subject]] itself
     supplied what was necessary.”--martial, praef.  ad lib. viii.]

the first, without being moved, or without getting angry, make themselves
sufficiently [[felt]]; they have matter enough of laughter throughout, they
need not tickle themselves; the others have need of [[foreign]] assistance;
as they have the less wit they must have the more [[body]]; they mount on
horseback, because they are not able to stand on their own legs.  as in
our balls, those mean fellows who [[teach]] to dance, not being able to
represent the presence and [[dignity]] of our noblesse, are fain to put
themselves forward with dangerous jumping, and other [[strange]] motions and
tumblers tricks; and the ladies [[lady]] are less put to it in dance; where there
are various coupees, changes [[change]], and quick motions of [[body]], than in some
other of a more sedate [[kind]], where they are only to move a [[natural]] pace,
and to represent their ordinary grace and presence.  and so i have seen
good drolls, when in their own everyday clothes, and with the same face
they always wear, give us all the [[pleasure]] of their art [[arts]], when their
apprentices, not yet arrived at such a pitch of [[perfection]], are fain to
meal their faces, put themselves into ridiculous disguises, and make a
hundred grotesque faces to give us whereat to laugh.  this conception of
mine is nowhere more demonstrable than in comparing the aeneid with
orlando furioso; of which we see the first, by dint of wing, flying in a
brave and lofty place, and always following his point: the latter,
fluttering and hopping from tale to tale, as from branch to branch, not
daring to trust his wings but in very short flights, and perching at
every turn, lest his breath and [[strength]] should fail.

                    “excursusque breves tentat.”

               [“and he attempts short excursions.”
                --virgil, georgics, iv.  194.]

these, then, as to this sort of subjects [[subject]], are the authors that best
please me.

as to what concerns my other reading, that mixes a little more profit
with the [[pleasure]], and whence i learn how to marshal my opinions [[opinion]] and
conditions, the books [[book]] that serve me to this [[purpose]] are plutarch, since
he has been translated into french, and seneca.  both of these have this
notable convenience suited to my [[humour]], that the [[knowledge]] i there seek
is discoursed in loose pieces, that do not require from me any trouble of
reading long, of which i am incapable.  such are the minor works [[work]] of the
first and the epistles of the latter, which are the [[best]] and most
profiting of all their writings.  ‘tis no [[great]] attempt to take one of
them in hand, and i give over at [[pleasure]]; for they have no sequence or
dependence upon one another.  these authors, for the most part, concur in
useful and true opinions [[opinion]]; and there is this parallel betwixt them, that
fortune brought them into the [[world]] about the same century: they were
both tutors to two roman emperors [[emperor]]: both sought out from foreign
countries: both [[rich]] and both [[great]] [[men]].  their instruction is the cream
of [[philosophy]], and delivered after a plain and pertinent manner.
plutarch is more uniform and constant; seneca more various and waving:
the [[last]] toiled and bent his whole [[strength]] to fortify [[virtue]] against
weakness, [[fear]], and vicious appetites; the other seems more to slight
their [[power]], and to disdain to alter his pace and to stand upon his
guard.  plutarch’s opinions [[opinion]] are platonic, gentle, and accommodated to
civil [[society]]; those of the other are stoical and epicurean, more remote
from the [[common]] use, but, in my [[opinion]], more individually commodious and
more firm.  seneca seems to lean a little to the [[tyranny]] of the emperors
of his [[time]], and only seems; for i take it for [[certain]] that he speaks
against his [[judgment]] when he condemns the action of the generous
murderers of caesar.  plutarch is frank throughout: seneca abounds with
brisk touches and sallies; plutarch with things that warm and move you
more; this contents and pays [[pay]] you [[better]]: he guides us, the other pushes
us on.

as to cicero, his works [[work]] that are most useful to my design are they that
treat of manners and rules [[rule]] of our [[life]].  but boldly to confess the truth
(for since one has passed the barriers of impudence, there is no bridle),
his way of writing appears to me negligent and uninviting: for his
prefaces, definitions, divisions, and etymologies take up the greatest
part of his [[work]]: whatever there is of [[life]] and marrow is smothered and
lost in the long preparation.  when i have spent an hour in reading him,
which is a [[great]] deal for me, and try to recollect what i have thence
extracted of juice and substance, for the most part i find nothing but
wind; for he is not yet come to the arguments that serve to his [[purpose]],
and to the reasons [[reason]] that properly [[help]] to form the knot i seek.  for me,
who only [[desire]] to become more [[wise]], not more learned or eloquent, these
logical and aristotelian dispositions of parts are of no use.  i would
have a [[man]] begin with the main proposition.  i [[know]] well enough what
death and [[pleasure]] are; let no [[man]] give himself the trouble to anatomise
them to me.  i look for [[good]] and solid reasons [[reason]], at the first dash, to
instruct me how to stand their shock, for which [[purpose]] neither
grammatical subtleties nor the quaint contexture of words and
argumentations are of any use at all.  i am for discourses that give the
first charge into the [[heart]] of the redoubt; his languish about the
subject; they are proper for the schools, for the bar, and for the
pulpit, where we have leisure to nod, and may awake, a quarter of an hour
after, [[time]] enough to find again the thread of the discourse.  it is
necessary to speak after this manner to judges [[judge]], whom a [[man]] has a design
to gain over, [[right]] or [[wrong]], to [[children]] and [[common]] [[people]], to whom a
man must say all, and see what will come of it.  i would not have an
author make it his [[business]] to render me attentive: or that he should cry
out fifty times [[time]] oyez!  as the heralds do.  the romans, in their religious
exercises, began with ‘hoc age’ as we in ours do with ‘sursum corda’;
these are so many words lost to me: i come already fully prepared from my
chamber.  i need no allurement, no invitation, no sauce; i [[eat]] the meat
raw, so that, instead of whetting my appetite by these preparatives, they
tire and pall it.  will the licence of the [[time]] excuse my sacrilegious
boldness if i censure the dialogism of [[plato]] himself as also dull and
heavy, too much stifling the matter, and lament so much [[time]] lost by a
man, who had so many [[better]] things to say, in so many long and needless
preliminary interlocutions?  my ignorance will [[better]] excuse me in that
i [[understand]] not [[greek]] so well as to discern the [[beauty]] of his [[language]].
i generally choose books [[book]] that use sciences [[science]], not such as only lead to
them.  the two first, and pliny, and their like, have nothing of this hoc
age; they will have to do with [[men]] already instructed; or if they have,
‘tis a substantial hoc [[age]]; and that has a [[body]] by itself.  i also
delight in reading the epistles to atticus, not only because they contain
a [[great]] deal of the [[history]] and affairs of his [[time]], but much more
because i therein discover much of his own private humours [[humour]]; for i have a
singular curiosity, as i have said elsewhere, to pry into the souls [[soul]] and
the [[natural]] and true opinions [[opinion]] of the authors, with whom i converse.  a
man may indeed [[judge]] of their parts, but not of their manners nor of
themselves, by the writings they exhibit upon the theatre of the [[world]].
i have a thousand times [[time]] lamented the loss of the treatise brutus wrote
upon [[virtue]], for it is well to learn the theory from those who [[best]] know
the practice.

but seeing the matter preached and the preacher are different things,
i would as willingly see brutus in plutarch, as in a [[book]] of his own.
i would rather choose to be certainly informed of the conference he had
in his tent with some particular [[friends]] of his the night before a
battle, than of the harangue he made the next day to his [[army]]; and of
what he did in his closet and his chamber, than what he did in the public
square and in the senate.  as to cicero, i am of the [[common]] [[opinion]] that,
learning excepted, he had no [[great]] [[natural]] excellence.  he was a good
citizen, of an affable [[nature]], as all fat, heavy [[men]], such as he was,
usually are; but given to ease, and had, in [[truth]], a mighty share of
vanity and [[ambition]].  neither do i [[know]] how to excuse him for thinking
his poetry fit to be published; ‘tis no [[great]] imperfection to make ill
verses, but it is an imperfection not to be able to [[judge]] how unworthy
his verses were of the [[glory]] of his name.  for what concerns his
eloquence, that is totally out of all comparison, and i [[believe]] it will
never be equalled.  the younger cicero, who resembled his [[father]] in
nothing but in name, whilst commanding in [[asia]], had several strangers one
day at his table, and, amongst the rest, cestius seated at the lower end,
as [[men]] often intrude to the open tables of the [[great]].  cicero [[asked]] one
of his [[people]] who that [[man]] was, who presently told him his name; but he,
as one who had his thoughts [[thought]] taken up with something else, and who had
forgotten the [[answer]] made him, asking three or four times [[time]], over and over
again; the same [[question]], the fellow, to deliver himself from so many
answers and to make him [[know]] him by some particular circumstance; “‘tis
that cestius,” said he, “of whom it was told you, that he makes no great
account of your father’s eloquence in comparison of his own.”  at which
cicero, being suddenly nettled, commanded [[poor]] cestius presently to be
seized, and caused him to be very well whipped in his own presence; a
very discourteous entertainer!  yet even amongst those, who, all things
considered, have reputed his, eloquence incomparable, there have been
some, who have not stuck to observe some faults [[fault]] in it: as that great
brutus his friend, for [[example]], who said ‘twas a broken and feeble
eloquence, ‘fyactam et elumbem’.  the orators also, nearest to the age
wherein he lived, reprehended in him the [[care]] he had of a [[certain]] long
cadence in his periods, and particularly took notice of these words,
‘esse videatur’, which he there so often makes use of.  for my part, i
more approve of a shorter style, and that comes more roundly off.  he
does, though, sometimes shuffle his parts more briskly together, but ‘tis
very seldom.  i have myself taken notice of this one passage:

              “ego vero me minus diu senem mallem,
               quam esse senem, antequam essem.”

     [“i had rather be old a brief [[time]], than be old before old [[age]].
     --“cicero, de senect., c. 10.]

the historians are my [[right]] ball, for they are pleasant and easy, and
where [[man]], in general, the [[knowledge]] of whom i hunt after, appears more
vividly and entire than anywhere else:

     [the easiest of my amusements, the [[right]] ball at tennis being that
     which coming to the player from the [[right]] hand, is much easier
     played with.--coste.]

the variety and [[truth]] of his internal qualities, in gross and piecemeal,
the [[diversity]] of means by which he is [[united]] and knit, and the accidents
that threaten him.  now those that write lives [[life]], by [[reason]] they insist
more upon counsels than events, more upon what sallies from within, than
upon what happens without, are the most proper for my reading; and,
therefore, above all others, plutarch is the [[man]] for me.  i am very sorry
we have not a dozen laertii,--[diogenes laertius, who wrote the lives [[life]] of
the philosophers]--or that he was not further extended; for i am equally
curious to [[know]] the lives [[life]] and fortunes [[fortune]] of these [[great]] instructors of the
world, as to [[know]] the diversities of their doctrines and opinions [[opinion]].  in
this [[kind]] of study of histories [[history]], a [[man]] must tumble over, without
distinction, all sorts of authors, old and new, french or [[foreign]], there
to [[know]] the things of which they variously treat.  but caesar, in my
opinion, particularly deserves to be [[studied]], not for the [[knowledge]] of
the [[history]] only, but for himself, so [[great]] an excellence and perfection
he has above all the rest, though sallust be one of the number.  in
earnest, i [[read]] this author with more reverence and [[respect]] than is
usually allowed to [[human]] writings; one while considering him in his
person, by his actions and miraculous greatness, and another in the
purity and inimitable polish of his [[language]], wherein he not only excels
all other historians, as cicero confesses,  but, peradventure, even
cicero himself; speaking of his enemies [[enemy]] with so much sincerity in his
judgment, that, the false colours with which he strives to palliate his
evil cause, and the ordure of his pestilent [[ambition]] excepted, i think
there is no [[fault]] to be objected against him, saving this, that he speaks
too sparingly of himself, seeing so many [[great]] things could not have been
performed under his conduct, but that his own personal acts must
necessarily have had a greater share in them than he attributes to them.

i [[love]] historians, whether of the simple sort, or of the higher order.
the simple, who have nothing of their own to mix with it, and who only
make it their [[business]] to collect all that comes to their [[knowledge]], and
faithfully to record all things, without [[choice]] or discrimination, leave
to us the entire [[judgment]] of discerning the [[truth]].  such, for [[example]],
amongst others, is honest froissart, who has proceeded in his undertaking
with so frank a plainness that, having committed an error, he is not
ashamed to confess and [[correct]] it in the place where the finger has been
laid, and who represents to us even the variety of rumours that were then
spread abroad, and the different reports that were made to him; ‘tis the
naked and inform matter of [[history]], and of which every one may make his
profit, according to his understanding.  the more excellent sort of
historians have [[judgment]] to pick out what is most worthy to be known;
and, of two reports, to examine which is the most likely to be true: from
the condition of princes [[prince]] and their humours [[humour]], they conclude their counsels,
and attribute to them words proper for the [[occasion]]; such have title to
assume the [[authority]] of regulating our [[belief]] to what they themselves
believe; but certainly, this [[privilege]] belongs to very few.  for the
middle sort of historians, of which the most part are, they spoil all;
they will chew our meat for us; they take upon them to [[judge]] of, and
consequently, to incline the [[history]] to their own fancy; for if the
judgment lean to one side, a [[man]] cannot avoid wresting and writhing his
narrative to that bias; they undertake to select things worthy to be
known, and yet often conceal from us such a word, such a private action,
as would much [[better]] instruct us; omit, as incredible, such things as
they do not [[understand]], and peradventure some, because they cannot
express [[good]] french or latin.  let them display their eloquence and
intelligence, and [[judge]] according to their own fancy: but let them,
withal, leave us something to [[judge]] of after them, and neither alter nor
disguise, by their abridgments and at their own [[choice]], anything of the
substance of the matter, but deliver it to us pure and entire in all its
dimensions.

for the most part, and especially in these latter ages [[age]], persons [[person]] are
culled out for this [[work]] from amongst the [[common]] [[people]], upon the sole
consideration of well-speaking, as if we were to learn grammar from them;
and the [[men]] so chosen have [[fair]] [[reason]], being hired for no other end and
pretending to nothing but babble, not to be very solicitous of any part
but that, and so, with a fine jingle of words, prepare us a pretty
contexture of reports they pick up in the streets.  the only good
histories are those that have been written themselves who held command in
the affairs whereof they write, or who participated in the conduct of
them, or, at least, who have had the conduct of others of the same
nature.  such are almost all the [[greek]] and roman histories [[history]]: for, several
eye-witnesses having written of the same [[subject]], in the [[time]] when
grandeur and learning commonly met in the same [[person]], if there happen to
be an error, it must of necessity be a very slight one, and upon a very
doubtful incident.  what can a [[man]] expect from a physician who writes of
war, or from a mere scholar, treating of the designs of princes [[prince]]?  if we
could take notice how scrupulous the romans were in this, there would
need but this [[example]]: asinius pollio found in the histories [[history]] of caesar
himself something misreported, a mistake occasioned; either by [[reason]] he
could not have his eye in all parts of his [[army]] at once and had given
credit to some [[individual]] persons [[person]] who had not delivered him a very true
account; or else, for not having had too [[perfect]] notice given him by his
lieutenants of what they had done in his absence.--[suetonius, [[life]] of
caesar, c. 56.]--by which we may see, whether the inquisition after
truth be not very delicate, when a [[man]] cannot [[believe]] the report of a
battle from the [[knowledge]] of him who there commanded, nor from the
soldiers who were engaged in it, unless, after the method of a judicial
inquiry, the witnesses be confronted and objections considered upon the
proof of the least detail of every incident.  in [[good]] earnest the
knowledge we have of our own affairs, is much more obscure: but that has
been sufficiently handled by bodin, and according to my own sentiment
--[in the [[work]] by jean bodin, entitled “methodus ad facilem historiarum
cognitionem.”  1566.]--a little to aid the weakness of my memory (so
extreme that it has happened to me more than once, to take books [[book]] again
into my hand as new and unseen, that i had carefully [[read]] over a few
years before, and scribbled with my notes) i have adopted a custom of
late, to note at the end of every [[book]] (that is, of those i never intend
to [[read]] again) the [[time]] when i made an end on’t, and the [[judgment]] i had
made of it, to the end that this might, at least, represent to me the
character and general [[idea]] i had conceived of the author in reading it;
and i will here transcribe some of those annotations.

i wrote this, some ten years ago, in my guicciardini (of what language
soever my books [[book]] speak to me in, i always speak to them in my own): “he is
a diligent historiographer, from whom, in my [[opinion]], a [[man]] may learn the
truth of the affairs of his [[time]], as exactly as from any other; in the
most of which he was himself also a personal actor, and in honourable
command.  there is no appearance that he disguised anything, either upon
the account of [[hatred]], favour, or vanity; of which the [[free]] censures he
passes upon the [[great]] ones, and particularly those by whom he was
advanced and employed in commands of [[great]] trust and [[honour]], as pope
clement vii., give ample testimony.  as to that part which he thinks
himself the [[best]] at, namely, his digressions and discourses, he has
indeed some very [[good]], and enriched with fine features; but he is too
fond of them: for, to leave nothing unsaid, having a [[subject]] so full,
ample, almost infinite, he degenerates into pedantry and smacks a little
of scholastic prattle.  i have also observed this in him, that of so many
souls and so many effects, so many motives and so many counsels as he
judges, he never attributes any one to [[virtue]], [[religion]], or [[conscience]],
as if all these were utterly extinct in the [[world]]: and of all the
actions, how brave soever in outward show they appear in themselves, he
always refers the cause and motive to some vicious [[occasion]] or some
prospect of [[profit]].  it is impossible to imagine but that, amongst such
an infinite number of actions as he makes mention of, there must be some
one produced by the way of honest [[reason]].  no [[corruption]] could so
universally have infected [[men]] that some one would not escape the
contagion which makes me suspect that his own taste was vicious, whence
it might happen that he judged other [[men]] by himself.”

in my philip de commines there is this written: “you will here find the
language sweet and delightful, of a [[natural]] simplicity, the narration
pure, with the [[good]] [[faith]] of the author conspicuous therein; [[free]] from
vanity, when speaking of himself, and from affection or envy, when
speaking of others: his discourses and exhortations rather accompanied
with zeal and [[truth]], than with any exquisite sufficiency; and,
throughout, [[authority]] and gravity, which bespeak him a [[man]] of good
extraction, and brought up in [[great]] affairs.”

upon the memoirs of monsieur du bellay i find this: “‘tis always pleasant
to [[read]] things written by those that have experienced how they ought to
be carried on; but withal, it cannot be denied but there is a manifest
decadence in these two lords--[martin du bellay and guillaume de langey,
brothers, who jointly wrote the memoirs.]--from the [[freedom]] and liberty
of writing that shine in the elder historians, such as the sire de
joinville, the familiar companion of st. louis; eginhard, chancellor to
charlemagne; and of later date, philip de commines.  what we have here is
rather an apology for [[king]] francis, against the [[emperor]] charles v., than
history.  i will not [[believe]] that they have falsified anything, as to
matter of [[fact]]; but they make a [[common]] practice of twisting the judgment
of events, very often contrary to [[reason]], to our advantage, and of
omitting whatsoever is ticklish to be handled in the [[life]] of their
master; witness the proceedings of messieurs de montmorency and de biron,
which are here omitted: nay, so much as the very name of madame
d’estampes is not here to be found.  secret actions an historian may
conceal; but to pass over in [[silence]] what all the [[world]] knows [[know]] and things
that have drawn after them [[public]] and such high consequences, is an
inexcusable defect.  in fine, whoever has a [[mind]] to have a perfect
knowledge of [[king]] francis and the events of his reign, let him seek it
elsewhere, if my [[advice]] may prevail.  the only [[profit]] a [[man]] can reap from
these memoirs is in the special narrative of battles [[battle]] and other exploits
of [[war]] wherein these gentlemen were personally engaged; in some words and
private actions of the princes [[prince]] of their [[time]], and in the treaties and
negotiations carried on by the seigneur de langey, where there are
everywhere things worthy to be known, and discourses above the vulgar
strain.”




chapter xi

of cruelty

i fancy [[virtue]] to be something else, and something more [[noble]], than good
nature, and the mere propension to goodness, that we are born into the
world withal.  well-disposed and well-descended souls [[soul]] pursue, indeed, the
same methods, and represent in their actions the same face that virtue
itself does: but the word [[virtue]] imports, i [[know]] not what, more [[great]] and
active than merely for a [[man]] to suffer himself, by a [[happy]] disposition,
to be gently and quietly drawn to the [[rule]] of [[reason]].  he who, by a
natural sweetness and facility, should despise injuries received, would
doubtless do a very fine and laudable thing; but he who, provoked and
nettled to the quick by an offence, should fortify himself with the arms
of [[reason]] against the furious appetite of [[revenge]], and after a great
conflict, master his own passion, would certainly do a [[great]] deal more.
the first would do well; the latter virtuously: one action might be
called goodness, and the other [[virtue]]; for methinks, the very name of
virtue presupposes difficulty and contention, and cannot be exercised
without an opponent.  ‘tis for this [[reason]], perhaps, that we call god
good, mighty, liberal and just; but we do not call him [[virtuous]], being
that all his operations are [[natural]] and without endeavour.--[rousseau,
in his emile, [[book]] v., adopts this passage almost in the same words.]--
it has been the [[opinion]] of many [[philosophers]], not only stoics, but
epicureans--and this addition--

     [“montaigne stops here to make his excuse for thus naming the
     epicureans with the stoics, in conformity to the general opinion
     that the epicureans were not so rigid in their morals [[moral]] as the stoics,
     which is not true in the main, as he demonstrates at one view.  this
     involved montaigne in a tedious parenthesis, during which it is
     proper that the reader be attentive, that he may not entirely lose
     the thread of the argument.  in some later editions of this author,
     it has been attempted to remedy this inconvenience, but without
     observing that montaigne’s argument is rendered more feeble and
     obscure by such [[vain]] repetitions: it is a licence that ought not to
     be taken, because he who publishes the [[work]] of another, ought to
     give it as the other composed ft.  but, in mr cotton’s translation,
     he was so puzzled with this enormous parenthesis that he has quite
     left it out”--coste.]

i borrow from the vulgar [[opinion]], which is false, notwithstanding the
witty conceit of arcesilaus in [[answer]] to one, who, being reproached that
many scholars went from his school to the epicurean, but never any from
thence to his school, said in [[answer]], “i [[believe]] it indeed; numbers of
capons being made out of cocks, but never any cocks out of capons.”
 --[diogenes laertius, [[life]] of archesilaus, lib.  iv., 43.]--for, in [[truth]],
the epicurean sect is not at all inferior to the stoic in steadiness, and
the rigour of opinions [[opinion]] and precepts.  and a [[certain]] stoic, showing more
honesty than those disputants, who, in order to quarrel with epicurus,
and to throw the game into their hands, make him say what he never
thought, putting a [[wrong]] construction upon his words, clothing his
sentences, by the strict rules [[rule]] of grammar, with another meaning, and a
different [[opinion]] from that which they knew he entertained in his mind
and in his morals [[moral]], the stoic, i say, declared that he abandoned the
epicurean sect, upon this among other considerations, that he thought
their road too lofty and inaccessible;

     [“and those are called lovers of [[pleasure]], being in effect
     lovers of [[honour]] and [[justice]], who cultivate and observe all
     the virtues [[virtue]].”--cicero, ep.  fam., xv. i, 19.]

these [[philosophers]] say that it is not enough to have the [[soul]] seated in
a [[good]] place, of a [[good]] temper, and well disposed to [[virtue]]; it is not
enough to have our resolutions and our reasoning fixed above all the
power of [[fortune]], but that we are, moreover, to seek occasions [[occasion]] wherein to
put them to the proof: they would seek [[pain]], necessity, and contempt to
contend with them and to keep the [[soul]] in breath:

               “multum sibi adjicit virtus lacessita.”

               [“virtue is much strengthened by combats.”
                or:  “virtue attacked adds to its own [[force]].”
                --seneca, ep., 13.]

‘tis one of the reasons [[reason]] why epaminondas, who was yet of a third sect,
--[the pythagorean.]--refused the riches [[rich]] [[fortune]] presented to him by
very lawful means; because, said he, i am to contend with [[poverty]], in
which extreme he maintained himself to the [[last]].  [[socrates]] put himself,
methinks, upon a ruder [[trial]], keeping for his exercise a confounded
scolding [[wife]], which was fighting at sharps.  metellus having, of all the
roman senators, alone attempted, by the [[power]] of [[virtue]], to withstand the
violence of saturninus, tribune of the [[people]] at [[rome]], who would, by all
means, cause an [[unjust]] [[law]] to pass in favour of the commons [[common]], and, by so
doing, having incurred the [[capital]] penalties that saturninus had
established against the dissentient, entertained those who, in this
extremity, [[led]] him to execution with words to this effect: that it was a
thing too easy and too base to do ill; and that to do well where there
was no danger was a [[common]] thing; but that to do well where there was
danger was the proper office of a [[man]] of [[virtue]].  these words of metellus
very clearly represent to us what i would make out, viz., that virtue
refuses facility for a companion; and that the easy, smooth, and
descending way by which the regular steps of a sweet disposition of
nature are conducted is not that of a true [[virtue]]; she requires a rough
and stormy passage; she will have either exotic difficulties to wrestle
with, like that of metellus, by means whereof [[fortune]] delights to
interrupt the speed of her [[career]], or internal difficulties, that the
inordinate appetites and imperfections of our condition introduce to
disturb her.

i am come thus far at my ease; but here it comes into my head that the
soul of [[socrates]], the most [[perfect]] that ever came to my [[knowledge]], should
by this [[rule]] be of very little recommendation; for i cannot conceive in
that [[person]] any the least motion of a vicious inclination: i cannot
imagine there could be any difficulty or constraint in the course of his
virtue: i [[know]] his [[reason]] to be so powerful and [[sovereign]] over him that
she would never have [[suffered]] a vicious appetite so much as to spring in
him.  to a [[virtue]] so elevated as his, i have nothing to oppose.  methinks
i see him march, with a victorious and triumphant pace, in pomp and at
his ease, without opposition or disturbance.  if [[virtue]] cannot shine
bright, but by the conflict of contrary appetites, shall we then say that
she cannot subsist without the assistance of [[vice]], and that it is from
her that she derives her [[reputation]] and [[honour]]?  what then, also, would
become of that brave and generous epicurean [[pleasure]], which makes account
that it nourishes [[virtue]] tenderly in her lap, and there makes it play and
wanton, giving it for toys to play withal, shame, fevers, [[poverty]], [[death]],
and torments?  if i presuppose that a [[perfect]] [[virtue]] manifests itself in
contending, in patient enduring of [[pain]], and undergoing the uttermost
extremity of the gout; without being moved in her seat; if i give her
troubles and difficulty for her necessary objects: what will become of a
virtue elevated to such a [[degree]], as not only to despise [[pain]], but,
moreover, to rejoice in it, and to be tickled with the throes of a sharp
colic, such as the epicureans have established, and of which many of
them, by their actions, have given most manifest proofs?  as have several
others, who i find to have surpassed in effects even the very rules [[rule]] of
their discipline.  witness the younger cato: when i see him [[die]], and
tearing out his own bowels, i am not satisfied simply to [[believe]] that he
had then his [[soul]] totally exempt from all trouble and [[horror]]: i cannot
think that he only maintained himself in the steadiness that the stoical
rules prescribed him; temperate, without emotion, and imperturbed.  there
was, methinks, something in the [[virtue]] of this [[man]] too sprightly and
fresh to stop there; i [[believe]] that, without [[doubt]], he [[felt]] a pleasure
and delight in so [[noble]] an action, and was more pleased in it than in any
other of his [[life]]:

     “sic abiit a vita, ut causam moriendi nactum se esse gauderet.”

     [“he quitted [[life]] rejoicing that a [[reason]] for dying had arisen.”
      --cicero, tusc. quaes., i. 30.]

i [[believe]] it so thoroughly that i [[question]] whether he would have been
content to have been deprived of the [[occasion]] of so brave an exploit; and
if the goodness that made him embrace the [[public]] concern more than his
own, withheld me not, i should easily fall into an [[opinion]] that he
thought himself obliged to [[fortune]] for having put his [[virtue]] upon so
brave a [[trial]], and for having favoured that theif--[caesar]--in treading
underfoot the ancient [[liberty]] of his [[country]].  methinks i [[read]] in this
action i [[know]] not what exaltation in his [[soul]], and an extraordinary and
manly emotion of [[pleasure]], when he looked upon the generosity and height
of his enterprise:

                    “deliberate morte ferocior,”

          [“the more courageous from the deliberation to [[die]].”
           --horace, od., i. 37, 29.]

not stimulated with any [[hope]] of [[glory]], as the popular and effeminate
judgments of some have concluded (for that consideration was too mean and
low to possess so generous, so haughty, and so determined a [[heart]] as
his), but for the very [[beauty]] of the thing in itself, which he who had
the handling of the springs discerned more clearly and in its perfection
than we are able to do.  [[philosophy]] has obliged me in determining that so
brave an action had been indecently placed in any other [[life]] than that of
cato; and that it only appertained to his to end so; notwithstanding, and
according to [[reason]], he commanded his [[son]] and the senators who
accompanied him to take another course in their affairs:

          “catoni, quum incredibilem natura tribuisset gravitatem,
          eamque ipse perpetue constantia roboravisset, semperque
          in proposito consilio permansisset, moriendum potius,
          quam tyranni vultus aspiciendus, erat.”

     [“cato, whom [[nature]] had given incredible [[dignity]], which he had
     fortified by perpetual constancy, ever remaining of his
     predetermined [[opinion]], preferred to [[die]] rather than to look
     on the countenance of a [[tyrant]].”--cicero, de ofc., i. 31.]

every [[death]] ought to hold proportion with the [[life]] before it; we do not
become others for dying.  i always interpret the [[death]] by the life
preceding; and if any one tell me of a [[death]] [[strong]] and constant in
appearance, annexed to a feeble [[life]], i conclude it produced by some
feeble cause, and suitable to the [[life]] before.  the easiness then of his
death and the facility of dying he had acquired by the vigour of his
soul; shall we say that it ought to abate anything of the lustre of his
virtue?  and who, that has his brain never so little tinctured with the
true [[philosophy]], can be content to imagine [[socrates]] only [[free]] from fear
and passion in the accident of his prison, fetters, and condemnation?
and that will not discover in him not only firmness and constancy (which
was his ordinary condition), but, moreover, i [[know]] not what new
satisfaction, and a frolic cheerfulness in his [[last]] words and actions?
in the start he gave with the [[pleasure]] of scratching his leg when his
irons were taken off, does he not discover an [[equal]] serenity and joy in
his [[soul]] for being freed from [[past]] inconveniences, and at the same time
to enter into the [[knowledge]] of the things to come?  cato shall pardon me,
if he please; his [[death]] indeed is more tragical and more lingering; but
yet this is, i [[know]] not how, methinks, finer.  aristippus, to one that
was lamenting this [[death]]: “the gods grant me such an one,” said he.
a [[man]] discerns in the [[soul]] of these two [[great]] [[men]] and their imitators
(for i very much [[doubt]] whether there were ever their equals) so [[perfect]] a
habitude to [[virtue]], that it was turned to a [[complexion]].  it is no longer
a laborious [[virtue]], nor the precepts of [[reason]], to maintain which the
soul is so racked, but the very essence of their [[soul]], its [[natural]] and
ordinary habit; they have rendered it such by a long practice of
philosophical precepts having lit upon a [[rich]] and fine [[nature]]; the
vicious [[passions]] that spring in us can find no entrance into them; the
force and vigour of their [[soul]] stifle and extinguish irregular desires [[desire]],
so soon as they begin to move.

now, that it is not more [[noble]], by a high and [[divine]] resolution, to
hinder the birth of temptations, and to be so formed to [[virtue]], that the
very seeds of [[vice]] are rooted out, than to hinder by main [[force]] their
progress; and, having [[suffered]] ourselves to be surprised with the first
motions of the [[passions]], to arm ourselves and to stand firm to oppose
their [[progress]], and overcome them; and that this second effect is not
also much more generous than to be simply endowed with a facile and
affable [[nature]], of itself disaffected to debauchery and [[vice]], i do not
think can be doubted; for this third and [[last]] sort of [[virtue]] seems to
render a [[man]] [[innocent]], but not [[virtuous]]; [[free]] from doing ill, but not apt
enough to do well: considering also, that this condition is so near
neighbour to imperfection and cowardice, that i [[know]] not very well how to
separate the confines and distinguish them: the very names of goodness
and innocence are, for this [[reason]], in some sort grown into contempt.
i very well [[know]] that several virtues [[virtue]], as chastity, sobriety, and
temperance, may come to a [[man]] through personal defects.  constancy in
danger, if it must be so called, the contempt of [[death]], and patience in
misfortunes, may ofttimes be found in [[men]] for want of well judging of
such accidents, and not apprehending them for such as they are.  want of
apprehension and stupidity sometimes counterfeit [[virtuous]] effects as i
have often seen it happen, that [[men]] have been commended for what really
merited blame.  an italian [[lord]] once said this, in my presence, to the
disadvantage of his own nation: that the subtlety of the italians, and
the vivacity of their conceptions were so [[great]], and they foresaw the
dangers and accidents that might befall them so far off, that it was not
to be [[thought]] [[strange]], if they were often, in [[war]], observed to provide
for their safety, even before they had discovered the peril; that we
french and the spaniards, who were not so cunning, went on further, and
that we must be made to see and [[feel]] the danger before we would take the
alarm; but that even then we could not stick to it.  but the germans and
swiss, more gross and heavy, had not the sense to look about them, even
when the blows were falling about their ears.  peradventure, he only
talked so for mirth’s sake; and yet it is most [[certain]] that in [[war]] raw
soldiers rush into dangers with more precipitancy than after they have
been cudgelled*--(the original has eschauldex--scalded)

         “haud ignarus .  .  .  .  quantum nova gloria in armis,
          et praedulce decus, primo certamine possit.”

     [“not ignorant how much [[power]] the fresh [[glory]] of arms and sweetest
     [[honour]] possess in the first contest.”--aeneid, xi. 154]

for this [[reason]] it is that, when we [[judge]] of a particular action, we are
to consider the circumstances, and the whole [[man]] by whom it is performed,
before we give it a name.

to instance in myself: i have sometimes known my [[friends]] call that
prudence in me, which was merely [[fortune]]; and repute that [[courage]] and
patience, which was [[judgment]] and [[opinion]]; and attribute to me one title
for another, sometimes to my advantage and sometimes otherwise.  as to
the rest, i am so far from being arrived at the first and most perfect
degree of excellence, where [[virtue]] is turned into habit, that even of the
second i have made no [[great]] proofs.  i have not been very solicitous to
curb the desires [[desire]] by which i have been importuned.  my [[virtue]] is a [[virtue]],
or rather an innocence, casual and accidental.  if i had been born of a
more irregular [[complexion]], i am afraid i should have made scurvy [[work]];
for i never observed any [[great]] stability in my [[soul]] to resist [[passions]],
if they were never so little vehement: i [[know]] not how to nourish quarrels
and debates in my own bosom, and, consequently, owe myself no great
thanks that i am [[free]] from several vices [[vice]]:

              “si vitiis mediocribus et mea paucis
               mendosa est natura, alioqui recta, velut si
               egregio inspersos reprehendas corpore naevos:”

     [“if my [[nature]] be disfigured only with slight and few vices [[vice]], and is
     otherwise just, it is as if you should blame moles on a [[fair]] [[body]].”
      --horatius, sat., i. 6, 65.]

i owe it rather to my [[fortune]] than my [[reason]].  she has caused me to be
descended of a [[race]] famous for integrity and of a very [[good]] [[father]]; i
know not whether or no he has infused into me part of his humours [[humour]], or
whether domestic examples [[example]] and the [[good]] [[education]] of my infancy have
insensibly assisted in the [[work]], or, if i was otherwise born so:

                    “seu libra, seu me scorpius adspicit
                    formidolosus, pars violentior
                    natalis hors, seu tyrannus
                    hesperive capricornus undae:”

     [“whether the balance or dread scorpio, more potent over my natal
     hour, aspects me, or capricorn, supreme over the hesperian sea.”
      --horace, od., ii. 117.]

but so it is, that i have naturally a [[horror]] for most vices [[vice]].  the answer
of antisthenes to him who [[asked]] him, which was the [[best]] apprenticeship
“to unlearn [[evil]],” seems to point at this.  i have them in [[horror]], i say,
with a detestation so [[natural]], and so much my own, that the same instinct
and impression i brought of them with me from my nurse, i yet retain, and
no temptation whatever has had the [[power]] to make me alter it.  not so
much as my own discourses, which in some things lashing out of the common
road might seem easily to license me to actions that my natural
inclination makes me hate.  i will say a prodigious thing, but i will say
it, however: i find myself in many things more under [[reputation]] by my
manners than by my [[opinion]], and my concupiscence less debauched than my
reason.  aristippus instituted opinions [[opinion]] so bold in favour of [[pleasure]] and
riches as set all the [[philosophers]] against him: but as to his manners,
dionysius the [[tyrant]], having presented three beautiful [[women]] before him,
to take his [[choice]]; he made [[answer]], that he would choose them all, and
that [[paris]] got himself into trouble for having preferred one before the
other two: but, having taken them [[home]] to his house, he sent them back
untouched.  his servant finding himself overladen upon the way, with the
money he carried after him, he ordered him to pour out and throw away
that which troubled him.  and epicurus, whose doctrines were so
irreligious and effeminate, was in his [[life]] very laborious and devout;
he wrote to a friend of his that he lived only upon biscuit and water,
entreating him to send him a little cheese, to [[lie]] by him against he had
a [[mind]] to make a feast.  must it be true, that to be a [[perfect]] [[good]] [[man]],
we must be so by an occult, [[natural]], and universal propriety, without
law, [[reason]], or [[example]]?  the debauches wherein i have been engaged, have
not been, i thank [[god]], of the worst sort, and i have condemned them in
myself, for my [[judgment]] was never infected by them; on the contrary,
i accuse them more severely in myself than in any other; but that is all,
for, as to the rest.  i oppose too little [[resistance]] and suffer myself to
incline too much to the other side of the balance, excepting that i
moderate them, and prevent them from mixing with other vices [[vice]], which for
the most part will cling together, if a [[man]] have not a [[care]].  i have
contracted and curtailed mine, to make them as [[single]] and as simple as i
can:

                              “nec ultra
                    errorem foveo.”

               [“nor do i cherish error further.”
                or: “nor carry [[wrong]] further.”
                --juvenal, viii. 164.]

for as to the [[opinion]] of the stoics, who say, “that the [[wise]] [[man]] when he
works, works [[work]] by all the virtues [[virtue]] together, though one be most apparent,
according to the [[nature]] of the action”; and herein the similitude of a
human [[body]] might serve them somewhat, for the action of anger cannot
work, unless all the humours [[humour]] assist it, though choler predominate;
--if they will thence draw a like consequence, that when the wicked man
does wickedly, he does it by all the vices [[vice]] together, i do not [[believe]] it
to be so, or else i [[understand]] them not, for i by effect find the
contrary.  these are sharp, unsubstantial subleties, with which
philosophy sometimes amuses itself.  i [[follow]] some vices [[vice]], but i fly
others as much as a saint would do.  the peripatetics also disown this
indissoluble connection; and [[aristotle]] is of [[opinion]] that a prudent and
just [[man]] may be intemperate and inconsistent.  [[socrates]] confessed to some
who had discovered a [[certain]] inclination to [[vice]] in his physiognomy, that
it was, in [[truth]], his [[natural]] propension, but that he had by discipline
corrected it.  and such as were familiar with the philosopher stilpo
said, that being born with addiction to wine and [[women]], he had by study
rendered himself very abstinent both from the one and the other.

what i have in me of [[good]], i have, quite contrary, by the [[chance]] of my
birth; and hold it not either by [[law]], precept, or any other instruction;
the innocence that is in me is a simple one; little vigour and no art [[arts]].
amongst other vices [[vice]], i mortally hate [[cruelty]], both by [[nature]] and
judgment, as the very extreme of all vices [[vice]]: nay, with so much tenderness
that i cannot see a chicken’s neck pulled off without trouble, and cannot
without [[impatience]] endure the cry of a hare in my dog’s teeth, though the
chase be a [[violent]] [[pleasure]].  such as have sensuality to encounter,
freely make use of this argument, to shew that it is altogether “vicious
and unreasonable; that when it is at the height, it masters us to that
degree that a man’s [[reason]] can have no access,” and instance our own
experience in the act of [[love]],

                    “quum jam praesagit gaudia corpus,
                    atque in eo est [[venus]],
                    ut muliebria conserat arva.”

     [none of the translators of the old editions used for this etext
     have been willing to translate this passage from lucretius, iv.
     1099; they take a cop out by bashfully saying: “the sense is in the
     preceding passage of the text.”  d.w.]

wherein they conceive that the [[pleasure]] so transports us, that our reason
cannot perform its office, whilst we are in such ecstasy and rapture.  i
know very well it may be otherwise, and that a [[man]] may sometimes, if he
will, gain this point over himself to sway his [[soul]], even in the critical
moment, to [[think]] of something else; but then he must ply it to that bent.
i [[know]] that a [[man]] may triumph over the utmost effort of this [[pleasure]]: i
have experienced it in myself, and have not found [[venus]] so imperious a
goddess, as many, and much more [[virtuous]] [[men]] than i, declare.  i do not
consider it a miracle, as the queen of navarre does in one of the tales
of her heptameron--[“vu gentil liure pour [[son]] estoffe.”]--(which is a
very pretty [[book]] of its kind), nor for a thing of extreme difficulty, to
pass whole nights, where a [[man]] has all the convenience and [[liberty]] he can
desire, with a long-coveted mistress, and yet be true to the pledge first
given to satisfy himself with kisses and suchlike endearments, without
pressing any further.  i conceive that the [[example]] of the [[pleasure]] of the
chase would be more proper; wherein though the [[pleasure]] be less, there is
the higher excitement of unexpected joy, giving no [[time]] for the [[reason]],
taken by surprise, to prepare itself for the encounter, when after a long
quest the beast starts up on a sudden in a place where, peradventure, we
least expected it; the shock and the ardour of the shouts and cries of
the hunters so strike us, that it would be hard for those who [[love]] this
lesser chase, to turn their thoughts [[thought]] upon the instant another way; and
the poets make diana triumph over the torch and shafts of cupid:

              “quis non malarum, quas amor curas habet,
               haec inter obliviscitur?”

     [“who, amongst such delights would not remove out of his thoughts
     the anxious cares [[care]] of [[love]].”--horace, epod., ii. 37.]

to return to what i was saying before, i am tenderly compassionate of
others’ afflictions, and should readily cry for company, if, upon any
occasion whatever, i could cry at all.  nothing tempts my tears but
tears, and not only those that are real and true, but whatever they are,
feigned or painted.  i do not much lament the [[dead]], and should envy them
rather; but i very much lament the dying.  the savages do not so much
offend me, in roasting and eating the bodies [[body]] of the [[dead]], as they do who
torment and [[persecute]] the living.  nay, i cannot look so much as upon the
ordinary executions of [[justice]], how reasonable soever, with a steady eye.
some one having to give testimony of julius caesar’s clemency; “he was,”
 says he, “mild in his revenges.  having compelled the pirates to yield by
whom he had before been taken [[prisoner]] and put to ransom; forasmuch as he
had threatened them with the cross, he indeed condemned them to it, but
it was after they had been first strangled.  he punished his secretary
philemon, who had attempted to poison him, with no greater severity than
mere [[death]].”  without naming that latin author,--[suetonius, [[life]] of
casay, c. 74.]--who thus dares to allege as a testimony of [[mercy]] the
killing only of those by whom we have been offended; it is easy to guess
that he was struck with the horrid and inhuman examples [[example]] of cruelty
practised by the roman tyrants [[tyrant]].

for my part, even in [[justice]] itself, all that exceeds a simple death
appears to me pure [[cruelty]]; especially in us who ought, having regard to
their souls [[soul]], to dismiss them in a [[good]] and calm condition; which cannot
be, when we have agitated them by insufferable torments.  not long since,
a soldier who was a [[prisoner]], perceiving from a tower where he was shut
up, that the [[people]] began to assemble to the place of execution, and that
the carpenters were busy erecting a scaffold, he presently concluded
that the preparation was for him, and therefore entered into a resolution
to kill himself, but could find no instrument to assist him in his design
except an old rusty cart-nail that [[fortune]] presented to him; with this he
first gave himself two [[great]] wounds about his throat, but finding these
would not do, he presently afterwards gave himself a third in the belly,
where he left the nail sticking up to the head.  the first of his keepers
who came in found him in this condition: yet alive, but sunk down and
exhausted by his wounds.  to make use of [[time]], therefore, before he
should [[die]], they made haste to [[read]] his sentence; which having done, and
he hearing that he was only condemned to be beheaded, he seemed to take
new [[courage]], accepted wine which he had before refused, and thanked his
judges for the unhoped-for mildness of their sentence; saying, that he
had taken a resolution to despatch himself for [[fear]] of a more severe and
insupportable [[death]], having entertained an [[opinion]], by the preparations
he had seen in the place, that they were resolved to torment him with
some horrible execution, and seemed to be delivered from [[death]] in having
it changed from what he apprehended.

i should advise that those examples [[example]] of severity by which ‘tis designed to
retain the [[people]] in their [[duty]], might be exercised upon the [[dead]] bodies
of criminals [[criminal]]; for to see them deprived of sepulture, to see them boiled
and divided into quarters, would almost [[work]] as much upon the vulgar, as
the [[pain]] they make the living endure; though that in effect be little or
nothing, as [[god]] himself says, “who kill the [[body]], and after that have no
more that they can do;”--[luke, xii.  4.]--and the poets singularly
dwell upon the horrors of this picture, as something worse than [[death]]:

         “heu! reliquias semiustas regis, denudatis ossibus,
          per terram sanie delibutas foede divexarier.”

     [“alas! that the half-burnt remains of the [[king]], exposing his bones,
     should be foully dragged along the ground besmeared with gore.”
      --cicero, tusc. quaes., i. 44.]

i happened to come by one day accidentally at [[rome]], just as they were
upon executing catena, a notorious robber: he was strangled without any
emotion of the spectators, but when they came to cut him in quarters, the
hangman gave not a blow that the [[people]] did not [[follow]] with a doleful cry
and exclamation, as if every one had lent his sense of feeling to the
miserable carcase.  those inhuman excesses ought to be exercised upon the
bark, and not upon the quick.  artaxerxes, in almost a like case,
moderated the severity of the ancient laws [[law]] of [[persia]], ordaining that the
nobility who had committed a [[fault]], instead of being whipped, as they
were used to be, should be stripped only and their clothes whipped for
them; and that whereas they were wont to tear off their hair, they should
only take off their high-crowned tiara.’--[plutarch, notable sayings of
the ancient [[king]].]--the so devout [[egyptians]] [[thought]] they sufficiently
satisfied the [[divine]] [[justice]] by sacrificing hogs in effigy and
representation; a bold invention to [[pay]] [[god]] so essential a substance in
picture only and in show.

i [[live]] in a [[time]] wherein we abound in incredible examples [[example]] of this [[vice]],
through the licence of our civil wars [[war]]; and we see nothing in ancient
histories more extreme than what we have proof of every day, but i
cannot, any the more, get used to it.  i could hardly persuade myself,
before i saw it with my [[eyes]], that there could be found souls [[soul]] so cruel
and fell, who, for the sole [[pleasure]] of murder, would commit it; would
hack and lop off the limbs of others; sharpen their wits to invent
unusual torments and new kinds [[kind]] of [[death]], without [[hatred]], without [[profit]],
and for no other end but only to enjoy the pleasant spectacle of the
gestures and motions, the lamentable groans and cries of a [[man]] dying in
anguish.  for this is the utmost point to which [[cruelty]] can arrive:

              “ut homo hominem, non iratus, non timens,
               tantum spectaturus, occidat.”

     [“that a [[man]] should kill a [[man]], not being angry, not in [[fear]], only
     for the sake of the spectacle.”--seneca, ep., 90.]

for my own part, i cannot without [[grief]] see so much as an [[innocent]] beast
pursued and killed that has no defence, and from which we have received
no offence at all; and that which frequently happens, that the stag we
hunt, finding himself [[weak]] and out of breath, and seeing no other remedy,
surrenders himself to us who pursue him, imploring [[mercy]] by his tears:

                        “questuque cruentus,
                         atque imploranti similis,”

          [“who, bleeding, by his tears seems to crave [[mercy]].”
           --aenead, vii. 501.]

has ever been to me a very unpleasing sight; and i hardly ever take a
beast alive that i do not presently turn out again.  pythagoras bought
them of fishermen and fowlers to do the same:

                    “primoque a caede ferarum,
               incaluisse puto maculatum sanguine ferrum.”


     [“i [[think]] ‘twas slaughter of wild beasts that first stained the
     steel of [[man]] with [[blood]].”--ovid, met., xv. 106.]

those natures [[nature]] that are sanguinary towards beasts discover a natural
proneness to [[cruelty]].  after they had accustomed themselves at [[rome]] to
spectacles of the slaughter of animals, they proceeded to those of the
slaughter of [[men]], of gladiators.  [[nature]] has herself, i [[fear]], imprinted
in [[man]] a [[kind]] of instinct to inhumanity; nobody takes [[pleasure]] in seeing
beasts play with and caress one another, but every one is delighted with
seeing them dismember, and tear one another to pieces.  and that i may
not be laughed at for the sympathy i have with them, theology itself
enjoins us some favour in their behalf; and considering that one and the
same master has lodged us together in this palace for his service, and
that they, as well as we, are of his [[family]], it has [[reason]] to enjoin us
some affection and regard to them.  pythagoras borrowed the
metempsychosis from the [[egyptians]]; but it has since been received by
several nations, and particularly by our druids:

          “morte carent animae; semperque, priore relicts
          sede, novis domibus vivunt, habitantque receptae.”

     [“souls never [[die]], but, having left their former seat, live
     and are received into new homes [[home]].”--ovid, met., xv. 158.]

the [[religion]] of our ancient gauls maintained that souls [[soul]], being eternal,
never ceased to remove and shift their places from one [[body]] to another;
mixing moreover with this fancy some consideration of [[divine]] [[justice]]; for
according to the deportments of the [[soul]], whilst it had been in
alexander, they said that [[god]] assigned it another [[body]] to inhabit, more
or less painful, and proper for its condition:

                              “muta ferarum
               cogit vincla pati; truculentos ingerit ursis,
               praedonesque lupis; fallaces vulpibus addit:
               atque ubi per varios annos, per mille figuras

               egit, lethaeo purgatos flumine, tandem
               rursus ad humanae revocat primordia formae:”

     [“he makes them wear the silent chains of brutes, the bloodthirsty
     souls [[soul]] he encloses in bears, the thieves in wolves, the deceivers in
     foxes; where, after successive years and a thousand forms, [[man]] had
     spent his [[life]], and after purgation in lethe’s flood, at [[last]] he
     restores them to the primordial [[human]] shapes.”
      --claudian, in ruf., ii. 482.]

if it had been valiant, he lodged it in the [[body]] of a lion; if
voluptuous, in that of a hog; if timorous, in that of a hart or hare; if
malicious, in that of a fox, and so of the rest, till having purified it
by this chastisement, it again entered into the [[body]] of some other [[man]]:

               “ipse ego nam memini, trojani, tempore belli
               panthoides euphorbus eram.”

     [“for i myself [[remember]] that, in the days of the trojan [[war]], i was
     euphorbus, [[son]] of pantheus.”--ovid, met., xv. 160; and see diogenes
     laertius, [[life]] of pythagoras.]

as to the relationship betwixt us and beasts, i do not much admit of it;
nor of that which several nations, and those among the most ancient and
most [[noble]], have practised, who have not only received brutes into their
society and companionship, but have given them a rank infinitely above
themselves, esteeming them one while familiars and favourites of the
gods, and having them in more than [[human]] reverence and [[respect]]; others
acknowledged no other [[god]] or divinity than they:

          “bellux a barbaris propter beneficium consecratae.”

     [“beasts, out of [[opinion]] of some benefit received by them, were
     consecrated by barbarians”--cicero, de natura deor., i. 36.]


                              “crocodilon adorat
               pars haec; illa pavet saturam serpentibus ibin:
               effigies sacri hic nitet aurea cercopitheci;
                              hic piscem flumints, illic
               oppida tota canem venerantur.”

     [“this place adores the crocodile; another dreads the ibis, feeder
     on serpents; here shines the golden image of the [[sacred]] ape; here
     [[men]] venerate the fish of the river; there whole towns [[worship]] a
     dog.”--juvenal, xv. 2.]

and the very interpretation that plutarch, gives to this error, which is
very well conceived, is advantageous to them: for he says that it was not
the cat or the ox, for [[example]], that the [[egyptians]] adored: but that they,
in those beasts, adored some image of the [[divine]] faculties; in this,
patience and utility: in that, vivacity, or, as with our neighbours the
burgundians and all the germans, [[impatience]] to see themselves shut up; by
which they represented [[liberty]], which they loved and adored above all
other godlike attributes, and so of the rest.  but when, amongst the more
moderate opinions [[opinion]], i meet with arguments that endeavour to demonstrate
the near resemblance betwixt us and animals, how large a share they have
in our [[greatest]] privileges [[privilege]], and with how much probability they compare us
together, truly i abate a [[great]] deal of our presumption, and willingly
resign that imaginary sovereignty that is attributed to us over other
creatures.

but supposing all this were not true, there is nevertheless a certain
respect, a general [[duty]] of [[humanity]], not only to beasts that have life
and sense, but even to trees, and plants.  we owe [[justice]] to [[men]], and
graciousness and benignity to other creatures that are capable of it;
there is a [[certain]] commerce and mutual obligation betwixt them and us.
nor shall i be afraid to confess the tenderness of my [[nature]] so childish,
that i cannot well refuse to play with my dog, when he the most
unseasonably importunes me to do so.  the turks have alms and hospitals
for beasts.  the romans had [[public]] [[care]] to the nourishment of geese, by
whose vigilance their capitol had been preserved.  the athenians made a
decree that the mules and moyls which had served at the building of the
temple called hecatompedon should be [[free]] and [[suffered]] to pasture at
their own [[choice]], without hindrance.  the agrigentines  had a [[common]] use
solemnly to inter the beasts they had a [[kindness]] for, as horses of some
rare quality, dogs, and useful birds, and even those that had only been
kept to divert their [[children]]; and the magnificence that was ordinary
with them in all other things, also particularly appeared in the
sumptuosity and numbers of monuments erected to this end, and which
remained in their [[beauty]] several ages [[age]] after.  the [[egyptians]] buried
wolves, bears, crocodiles, dogs, and cats in [[sacred]] places, embalmed
their bodies [[body]], and put on mourning at their [[death]].  cimon gave an
honourable sepulture to the mares with which he had three times [[time]] gained
the prize of the course at the olympic games.  the ancient xantippus
caused his dog to be interred on an eminence near the sea, which has ever
since retained the name, and plutarch says, that he had a scruple about
selling for a small [[profit]] to the slaughterer an ox that had been long in
his service.



chapter xii.  apology for raimond sebond.

learning is, indeed, a very [[great]] and a very material accomplishment;
and those who despise it sufficiently discover their own want of
understanding; but learning yet i do not prize it at the excessive rate
that some others do, as herillus, the philosopher, for one, who therein
places the [[sovereign]] [[good]], and maintained “that it was only in her to
render us [[wise]] and contented,” which i do not [[believe]]; no more than i
do what others have said, that learning is the [[mother]] of all [[virtue]], and
that all [[vice]] proceeds from ignorance, which, if it be true, required
a very long interpretation. my house has long-been open to [[men]] of
knowledge, and is very well known to them; for my [[father]], who governed
it fifty years and upwards, inflamed with the new ardour with which
francis the first embraced letters, and brought them into esteem, with
great diligence and expense hunted after the acquaintance of learned
men, receiving them into his house as persons [[person]] [[sacred]], and that had some
particular inspiration of [[divine]] [[wisdom]]; collecting their sayings and
sentences as so many oracles, and with so much the greater reverence
and [[religion]] as he was the less able to [[judge]] of them; for he had no
knowledge of letters any more than his predecessors. for my part i love
them well, but i do not adore them. amongst others, peter bunel, a man
of [[great]] [[reputation]] for [[knowledge]] in his [[time]], having, with some others
of his sort, staid some days at montaigne in my father’s company,
he presented him at his departure with a [[book]], entitled _theologia
naturalis; sive liber creaturarum, magistri raimondi de sebonde._ and as
the italian and spanish tongues were familiar to my [[father]], and as this
book was written in a sort of jargon of spanish with latin terminations,
he hoped that, with a little [[help]], he might be able to [[understand]] it,
and therefore recommended it to him for a very useful [[book]], and proper
tor the [[time]] wherein he gave it to him; which was when the novel
doctrines of luther began to be in vogue, and in many places to stagger
our ancient [[belief]]: wherein he was very well advised, wisely, in his own
reason, foreseeing that the beginning of this distemper would easily
run into an execrable atheism, for the vulgar, not having the faculty of
judging of things, suffering themselves to be carried away by [[chance]] and
appearance, after having once been inspired with the boldness to
despise and control those opinions [[opinion]] which they had before had in extreme
reverence, such as those wherein their salvation is concerned, and
that some of the articles of their [[religion]] are brought into [[doubt]] and
dispute, they afterwards throw all other parts of their [[belief]] into the
same uncertainty, they having with them no other [[authority]] or foundation
than the others they had already discomposed; and shake off all the
impressions they had received from the [[authority]] of the laws [[law]], or the
reverence of the ancient customs, as a [[tyrannical]] yoke:


   nam cupide eonculcatur nimis ante metutum;


   “for with most eagerness they spurn the [[law]],
   by which they were before most kept in awe;”


resolving to admit nothing for the future to which they had not first
interposed their own decrees, and given their particular [[consent]].

it happened that my [[father]], a little before his [[death]], having
accidentally found this [[book]] under a heap of other neglected papers,
commanded me to translate it for him into french. it is [[good]] too
translate such authors as this, where there is little but the matter
itself to express; but such wherein grace of [[language]] and elegance of
style are aimed at, are dangerous to attempt, especially when a [[man]] is
to turn them into a weaker idiom. it was a [[strange]] and a new undertaking
for me; but having by [[chance]] at that [[time]] nothing else to do, and not
being able to resist the command of the [[best]] [[father]] that ever was, i did
it as well as i could; and he was so well pleased with it as to order it
to be printed, which after his [[death]] was done.

i found the ideas [[idea]] of this author exceeding fine the contexture of his
work well followed, and his design full of piety; and because many
people take a delight to [[read]] it, and particularly the ladies [[lady]], to whom
we owe the most service, i have often [[thought]] to assist them to clear
the [[book]] of two principal objections made to it. his design is bold and
daring, for he undertakes, by [[human]] and [[natural]] reasons [[reason]], to establish
and make [[good]], against the atheists, all the articles of the christian
religion: wherein, to speak the [[truth]], he is so firm and so successful
that i do not [[think]] it possible to do [[better]] upon that [[subject]]; nay, i
believe he has been equalled by none. this [[work]] seeming to me to be too
beautiful and too [[rich]] for an author whose name is so little known, and
of whom all that we [[know]] is that he was a spaniard, practising physic at
toulouse about two hundred years ago; i enquired of adrian turnebus, who
knew all things, what he [[thought]] of that [[book]]; who made [[answer]], “that he
thought it was some abstract drawn from st. thomas d’aquin; for that, in
truth, his [[mind]], so full of infinite erudition and admirable subtlety,
was alone capable of such thoughts [[thought]].” be this as it may, whoever was the
author and inventor (and ‘tis not reasonable, without greater certainty,
to deprive sebond of that title), he was a [[man]] of [[great]] [[judgment]] and
most admirable parts.

the first thing they reprehend in his [[work]] is “that christians [[christian]] are to
blame to repose their [[belief]] upon [[human]] [[reason]], which is only conceived
by [[faith]] and the particular inspiration of [[divine]] grace.” in which
objection there appears to be something of zeal to piety, and therefore
we are to endeavour to satisfy those who put it forth with the greater
mildness and [[respect]]. this were a task more proper for a [[man]] well
read in divinity than for me, who [[know]] nothing of it; nevertheless, i
conceive that in a thing so [[divine]], so high, and so far transcending
all [[human]] [[intelligence]], as is that [[truth]], with which it has pleased
the bounty of [[god]] to enlighten us, it is very necessary that he should
moreover lend us his assistance, as a very extraordinary favour and
privilege, to conceive and imprint it in our understanding. and i do
not [[believe]] that means purely [[human]] are in any sort capable of doing it:
for, if they were, so many rare and excellent souls [[soul]], and so abundantly
furnished with [[natural]] [[force]], in former ages [[age]], could not have failed,
by their [[reason]], to arrive at this [[knowledge]]. ‘tis [[faith]] alone that
livelily [[mind]] certainly comprehends the deep mysteries of our [[religion]];
but, withal, i do not say that it is not a worthy and very laudable
attempt to accommodate those [[natural]] and [[human]] utensils with which god
has endowed us to the service of our [[faith]]: it is not to be doubted but
that it is the most [[noble]] use we can put them to; and that there is not
a design in a [[christian]] [[man]] more [[noble]] than to make it the aim and end
of all his studies to extend and amplify the [[truth]] of his [[belief]]. we do
not satisfy ourselves with serving [[god]] with our souls [[soul]] and understandings
only, we moreover owe and render him a corporal reverence, and apply our
limbs and motions, and external things to do him [[honour]]; we must here
do the same, and accompany our [[faith]] with all the [[reason]] we have, but
always with this reservation, not to fancy that it is upon us that
it depends, nor that our arguments and endeavours can arrive at so
supernatural and [[divine]] a [[knowledge]]. if it enters not into us by an
extraordinary infusion; if it enters not only by [[reason]], but, moreover,
by [[human]] ways, it is not in us in its true [[dignity]] and splendour: and
yet, i am afraid, we only have it by this way.

if we hold upon [[god]] by the mediation of a lively [[faith]]; if we hold upon
god by him, and not by us; if we had a [[divine]] basis and foundation,
human occasions [[occasion]] would not have the [[power]] to shake us as they do; our
fortress would not [[surrender]] to so [[weak]] a battery; the [[love]] of novelty,
the constraint of princes [[prince]], the [[success]] of one party, and the rash and
fortuitous [[change]] of our opinions [[opinion]], would not have the [[power]] to stagger
and alter our [[belief]]: we should not then leave it to the [[mercy]] of every
new argument, nor abandon it to all the rhetoric in the [[world]]; we should
withstand the fury of these waves with an immovable and unyielding
constancy:


   as a [[great]] rock repels the rolling tides,

   that foam and bark about her marble sides,
   from its [[strong]] bulk


if we were but touched with this ray of divinity, it would appear
throughout; not only our words, but our works [[work]] also, would carry
its brightness and lustre; whatever proceeded from us would be seen
illuminated with this [[noble]] [[light]]. we ought to be ashamed that, in all
the [[human]] sects, there never was any of the faction, that did not, in
some measure, conform his [[life]] and behaviour to it, whereas so divine
and heavenly an institution does only distinguish christians [[christian]] by the
name! will you see the proof of this? compare our manners to those of a
mahometan or pagan, you will still find that we fall very

short; there, where, out of regard to the [[reputation]] and advantage of
our [[religion]], we ought to shine in excellency at a vast distance beyond
all others: and that it should be said of us, “are they so just, so
charitable, so [[good]]: then they are christians [[christian]].” all other signs are
common to all religions [[religion]]; [[hope]], trust, events, ceremonies [[ceremony]], penance,

martyrs. the peculiar mark of our [[truth]] ought to be our [[virtue]], as it
is also the most heavenly and difficult, and the most worthy product
of [[truth]]. for this our [[good]] st. louis was in the [[right]], who, when the
tartar [[king]], who was become [[christian]], designed to come to lyons to kiss
the pope’s feet, and there to be an eye-witness of the [[sanctity]] he hoped
to find in our manner, immediately diverted him from his [[purpose]]; for
fear lest our disorderly way of living should, on the contrary, put
him out of conceit with so holy a belief! and yet it happened quite
otherwise since to that other, who, going to [[rome]], to the same end, and
there seeing the dissoluteness of the prelates and [[people]] of that [[time]],
settled himself so much the more firmly in our [[religion]], considering
how [[great]] the [[force]] and divinity of it must necessarily be that could
maintain its [[dignity]] and splendour among so much [[corruption]], and in so
vicious hands. if we had but one [[single]] grain of [[faith]], we should remove
mountains from their places, saith the [[sacred]] word; our actions, that
would then be directed and accompanied by the divinity, would not be
merely [[human]], they would have in them something of miraculous, as well
as our [[belief]]: _brevis est institutio vitæ honestæ beauæque, si
credos._ “believe, and the way to [[happiness]] and [[virtue]] is a short one.”
 some impose upon the [[world]] that they [[believe]] that which they do not;
others, more in number, make themselves [[believe]] that they [[believe]], not
being able to penetrate into what it is to [[believe]]. we [[think]] it strange
if, in the civil [[war]] which, at this [[time]], disorders our [[state]], we see
events float and vary aller a [[common]] and ordinary manner; which is
because we bring nothing to it but our own. [[justice]], which is in one
party, is only there for ornament and palliation; it, is, indeed,
pretended, but ‘tis not there received, settled and espoused: it is
there, as in the mouth of an advocate, not as in the [[heart]] and affection
of the party. [[god]] owes his extraordinary assistance to [[faith]] and
religion; not to our [[passions]]. [[men]] there are the conductors, and therein
serve themselves with [[religion]], whereas it ought to be quite contrary.
observe, if it be not by our own hands that we guide and train it, and
draw it like wax into so many contrary figures, from a [[rule]] in itself so
direct and firm. when and where was this more manifest than in [[france]] in
our days? they who have taken it on the left hand, they who have taken
it on the [[right]]; they who call it black, they who call it [[white]], alike
employ it to their [[violent]] and ambitious designs, conduct it with
a [[progress]], so conform in riot and [[injustice]] that they render the
diversity they pretended in their opinions [[opinion]], in a thing whereon the
conduct and [[rule]] of our [[life]] depends, doubtful and hard to [[believe]]. did
one ever see, come from the same school and discipline, manners more
united, and more the same? do but observe with what horrid impudence
we toss [[divine]] arguments to and fro, and how irreligiously we have both
rejected and retaken them, accord--as [[fortune]] has shifted our places in
these intestine storms.

this so solemn proposition, “whether it be lawful for a [[subject]] to rebel
and take up arms against his [[prince]] for the defence of his [[religion]],” do
you [[remember]] in whose mouths, the [[last]] year, the affirmative of it
was the prop of one party, and the negative the pillar of another? and
hearken now from what quarter comes the voice and instruction of the
one and the other, and if arms make less noise and rattle for this cause
than for that. we condemn those to the [[fire]] who say that [[truth]] must be
made to bear the yoke of our necessity; and how much worse does france
than say it? let us confess the [[truth]]; whoever should draw out from the
army, even that raised by the [[king]], those who take up arms out of pure
zeal to [[religion]], and also those who only do it to [[protect]] the laws [[law]] of
their [[country]], or for the service of their [[prince]], could hardly, out
of both these put together, make one complete company of gens-d’armes.
whence does this proceed, that there are so few to be found who have
maintained the same will and the same [[progress]] in our civil commotions,
and that we see them one while move but a foot-pace, and another run
full speed? and the same [[men]] one while damage our affairs by their
violent heat and fierceness, and another by their coldness, gentleness,
and slowness; but that they are pushed on by particular and casual
considerations, according to the variety wherein they move?

i evidently perceive that we do not willingly afford devotion any other
offices but those that least suit with our own [[passions]].

there hostility so admirable as the [[christian]]. our zeal performs
wonders, when it seconds our inclinations to [[hatred]], [[cruelty]], [[ambition]],
avarice, detraction, and rebellion: but when it moves, against the hair,
towards bounty, benignity, and temperance, unless, by miracle, some
rare and [[virtuous]] disposition prompts us to it, we stir neither hand nor
toot. our [[religion]] is intended to extirpate vices [[vice]], whereas it screens,
nourishes, and incites them. we must not mock [[god]]. if we believed in
him, i do not say by [[faith]], but with a simple [[belief]], that is to say
(and i speak it to our [[great]] shame) if we believed in him and recognised
him as we do any other [[history]], or as we would do one of our companions,
we should [[love]] him above all other things for the infinite bounty and
beauty that shines in him;--at least, he would go [[equal]] in our affection
with riches [[rich]], [[pleasure]], [[glory]], and our [[friends]]. the [[best]] of us is not so
much afraid to outrage him as he is afraid to injure his neighbour, his
kinsman, or his master. is there any understanding so [[weak]] that, having
on one side the object of one of our vicious pleasures [[pleasure]], and on the other
(in [[equal]] [[knowledge]] and persuasion) the [[state]] of an [[immortal]] [[glory]],
would [[change]] the first for the other? and yet we often renounce this out
of mere contempt: for what [[lust]] tempts us to blaspheme, if not, perhaps,
the very [[desire]] to offend. the philosopher antisthenes, as he was being
initiated in the mysteries of orpheus, the [[priest]] telling him, “that
those who professed themselves of that [[religion]] were [[certain]] to receive
perfect and eternal felicity after [[death]],”--“if thou believest that,”
 answered he, “why dost thou not [[die]] thyself?” diogenes, more rudely,
according to his manner, and more remote from our [[purpose]], to the priest
that in like manner preached to him, “to become of his [[religion]], that he
might obtain the [[happiness]] of the other [[world]];--“what!” said he, “thou
wouldest have me to [[believe]] that agesilaus and epaminondas, who were so
great [[men]], shall be miserable, and that thou, who art [[arts]] but a calf, and
canst do nothing to [[purpose]], shalt be [[happy]], because thou art [[arts]] a [[priest]]?”
 did we receive these [[great]] promises of eternal beatitude with the same
reverence and [[respect]] that we do a philosophical discourse, we should
not have [[death]] in so [[great]] [[horror]]:


   non jam se moriens dissolvi conqurreretur;
   sed magis ire foras, stemque relinquere ut angais,
   gauderet, prealonga senex aut cornua cervus.

   “we should not on a [[death]] bed grieve to be
   dissolved, but rather launch out cheerfully
   from our old hut, and with the snake, be glad
   to cast off the corrupted slough we had;
   or with th’ old stag rejoice to be now clear
   from the large horns, too ponderous grown to bear.”


“i [[desire]] to be dissolved,” we should say, “and to be with [[jesus]] christ”
 the [[force]] of plato’s arguments concerning the immortality of the soul
set some of his disciples to seek a premature grave, that they might the
sooner enjoy the things he had made them [[hope]] for.

all this is a most evident sign that we only receive our religion
after our own [[fashion]], by our own hands, and no otherwise than as other
religions are received. either we are happened in the [[country]] where it
is in practice, or we reverence the antiquity of it, or the authority
of the [[men]] who have maintained it, or [[fear]] the menaces it fulminates
against misbelievers, or are allured by its promises. these
considerations ought, ‘tis true, to be applied to our [[belief]] but as
subsidiaries only, for they are [[human]] obligations. another [[religion]],
other witnesses, the like promises and threats, might, by the same way,
imprint a quite contrary [[belief]]. we are christians [[christian]] by the same title
that we are perigordians or germans. and what [[plato]] says, “that there
are few [[men]] so obstinate in their atheism whom a pressing danger will
not reduce to an acknowledgment of the [[divine]] [[power]],” does not concern
a true [[christian]]: ‘tis for mortal and [[human]] religions [[religion]] to be received by
human recommendation. what [[kind]] of [[faith]] can that be that cowardice and
want of [[courage]] establish in us? a pleasant [[faith]], that does not believe
what it believes [[belief]] but for want of [[courage]] to disbelieve it! can a vicious
passion, such as inconstancy and astonishment, cause any regular product
in our souls [[soul]]? “they are confident in their [[judgment]],” says he, “that
what is said of hell and future torments is all feigned: but an occasion
of making the expedient presenting itself, when old [[age]] or diseases
bring them to the brink of the grave, the terror of [[death]], by the horror
of that future condition, inspires them with a new belief!” and by
reason that such impressions render them timorous, he forbids in his
_laws_ all such threatening doctrines, and all persuasion that anything
of ill can befall a [[man]] from the gods, excepting for his [[great]] [[good]] when
they happen to him, and for a medicinal effect. they say of bion that,
infected with the atheism of theodoras, he had long had [[religious]] [[men]] in
great scorn and contempt, but that [[death]] surprising him, he gave
himself up to the most extreme superstition; as if the gods withdrew and
returned according to the necessities of bion. [[plato]] and these examples
would conclude that we are brought to a [[belief]] of [[god]] either by reason
or by [[force]]. atheism being a proposition as unnatural as monstrous,
difficult also and hard to establish in the [[human]] understanding, how
arrogant soever, there are [[men]] enough seen, out of vanity and [[pride]], to
be the authors of extraordinary and reforming opinions [[opinion]], and outwardly
to affect the profession of them; who, if they are such fools [[fool]], have,
nevertheless, not the [[power]] to plant them in their own [[conscience]]. yet
will they not fail to lift up their hands towards [[heaven]] if you give
them a [[good]] thrust with a [[sword]] in the breast, and when [[fear]] or sickness
has abated and dulled the licentious fury of this giddy [[humour]] they will
easily re-unite, and very discreetly suffer themselves to be reconciled
to the [[public]] [[faith]] and examples [[example]]. a doctrine seriously digested is one
thing, and those superficial impressions another; which springing from
the disorder of an unhinged understanding, float at random and great
uncertainty in the fancy. miserable and senseless [[men]], who strive to be
worse than they can!

the error of paganism and the ignorance of our [[sacred]] [[truth]], let this
great [[soul]] of [[plato]], but [[great]] only in [[human]] greatness, fall also into
this other mistake, “that [[children]] and old [[men]] were most susceptible of
religion,” as if it sprung and derived its credit from our weakness.
the knot that ought to bind the [[judgment]] and the will, that ought to
restrain the [[soul]] and join it to our creator, should be a knot that
derives its foldings and [[strength]] not from our considerations, from our
reasons and [[passions]], but from a [[divine]] and supernatural constraint,
having but one form, one face, and one lustre, which is the authority
of [[god]] and his [[divine]] grace. now the [[heart]] and [[soul]] being governed and
commanded by [[faith]], ‘tis but [[reason]] that they should muster all our
other faculties, according as they are able to perform to the service
and assistance of their design. neither is it to be imagined that all
this machine has not some marks imprinted upon it by the hand of the
mighty architect, and that there is not in the things of this world
some image that in some measure resembles the workman who has built and
formed them. he has, in his stupendous works [[work]], left the [[character]] of his
divinity, and ‘tis our own weakness only that hinders us from discerning
it. ‘tis what he himself is pleased to tell us, “that he manifests his
invisible operations to us by those that are visible.” sebond applied
himself to this laudable and [[noble]] study, and demonstrates to us that
there is not any part or member of the [[world]] that disclaims or derogates
from its maker. it were to do [[wrong]] to the [[divine]] goodness, did not the
universe [[consent]] to our [[belief]]. the heavens [[heaven]], the [[earth]], the elements,
our bodies [[body]] and our souls [[soul]],--all things concur to this; we have but to
find out the way to use them; they instruct us, if we are capable
of instruction. for this [[world]] is a [[sacred]] temple, into which [[man]] is
introduced, there to contemplate statues, not the works [[work]] of a mortal
hand, but such as the [[divine]] [[purpose]] has made the objects of sense; the
sun, the stars, the water, and the [[earth]], to represent those that are
intelligible to us. “the invisible tilings of [[god]],” says st. paul,
“appear by the creation of the [[world]], his eternal [[wisdom]] and divinity
being considered by his works [[work]].”


   and [[god]] himself envies not [[men]] the grace
   of seeing and admiring heaven’s face;
   but, rolling it about, he still anew
   presents [[present]] its varied splendour to our view,
   and on oar minds [[mind]] himself inculcates, so
   that we th’ almighty mover well may [[know]]:
   instructing us by seeing him the cause
   of ill, to revcreoce and obey his laws [[law]].”


now our prayers and [[human]] discourses are but as sterile and undigested
matter. the grace of [[god]] is the form; ‘tis that which gives [[fashion]] and
value to it. as the [[virtuous]] actions of [[socrates]] and cato remain vain
and fruitless, for not having had the [[love]] and [[obedience]] to the true
creator of all things, so is it with our imaginations [[imagination]] and discourses;
they have a [[kind]] of [[body]], but it is an inform mass, without [[fashion]] and
without [[light]], if [[faith]] and grace be not added thereto. [[faith]] coming to
tinct and illustrate sehond’s arguments renders them firm and stolid;
and to that [[degree]] that they are capable of serving for directions, and
of being the first guides to an elementary [[christian]] to put him into the
way of this [[knowledge]]. they in some measure form him to, and render him
capable of, the grace of [[god]], by which means he afterwards completes and
perfects himself in the true [[belief]]. i [[know]] a [[man]] of [[authority]], bred up
to letters, who has confessed to me to have been brought back from the
errors of unbelief by sebond’s arguments. and should they be stripped of
this ornament, and of the assistance and approbation of the [[faith]],
and be looked upon as mere fancies only, to contend with those who are
precipitated into the dreadful and horrible darkness of irréligion, they
will even there find them as solid and firm as any others of the same
quality that can be opposed against them; so that we shall be ready to
say to our opponents:


   si melius quid habes, arcesse; vel imperium fer:

      “if you have arguments more fit.
   [[produce]] them, or to these submit.”


let them admit the [[force]] of our reasons [[reason]], or let them show us others,
and upon some other [[subject]], [[better]] woven and of finer thread. i am,
unawares, half engaged in the second objection, to which i proposed to
make [[answer]] in the behalf of sebond. some say that his arguments are
weak, and unable to make [[good]] what he intends, and undertake with great
ease to confute them. these are to be a little more roughly handled, for
they are more dangerous and malicious than the first [[men]] willingly wrest
the sayings of others to favour their own prejudicate opinions [[opinion]]. to an
atheist all writings tend to atheisïm: he corrupts the most innocent
matter with his own venom. these have their judgments [[judgment]] so prepossessed
that they cannot relish sebond’s reasons [[reason]]. as to the rest, they [[think]] we
give them very [[fair]] play in putting them into the [[liberty]] of combatting
our [[religion]] with [[weapons]] merely [[human]], whom, in her majesty, full of
authority and command, they durst not attack. the means that i shall
use, and that i [[think]] most proper to subdue this frenzy, is to crush and
spurn under foot [[pride]] and [[human]] arrogance; to make them sensible of
the inanity, vanity, and vileness of [[man]]; to wrest the wretched arms
of their [[reason]] out of their hands; to make them bow down and bite the
ground under the [[authority]] and reverence of the [[divine]] majesty. ‘tis to
that alone that [[knowledge]] and [[wisdom]] appertain; that alone that can make
a true estimate of itself, and from which we purloin whatever we value
ourselves upon: [--greek--] “god permits not any being but himself to be
truly [[wise]].” let us subdue this presumption, the first foundation of the
tyranny of the [[evil]] spirit _deus superbis re-sistit, humilibus autem
dal gratiam._ “god resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”
 “understanding is in the gods,” says [[plato]], “and not at all, or very
little, in [[men]].” now it is in the mean [[time]] a [[great]] consolation to a
christian [[man]] to see our frail and mortal parts so fitly suited to our
holy and [[divine]] [[faith]] that, when we employ them to the subjects [[subject]] of their
own mortal and frail [[nature]] they are not even there more unitedly or
more firmly adjusted. let us see, then, if [[man]] has in his [[power]] other
more forcible and convincing reasons [[reason]] than those of sebond; that is to
say, if it be in him to arrive at any certainty by argument and [[reason]].
for st. augustin, disputing against these [[people]], has [[good]] cause to
reproach them with [[injustice]], “in that they maintain the part of our
belief to be false that our [[reason]] cannot establish.” and to show that
a [[great]] many things may be, and have been, of which our [[nature]] could
not sound the [[reason]] and causes, he proposes to them [[certain]] known and
undoubted experiments, wherein [[men]] confess they see nothing; and this he
does, as all other things, with a [[curious]] and ingenious inquisition.
we must do more than this, and make them [[know]] that, to convince the
weakness of their [[reason]], there is no necessity of culling out uncommon
examples: and that it is so defective and so blind that there is no
faculty clear enough for it; that to it the easy and the hard are all
one; that all subjects [[subject]] equally, and [[nature]] in general, disclaim its
authority and reject its mediation.

what does [[truth]] mean when she preaches to us to fly worldly [[philosophy]],
when she so often inculcates to us, “that our [[wisdom]] is but folly in the
sight of [[god]]: that the vainest of all vanities is [[man]]: that the [[man]] who
presumes upon his [[wisdom]] does not yet [[know]] what [[wisdom]] is; and that [[man]],
who is nothing, if he thinks [[think]] himself to be anything, does seduce and
deceive himself.” these sentences of the holy spirit do so clearly and
vividly express that which i would maintain that i should need no other
proof against [[men]] who would with all [[humility]] and [[obedience]] submit to
his [[authority]]: but these will be whipped at their own expense, and will
not suffer a [[man]] to oppose their [[reason]] but by itself.

let us then, for once, consider a [[man]] alone, without [[foreign]] assistance,
armed only with his own proper arms, and unfurnished of the [[divine]] grace
and [[wisdom]], which is all his [[honour]], [[strength]], and the foundation of his
being. let us see how he stands in this fine equipage. let him make me
understand, by the [[force]] of his [[reason]], upon what foundations he has
built those [[great]] advantages he thinks [[think]] he has over other creatures. who
has made him [[believe]] that this admirable motion of the celestial arch,
the eternal [[light]] of those luminaries that roll so high over his head,
the wondrous and fearful motions of that infinite ocean, should be
established and continue so many ages [[age]] for his service and convenience?
can any thing be imagined so ridiculous, that this miserable and
wretched creature, who is not so much as master of himself, but subject
to the injuries of all things, should call himself master and [[emperor]] of
the [[world]], of which he has not [[power]] to [[know]] the least part, much less
to command the whole? and the [[privilege]] which he attributes to himself
of being the only creature in this vast fabric who has the understanding
to discover the [[beauty]] and the [[paris]] of it; the only one who can
return thanks to the architect, and keep account of the revenues [[revenue]] and
disbursements of the [[world]]; who, i wonder, sealed him this patent? let
us see his commission for this [[great]] employment was it granted in favour
of the [[wise]] only? few [[people]] will be concerned in it. are fools [[fool]] and
wicked persons [[person]] worthy so extraordinary a favour, and, being the worst
part of the [[world]], to be preferred before the rest? shall we believe
this [[man]]?--“for whose sake shall we, therefore, conclude that the world
was made? for theirs who have the use of [[reason]]: these are gods and [[men]],
than whom certainly nothing can be [[better]]:” we can never sufficiently
decry the impudence of this conjunction. but, wretched creature,
what has he in himself worthy of such an advantage? considering the
incorruptible existence of the celestial bodies [[body]]; [[beauty]]; magnitude, and
continual [[revolution]] by so exact a [[rule]];


      cum suspicimus mæni cælestia mundi
   templa super, stellisque micantibus arthera fiium,
   el venit in mcntem lunæ solisque viarurn.

      “when we the heavenly arch above behold.
   and the vast [[sky]] adorned with stars of gold.
   and mark the r’eglar course? that the sun
   and moon in their alternate [[progress]] run.”


considering the dominion and influence those bodies [[body]] have, not only over
our lives [[life]] and fortunes [[fortune]];


   facta etenim et vitas hominum suspendit ab aatris;

   “men’s lives [[life]] and actions on the stars depend.”


but even over our inclinations, our thoughts [[thought]] and wills, which they
govern, incite and agitate at the [[mercy]] of their influences, as our
reason teaches [[teach]] us;


      “contemplating the stars he finds that they
   [[rule]] by a secret and a silent sway;
   and that the enamell’d spheres which roll above
   do ever by alternate causes move.
   and, studying these, he can also foresee,
   by [[certain]] signs, the turns of [[destiny]];”


seeing that not only a [[man]], not only kings [[king]], but that monarchies [[monarchy]],
empires, and all this lower [[world]] [[follow]] the influence of the celestial
motions,


      “how [[great]] a [[change]] a little motion brings!
   so [[great]] this [[kingdom]] is that governs kings [[king]]:”


if our [[virtue]], our vices [[vice]], our [[knowledge]], and this very discourse we are
upon of the [[power]] of the stars, and the comparison we are making betwixt
them and us, proceed, as our [[reason]] supposes, from their favour;


      “one mad in [[love]] may cross the raging main,
   to level lofty ilium with the plain;
   another’s [[fate]] inclines him more by far
   to study laws [[law]] and statutes for the bar.
   sons [[son]] kill their [[father]], fathers [[father]] kill their sons [[son]],
   and one arm’d [[brother]] ‘gainst another runs..
   this war’s not their’s, but fate’s, that spurs them on
   to shed the [[blood]] which, shed, they must bemoan;
   and i ascribe it to the will of fate
   that on this theme i now expatiate:”


if we derive this little portion of [[reason]] we have from the bounty of
heaven, how is it possible that [[reason]] should ever make us [[equal]] to it?
how [[subject]] its essence and condition to our [[knowledge]]? whatever we see
in those bodies [[body]] astonishes us: _quæ molitio, qua ferramenta, qui vectes,
quæ machina, qui ministri tanti operis fuerunt?_ “what contrivance, what
tools, what materials, what engines, were employed about so stupendous
a [[work]]?” why do we deprive them of [[soul]], of [[life]], and discourse? have we
discovered in them any immoveable or insensible stupidity, we who
have no commerce with them but by [[obedience]]? shall we say that we have
discovered in no other creature but [[man]] the use of a reasonable [[soul]]?
what! have we seen any thing like the sun? does he cease to be, because
we have seen nothing like him? and do his motions cease, because there
are no other like them? if what we have not seen is not, our knowledge
is marvellously contracted: _quæ sunt tantæ animi angustiæ!_ “how narrow
are our understandings!” are they not dreams [[dream]] of [[human]] vanity, to make
the moon a celestial [[earth]]? there to fancy mountains and vales, as
anaxagoras did? there to fix habitations and [[human]] abodes, and plant
colonies for our convenience, as [[plato]] and plutarch have done? and of
our [[earth]] to make a luminous and resplendent star? “amongst the
other inconveniences of [[mortality]] this is one, that darkness of the
understanding which leads [[men]] astray, not so much from a necessity of
erring, but from a [[love]] of error. the corruptible [[body]] stupifies
the [[soul]], and the earthly habitation dulls the faculties of the
imagination.”

presumption is our [[natural]] and original disease. the most wretched and
frail of all creatures is [[man]], and withal the proudest. he feels [[feel]] and
sees himself lodged here in the dirt and filth of the [[world]], nailed and
rivetted to the worst and deadest part of the [[universe]], in the lowest
story of the house, the most remote from the heavenly arch, with animals
of the worst condition of the three; and yet in his [[imagination]] will be
placing himself above the circle of the moon, and bringing the heavens
under his feet. ‘tis by the same vanity of [[imagination]] that he equals
himself to [[god]], attributes to himself [[divine]] qualities, withdraws and
separates himself from the the crowd of other creatures, cuts out the
shares of the animals, his fellows and companions, and distributes to
them portions of faculties and [[force]], as himself thinks [[think]] fit how does
he [[know]], by the [[strength]] of his understanding, the secret and internal
motions of animals?--from what comparison betwixt them and us does he
conclude the stupidity he attributes to them? when i play with my cat
who knows [[know]] whether i do not make her more [[sport]] than she makes me? we
mutually divert one another with our play. if i have my hour to begin
or to refusç, she also has hers. [[plato]], in his picture of the golden age
under saturn, reckons, among the [[chief]] advantages that a [[man]] then had,
his communication with beasts, of whom, inquiring and informing himself,
he knew the true qualities and differences of them all, by which he
acquired a very [[perfect]] [[intelligence]] and prudence, and [[led]] his life
more happily than we could do. need we a [[better]] proof to condemn human
impudence in the concern of beasts? this [[great]] author was of opinion
that [[nature]], for the most part in the corporal form she gave them, had
only regard to the use of prognostics that were derived thence in his
time. the defect that hinders communication betwixt them and us, why may
it not be in our part as well as theirs? ‘tis yet to determine where the
fault lies [[lie]] that we [[understand]] not one another,--for we [[understand]] them
no more than they do us; and by the same [[reason]] they may [[think]] us to be
beasts as we [[think]] them. ‘tis no [[great]] wonder if we [[understand]] not them,
when we do not [[understand]] a basque or a troglodyte. and yet some have
boasted that they understood them, as apollonius tyanaus, melampus,
tiresias, thales, and others. and seeing, as cusmographers report, that
there are nations that have a dog for their [[king]], they must of necessity
be able to interpret his voice and motions. we must observe the parity
betwixt us, have some tolerable apprehension of their meaning, and so
have beasts of ours,--much about the same. they caress us, threaten us,
and beg of us, and we do the same to them.

as to the rest, we manifestly discover that they have a full and
absolute communication amongst themselves, and that they perfectly
understand one another, not only those of the same, but of divers kinds [[kind]]:


      “the tamer herds, and wilder sort of brutes.
   though we of higher [[race]] conclude them mutes.
   yet utter dissonant and various notes,
   from gentler lungs or more distended throats,
   as [[fear]], or [[grief]], or anger, do them move,
   or as they do approach the joys of [[love]].”


in one [[kind]] of barking of a dog the horse knows [[know]] there is anger, of
another sort of bark he is not afraid. even in the very beasts that
have no voice at all, we easily conclude, from the [[society]] of offices
we observe amongst them, some other sort of communication: their very
motions discover it:


      “as infants who, for want of words, devise
   expressive motions with their hands and [[eyes]].”


and why not, as well as our dumb [[people]], dispute, argue, and tell
stories by signs? of whom i have seen some, by practice, so clever and
active that way that, in [[fact]], they wanted nothing of the perfection
of making themselves understood. lovers are angry, reconciled, intreat,
thank, appoint, and, in short, speak all things by their [[eyes]]:


      “even [[silence]] in a lover
   [[love]] and passion can discover.”


what with the hands? we require, promise, call, dismiss, threaten, [[pray]],
supplicate, deny, refuse, interrogate, [[admire]], number, confess, repent,
fear, express confusion, [[doubt]], instruct, command, incite, encourage,
swear, testify, accuse, condemn, absolve, [[abuse]], despise, defy, provoke,
flatter, applaud, bless, submit, mock, reconcile, recommend, exalt,
entertain, congratulate, [[complain]], grieve, despair, wonder, exclaim, and
what not! and all this with a variety and multiplication, even emulating
speech. with the head we invite, remand, confess, deny, give the [[lie]],
welcome, [[honour]], reverence, disdain, demand, rejoice, lament, reject,
caress, rebuke, submit, huff, encourage, threaten, assure, and inquire.
what with the eyebrows?--what with the shoulders! there is not a motion
that does not speak, and in an intelligible [[language]] without discipline,
and a [[public]] [[language]] that every one understands: whence it should
follow, the variety and use distinguished from others considered, that
these should rather be judged the [[property]] of [[human]] [[nature]]. i omit
what necessity particularly does suddenly suggest to those who are in
need;--the alphabets upon the fingers, grammars in gesture, and the
sciences which are only by them exercised and expressed; and the nations
that pliny reports have no other [[language]]. an ambassador of the [[city]] of
abdera, after a long conference with agis, [[king]] of sparta, demanded of
him, “well, sir, what [[answer]] must i return to my fellow-citizens?” “that
i have given thee leave,” said he, “to say what thou wouldest, and as
much as thou wouldest, without ever speaking a word.” is not this a
silent speaking, and very easy to be understood?

as to the rest, what is there in us that we do not see in the operations
of animals? is there a polity [[better]] ordered, the offices better
distributed, and more inviolably observed and maintained, than that
of bees? can we imagine that such, and so regular, a distribution of
employments can be carried on without reasoning and deliberation?


      “hence to the bee some sages have assign’d
   some portion of the [[god]] and heavenly wind.”


the swallows that we see at the return of the spring, searching all the
corners of our houses for the most commodious places wherein to build
their nest; do they seek without [[judgment]], and amongst a thousand choose
out the most proper for their [[purpose]], without discretion? and in that
elegant and admirable contexture of their buildings, can birds rather
make [[choice]] of a square figure than a round, of an obtuse than of a
right angle, without knowing their properties [[property]] and effects? do they bring
water, and then clay, without knowing that the hardness of the latter
grows softer by being wetted? do they mat their palace with moss or down
without foreseeing that their tender [[young]] will [[lie]] more safe and easy?
do they secure themselves from the wet and rainy winds, and place their
lodgings against the east, without knowing the different qualities of
the winds, and considering that one is more wholesome than another?
why does the spider make her web tighter in one place, and slacker in
another; why now make one sort of knot, and then another, if she has not
deliberation, [[thought]], and conclusion? we sufficiently discover in most
of their works [[work]] how much animals excel us, and how unable our art [[arts]] is to
imitate them. we see, nevertheless, in our rougher performances, that we
employ all our faculties, and apply the utmost [[power]] of our souls [[soul]]; why
do we not conclude the same of them?

why should we attribute to i [[know]] not what [[natural]] and servile
inclination the works [[work]] that excel all we can do by [[nature]] and art [[arts]]?
wherein, without being aware, we give them a mighty advantage over us
in making [[nature]], with maternal gentleness and [[love]], accompany and learn
them, as it were, by the hand to all the actions and commodities of
their [[life]], whilst she leaves us to [[chance]] and [[fortune]], and to seek out
by art [[arts]] the things that are necessary to our conservation, at the same
time denying us the means of being able, by any instruction or effort of
understanding, to arrive at the [[natural]] sufficiency of beasts; so that
their brutish stupidity surpasses, in all conveniences, all that our
divine [[intelligence]] can do. really, at this rate, we might with great
reason call her an [[unjust]] stepmother: but it is nothing so, our polity
is not so irregular and unformed.

nature has universally cared for all her creatures, and there is not
one she has not amply furnished with all means necessary for the
conservation of its being. for the [[common]] complaints i hear [[men]] make (as
the license of their opinions [[opinion]] one while lifts them up above the clouds,
and then again depresses them to the antipodes), that we are the only
animal abandoned naked upon the bare [[earth]], tied and bound, not having
wherewithal to arm and clothe us but by the spoil of others; whereas
nature has covered all other creatures either with shells, husks,
bark, hair, wool, prickles, leather, down, feathers, scales, or silk,
according to the necessities of their being; has armed them with talons,
teeth, or horns, wherewith to assault and defend, and has herself taught
them that which is most proper for them, to swim, to run, to fly, and
sing, whereas [[man]] neither knows [[know]] how to walk, speak, [[eat]], or do any thing
but weep, without teaching;


      “like to the wretched mariner, when toss’d
   by raging seas upon the desert coast,
   the tender babe lies [[lie]] naked on the [[earth]],
   of all supports of [[life]] stript by his birth;
   when [[nature]] first presents [[present]] him to the day,
   freed from the cell wherein before he lay,
   he fills the ambient air with doleful cries.
   foretelling thus life’s future miseries;
   but beasts, both wild and tame, greater and less,
   do of themselves in [[strength]] and bulk increase;
   they need no rattle, nor the broken chat,
   ay which the nurse first teaches [[teach]] boys to prate
   they look not out for different robes to wear,
   according to the seasons of the year;
   and need no arms nor walls their goods [[good]] to save,
   since [[earth]] and liberal [[nature]] ever have,
   and will, in all abundance, still produce
   all things whereof they can have need or use:”


these complaints are false; there is in the polity of the [[world]] a
greater equality and more uniform relation. our skins are as sufficient
to defend us from the injuries of the weather as theirs are; witness
several nations that yet [[know]] not the use of clothes. our ancient gauls
were but slenderly clad, any more than the irish, our neighbours, though
in so cold a [[climate]]; but we may [[better]] [[judge]] of this by ourselves: for
all those parts that we are pleased to expose to the air are found very
able to endure it: the face, the feet, the hands, the arms, the head,
according to the various habit; if there be a tender part about us,
and that would seem to be in danger from cold, it should be the stomach
where the digestion is; and yet our forefathers were there always
open, and our ladies [[lady]], as tender and delicate as they are, go sometimes
half-bare as low as the navel. neither is the binding or swathing of
infants any more necessary; and the lacedæmoman mothers [[mother]] brought theirs
in all [[liberty]] of motion of members, without any ligature at all. our
crying is [[common]] with the [[greatest]] part of other animals, and there are
but few creatures that are not observed to groan, and bemoan themselves
a long [[time]] after they come into the [[world]]; forasmuch as it is a
behaviour suitable to the weakness wherein they find themselves. as
to the custom of eating, it is in us, as in them, [[natural]], and without
instruction;


      “for every one soon finds his [[natural]] [[force]].
   which he, or [[better]] may employ, or worse.”


who doubts [[doubt]] but an infant, arrived to the [[strength]] of feeding himself,
may make shift to find something to [[eat]] and the [[earth]] produces [[produce]] and
offers him wherewithal to supply his necessity, without other culture
and artifice; and if not at all times [[time]], no more does she do it to beasts,
witness the provision we see ants and other creatures hoard up against
the [[dead]] seasons of the year. the late discovered nations, so abundantly
furnished with [[natural]] meat and drink, without [[care]], or without cookery,
may give us to [[understand]] that bread is not our only food, and that,
without tillage, our [[mother]] [[nature]] has provided us sufficiently of all
we stand in need of: nay, it appears more fully and plentifully than she
does at [[present]], now that we have added our own industry:


      “the [[earth]] did first spontaneously afford
   [[choice]] fruits and wines to furnish out the board;
   with herbs and flow’rs unsown in verdant fields.
   but scarce by art [[arts]] so [[good]] a harvest yields;
   though [[men]] and oxen mutually have strove,
   with all their utmost [[force]] the soil t’ improve,”


the debauchery and irregularity of our appetites outstrips all the
inventions we can contrive to satisfy it.

as to arms, we have more [[natural]] ones than than most other animals more
various motions of limbs, and naturally and without lesson extract more
service from them. those that are trained to [[fight]] naked are seen
to throw themselves into the like hazards that we do. if some beasts
surpass us in this advantage, we surpass many others. and the industry
of fortifying the [[body]], and covering it by acquired means, we have by
instinct and [[natural]] precept? that it is so, the elephant shows
who sharpen, and whets the teeth he makes use of in [[war]] (for he has
particular ones for that service, which he spares, and never employs
them at all to any other use); when bulls go to [[fight]], they toss and
throw the dust about them; boars whet their tusks; and the ichneumon,
when he is about to engage with the crocodile, fortifies his [[body]],
and covers and crusts it all over with close-wrought and well-tempered
slime, as with a cuirass. why shall we not say that it is also natural
for us to arm ourselves with wood and iron?

as to [[speech]], it is [[certain]] that if it be not [[natural]] it is not
necessary. nevertheless i [[believe]] that a child which had been brought up
in an absolute solitude, remote from all [[society]] of [[men]] (which would
be an experiment very hard to make), would have some [[kind]] of [[speech]] to
express his meaning by. and ‘tis not to be supposed that [[nature]] should
have denied that to us which she has given to several other animals:
for what is this faculty we observe in them, of complaining, rejoicing,
calling to one another for succour, and inviting each other to [[love]],
which they do with the voice, other than [[speech]]? and why should they
not speak to one another? they speak to us, and we to them. in how many
several sorts of ways do we speak to our dogs, and they [[answer]] us?
we converse with them in another sort of [[language]], and use other
appellations, than we do with birds, hogs, oxen, horses, and alter the
idiom according to the [[kind]].


      “thus from one swarm of ants some sally out.
   to spy another’s stock or mark its rout.”


lactantius seems to attribute to beasts not only [[speech]], but laughter
also. and the difference of [[language]] which is seen amongst us, according
to the difference of countries [[country]], is also observed in animals of the
same [[kind]]. [[aristotle]], in proof of this, instances the various calls of
partridges, according to the situation of places:


      “and various birds do from their warbling throats
   at various times [[time]], utter quite different notes,
   and some their hoarse songs [[song]] with the seasons [[change]].”


but it is yet to be known what [[language]] this child would speak; and of
that what is said by guess has no [[great]] appearance. if a [[man]] will allege
to me, in opposition to this [[opinion]], that those who are naturally deaf
speak not, i [[answer]] that this is not only because they could not receive
the instruction of speaking by ear, but rather because the sense of
hearing, of which they are deprived, relates to that of speaking, and
that these hold together by a [[natural]] and inseparable tie, in such
manner that what we speak we must first speak to ourselves within, and
make it sound in our own ears, before we can utter it to others.

all this i have said to prove the resemblance there is in [[human]] things,
and to bring us back and join us to the crowd. we are neither above nor
below the rest all that is under [[heaven]], says the sage, runs one [[law]] and
one [[fortune]]:


      “all things remain
   bound and entangled in one fatal chain.”


there is, indeed, some difference,--there are several orders and
degrees; but it is under the aspect of one and the same [[nature]]:


      “all things by their own rites proceed, and draw
   towards their ends, by nature’s [[certain]] [[law]].”


man must be compelled and restrained within the bounds of this polity.
miserable creature! he is not in a condition really to step over the
rail. he is fettered and circumscribed, he is subjected to the same
necessity that the other creatures of his rank and order are, and of
a very mean condition, without any prerogative of true and real
pre-eminence. that which he attributes to himself, by [[vain]] fancy and
opinion, has neither [[body]] nor taste. and if it be so, that he only, of
all the animals, has this [[liberty]] of [[imagination]] and irregularity of
thoughts, representing to him that which is, that which is not, and that
he would have, the false and the true, ‘tis an advantage dearly bought,
and of which he has very little [[reason]] to be proud; for thence springs
the principal and original fountain of all the evils [[evil]] that befal
him,--sin, sickness, irresolution, affliction, despair. i say, then,
to return to my [[subject]], that there is no appearance to induce a [[man]] to
believe that beasts should, by a [[natural]] and forced inclination, do the
same things that we do by our [[choice]] and industry. we ought from like
effects to conclude like faculties, and from greater effects greater
faculties; and consequently confess that the same reasoning, and the
same ways by which we operate, are [[common]] with them, or that they have
others that are [[better]]. why should we imagine this [[natural]] constraint in
them, who [[experience]] no such effect in ourselves? added that it is more
honourable to be guided and obliged to act regularly by a [[natural]] and
inevitable condition, and nearer allied to the divinity, than to act
regularly by a temerarious and fortuitous [[liberty]], and more safe to
entrust the reins of our conduct in the hands of [[nature]] than our
own. the vanity of our presumption makes us prefer rather to owe our
sufficiency to our own exertions than to her bounty, and to enrich the
other animals with [[natural]] goods [[good]], and abjure them in their favour,
in order to [[honour]] and ennoble ourselves with goods [[good]] acquired, very
foolishly in my [[opinion]]; for i should as much value parts and virtues
naturally and purely my own as those i had begged and obtained from
education. it is not in our [[power]] to obtain a nobler [[reputation]] than to
be favoured of [[god]] and [[nature]].

for instance, take the fox, the [[people]] of thrace make use of when they
wish to pass over the ice of some frozen river, and turn him out before
them to that [[purpose]]; when we see him lay his ear upon the bank of
the river, down to the ice, to listen if from a more remote or nearer
distance he can hear the noise of the waters’ current, and, according as
he finds by that the ice to be of a less or greater thickness, to retire
or advance,--have we not [[reason]] to [[believe]] thence that the same rational
thoughts passed through his head that we should have upon the like
occasions; and that it is a ratiocination and consequence, drawn from
natural sense, that that which makes a noise runs, that which runs
is not frozen, what is not frozen is liquid, and that which is liquid
yields to impression! for to attribute this to a mere quickness of the
sense of hearing, without [[reason]] and consequence, is a chimæra that
cannot enter into the [[imagination]]. we are to suppose the same of
the many sorts of subtleties and inventions with which beasts secure
themselves from, and frustrate, the enterprizes we plot against them.

and if we will make an advantage even of this, that it is in our power
to seize them, to employ them in our service, and to use them at our
pleasure, ‘tis still but the same advantage we have over one another. we
have our slaves [[slave]] upon these terms: the climacidæ, were they not women
in syria who, squat on all fours, served for a ladder or footstool, by
which the ladies [[lady]] mounted their coaches? and the [[greatest]] part of free
persons [[surrender]], for very trivial conveniences, their [[life]] and being
into the [[power]] of another. the wives [[wife]] and concubines of the thracians
contended who should be chosen to be slain upon their husband’s tomb.
have tyrants [[tyrant]] ever failed of finding [[men]] enough vowed to their devotion?
some of them moreover adding this necessity, of accompanying them in
death as well as [[life]]? whole armies [[army]] have bound themselves after this
manner to their captains. the form of the oath in the rude school of
gladiators was in these words: “we swear to suffer ourselves to be
chained, burnt, wounded, and killed with the [[sword]], and to endure all
that true gladiators suffer from their master, religiously engaging both
body and [[soul]] in his service.”


      uire meum, si vis, flamma caput, et pete ferro
   corpus, et iutorto verbere terga seca.

      “wound me with steel, or burn my head with [[fire]].
   or scourge my shoulders with well-twisted wire.”


this was an obligation indeed, and yet there, in one year, ten thousand
entered into it, to their destruction. when the scythians interred their
king they strangled upon his [[body]] the most beloved of his concubines,
his cup-bearer, the master of his horse, his chamberlain, the usher of
his chamber, and his cook. and upon the anniversary thereof they killed
fifty horses, mounted by fifty pages, that they had impaled all up the
spine of the back to the throat, and there left them fixed in triumph
about his tomb. the [[men]] that serve us do it cheaper, and for a less
careful and favourable usage than what we treat our hawks, horses and
dogs withal. to what solicitude do we not submit for the conveniences of
these? i do not [[think]] that servants of the most abject condition would
willingly do that for their masters that princes [[prince]] [[think]] it an [[honour]] to
do for their beasts. diogenes seeing his relations solicitous to redeem,
him from servitude: “they are fools [[fool]],” said he; “‘tis he that keeps and
nourishes me that in reality serves me.” and they who entertain beasts
ought rather to be said to serve them, than to be served by them. and
withal in this these have something more generous in that one lion
never submitted to another lion, nor one horse to another, for want of
courage. as we go to the chase of beasts, so do tigers and lions to
the chase of [[men]], and do the same execution upon one another; dogs upon
hares, pikes upon tench, swallows upon grass-hoppers, and sparrow-hawks
upon blackbirds and larks:


      “the stork with snakes and lizards from the wood
   and pathless wilds supports her callow brood,
   while jove’s own eagle, bird of [[noble]] [[blood]],
   scours the wide [[country]] for undaunted food;
   sweeps the swift hare or swifter fawn away,
   and feeds her nestlings with the generous prey.”


we divide the quarry, as well as the pains [[pain]] and [[labour]] of the chase, with
our hawks and hounds. and about amphipolis, in thrace, the hawkers and
wild falcons equally divide the prey in the half. as also along the lake
mæotis, if the fisherman does not honestly leave the wolves an equal
share of what he has caught, they presently go and tear his nets in
pieces. and as we have a way of sporting that is carried on more by
subtlety than [[force]], as springing hares, and angling with line and hook,
there is also the like amongst other animals. [[aristotle]] says that the
cuttle-fish casts a gut out of her throat as long as a line, which she
extends and draws back at [[pleasure]]; and as she perceives some little
fish approach her she lets it nibble upon the end of this gut, lying
herself concealed in the sand or mud, and by little and little draws it
in, till the little fish is so near her that at one spring she may catch
it.

as to [[strength]], there is no creature in the [[world]] exposed to so many
injuries as [[man]]. we need not a whale, elephant, or a crocodile, nor any
such-like animals, of which one alone is sufficient to dispatch a great
number of [[men]], to do our [[business]]; lice are sufficient to vacate sylla’s
dictatorship; and the [[heart]] and [[life]] of a [[great]] and triumphant emperor
is the breakfast of a little contemptible worm!

why should we say that it is only for [[man]], or [[knowledge]] built up by
art and meditation, to distinguish the things useful for his being, and
proper for the cure of his diseases, and those which are not; to know
the virtues [[virtue]] of rhubarb and polypody. when we see the goats of candia,
when wounded with an arrow, among a million of plants choose out
dittany for their cure; and the tortoise, when she has eaten a viper,
immediately go out to look for origanum to purge her; the dragon to rub
and clear his [[eyes]] with fennel; the storks to give themselves clysters
of sea-water; the elephants to draw not only out of their own bodies [[body]],
and those of their companions, but out of the bodies [[body]] of their masters
too (witness the elephant of [[king]] porus whom alexander defeated), the
darts and javelins thrown at them in [[battle]], and that so dexterously
that we ourselves could not do it with so little [[pain]] to the
patient;--why do we not say here also that this is [[knowledge]] and [[reason]]?
for to allege, to their disparagement, that ‘tis by the sole instruction
and dictate of [[nature]] that they [[know]] all this, is not to take from them
the [[dignity]] of [[knowledge]] and [[reason]], but with greater [[force]] to attribute
it to them than to us, for the [[honour]] of so infallible a mistress.
chrysippus, though in other things as scornful a [[judge]] of the condition
of animals as any other philosopher whatever, considering the motions of
a dog, who coming to a place where three ways met, either to hunt after
his master he has lost, or in pursuit of some game that flies before
him, goes snuffing first in one of the ways, and then in another, and,
after having made himself sure of two, without finding the trace of
what he seeks, dashes into the third without examination, is forced to
confess that this reasoning is in the dog: “i have traced my master to
this place; he must of necessity be gone one of these three ways; he is
not gone this way nor that, he must then infallibly be gone this other;”
 and that assuring himself by this conclusion, he makes no use of his
nose in the third way, nor ever lays it to the ground, but suffers
himself to be carried on there bv the [[force]] of [[reason]]. this sally,
purely logical, and this use of propositions divided and conjoined, and
the [[right]] enumeration of parts, is it not every whit as [[good]] that the
dog knows [[know]] all this of himself as well as from trapezuntius?

animals are not incapable, however, of being instructed after our
method. we [[teach]] blackbirds, ravens, pies, and parrots, to speak: and
the facility wherewith we see they lend us their voices, and render both
them and their breath so supple and pliant, to be formed and confined
within a [[certain]] number of letters and syllables, does evince that they
have a [[reason]] within, which renders them so docile and willing to learn.
everybody, i [[believe]], is glutted with the several sorts of tricks that
tumblers [[teach]] their dogs; the dances, where they do not miss any one
cadence of the sound they hear; the several various motions and leaps
they make them perform by the command of a word. but i observe this
effect with the [[greatest]] admiration, which nevertheless is very [[common]],
in the dogs that lead the blind, both in the [[country]] and in cities [[city]]: i
have taken notice how they stop at [[certain]] doors, where they are wont
to receive alms; how they avoid the encounter of coaches and carts, even
there where they have sufficient room to pass; i have seen them, by the
trench of a town, forsake a plain and even path and take a worse, only
to keep their masters further from the ditch;--how could a [[man]] have
made this dog [[understand]] that it was his office to look to his master’s
safely only, and to despise his own conveniency to serve him? and how
had he the [[knowledge]] that a way was wide enough for him that was not so
for a blind [[man]]? can all this be apprehended without ratiocination!

i must not omit what plutarch says he saw of a dog at [[rome]] with the
emperor vespasian, the [[father]], at the theatre of marcellus. this dog
served a player, that played a farce of several parts and personages,
and had therein his part. he had, amongst other things, to counterfeit
himself for some [[time]] [[dead]], by [[reason]] of a [[certain]] drug he was supposed
to [[eat]] after he had swallowed a piece of bread, which passed for the
drug, he began after awhile to tremble and stagger, as if he was taken
giddy: at [[last]], stretching himself out stiff, as if [[dead]], he suffered
himself to be drawn and dragged from place to place, as it was his part
to do; and afterward, when he knew it to be [[time]], he began first gently
to stir, as if awaking out of a profound sleep, and lifting up his head
looked about him after such a manner as astonished all the spectators.

the oxen that served in the [[royal]] gardens of susa, to water them, and
turn [[certain]] [[great]] wheels to draw water for that [[purpose]], to which
buckets were fastened (such as there are many in languedoc), being
ordered every one to draw a hundred turns a day, they were so accustomed
to this number that it was impossible by any [[force]] to make them draw one
turn more; but, their task being performed, they would suddenly stop and
stand still. we are almost [[men]] before we can count a hundred, and have
lately discovered nations that have no [[knowledge]] of numbers at all.

there is more understanding required in the teaching of’ others than in
being taught. now, setting aside what democritus held and proved, “that
most of the [[arts]] we have were taught us by other animals,” as by the
spider to weave and sew; by the swallow to build; by the swan and
nightingale [[music]]; and by several animals to make medicines:--aristotle
is of [[opinion]] “that the nightingales [[teach]] their [[young]] ones to sing, and
spend a [[great]] deal of [[time]] and [[care]] in it;” whence it happens that those
we bring up in cages, and which have not had the [[time]] to learn of their
parents, want much of the grace of their singing: we may [[judge]] by this
that they improve by discipline and study; and, even amongst the wild,
it is not all and every one alike--every one has learnt to do better
or worse, according to their capacity. and so [[jealous]] are they one of
another, whilst learning, that they contention with emulation, and by
so vigorous a contention that sometimes the vanquished fall [[dead]] upon the
place, the breath rather failing than the voice. the younger ruminate
pensively and begin to mutter some broken notes; the disciple listens
to the master’s lesson, and gives the [[best]] account he is able; they
are silent oy turns; one may hear faults [[fault]] corrected and observe some
reprehensions of the teacher. “ï have formerly seen,” says arrian, “an
elephant having a cymbal hung at each leg, and another fastened to his
trunk, at the sound of which all the others danced round about him,
rising and bending at [[certain]] cadences, as they were guided by
the instrument; and ‘twas delightful to hear this harmony.” in the
spectacles of [[rome]] there were ordinarily seen elephants taught to move
and dance to the sound of the voice, dances wherein were several changes
and cadences very hard to learn. and some have been known so intent upon
their lesson as privately to practice it by themselves, that they might
not be chidden nor beaten by their masters.

but this other story of the pie, of which we have plutarch himself for a
warrant, is very [[strange]]. she lived in a barber’s shop at [[rome]], and did
wonders in imitating with her voice whatever she heard. it happened one
day that [[certain]] trumpeters stood a [[good]] while sounding before the
shop. after that, and all the next day, the pie was pensive, dumb, and
melancholic; which every [[body]] wondered at, and [[thought]] the noise of the
trumpets had so stupified and astonished her that her voice was
gone with her hearing. but they found at [[last]] that it was a profound
meditation and a retiring into herself, her thoughts [[thought]] exercising and
preparing her voice to imitate the sound of those trumpets, so that the
first voice she uttered was perfectly to imitate their strains, stops,
and changes [[change]]; having by this new lesson quitted and taken in disdain all
she had learned before.

i will not omit this other [[example]] of a dog, also, which the same
plutarch (i am sadly confounding all order, but i do not propose
arrangement here any more than elsewhere throughout my book) which
plutarch says he saw on board a ship. this dog being puzzled how to get
the [[oil]] that was in the bottom of a jar, which he could not reach with
his tongue by [[reason]] of the narrow mouth of the vessel, went and fetched
stones and let them fall into the jar till he made the [[oil]] rise so high
that he could reach it. what is this but an effect of a very subtle
capacity! ‘tis said that the ravens of barbary do the same, when the
water they would drink is too low. this action is somewhat akin to what
juba, a [[king]] of their nation relates of the elephants: “that when, by
the craft of the hunter, one of them is trapped in [[certain]] deep pits
prepared for them, and covered over with brush to [[deceive]] them, all the
rest, in [[great]] diligence, bring a [[great]] many stones and logs of wood to
raise the bottom so that he may get out.” but this animal, in
several other effects, comes so near to [[human]] capacity that, should i
particularly relate all that [[experience]] hath delivered to us, i should
easily have what i usually maintain granted: namely, that there is more
difference betwixt such and such a [[man]] than betwixt such a beast and
such a [[man]]. the keeper of an elephant in a private house of syria robbed
him every meal of the half of his allowance. one day his master would
himself feed him, and poured the full measure of barley he had ordered
for his allowance into his manger which the elephant, casting an angry
look at the keeper, with his trunk separated the one-half from the
other, and thrust it aside, by that declaring the [[wrong]] was done him.
and another, having a keeper that mixed stones with his corn to make
up the measure, came to the pot where he was boiling meat for his own
dinner, and filled it with ashes. these are particular effects: but that
which all the [[world]] has seen, and all the [[world]] knows [[know]], that in all the
armies of the levant one of the [[greatest]] [[force]] consisted in elephants,
with whom they did, without comparison, much greater execution than we
now do with our artillery; which takes, pretty nearly, their place in
a day of [[battle]] (as may easily be supposed by such as are well [[read]] in
ancient history);


      “the sires of these huge animals were wont
   the carthaginian hannibal to mount;
   our leaders also did these beasts bestride,
   and mounted thus pyrrhus his foes defied;
   nay, more, upon their backs they used to bear
   castles with armed cohorts to the [[war]].”


they must necessarily have very confidently relied upon the fidelity and
understanding of these beasts when they entrusted them with the vanguard
of a [[battle]], where the least stop they should have made, by [[reason]] of
the bulk and heaviness of their bodies [[body]], and the least fright that should
have made them face about upon their own [[people]], had been enough to
spoil all: and there are but few examples [[example]] where it has happened that
they have fallen foul upon their own [[troops]], whereas we ourselves break
into our own battalions and rout one another. they had the charge not of
one simple movement only, but of many several things to be performed in
the [[battle]]: as the spaniards did to their dogs in their new [[conquest]] of
the indies, to whom they gave [[pay]] and allowed them a share in the spoil;
and those animals showed as much dexterity and [[judgment]] in pursuing the
victory and stopping the pursuit; in charging and retiring, as occasion
required; and in distinguishing their [[friends]] from their enemies [[enemy]], as
they did ardour and fierceness.

we more [[admire]] and value things that are unusual and [[strange]] than those
of ordinary observation. i had not else so long insisted upon these
examples: for i [[believe]] whoever shall strictly observe what we
ordinarily see in those animals we have amongst us may there find as
wonderful effects as those we seek in remote countries [[country]] and ages [[age]]. ‘tis
one and the same [[nature]] that rolls on her course, and whoever has
sufficiently considered the [[present]] [[state]] of things, might certainly
conclude as to both the future ana the [[past]]. i have formerly seen [[men]],
brought hither by sea from very distant countries [[country]], whose [[language]] not
being understood by us, and moreover their mien, countenance, and habit,
being quite differing from ours; which of us did not repute them savages
and brutes! who did not attribute it to stupidity and want of common
sense to see them mute, ignorant of the french tongue, ignorant of our
salutations and cringes, our port and behaviour, from which all human
nature must by all means take its pattern and [[example]]. all that seems
strange to us, and that we do not [[understand]], we condemn. the same
thing happens also in the judgments [[judgment]] we make of beasts. they have several
conditions like to ours; from those we may, by comparison, draw some
conjecture: but by those qualities that are particular to themselves,
what [[know]] we what to make of them! the horses, dogs, oxen, sheep, birds,
and most of the animals that [[live]] amongst us, [[know]] our voices, and
suffer themselves to be governed by them: so did crassus’s lamprey, and
came when he called it; as also do the eels that are found in the lake
arethusa; and i have seen several ponds where the fishes come to [[eat]] at
a [[certain]] call of those who use to feed them.


      “they every one have names, and one and all
   straightway appear at their own master’s call:”


we may [[judge]] of that. we may also say that the elephants have some
participation of [[religion]] forasmuch as after several washings and
purifications they are observed to lift up their trunk like arms,
and, fixing their [[eyes]] towards the rising of the sun, continue long in
meditation and contemplation, at [[certain]] hours of the days, of their
own motion; without instruction or precept but because we do not see any
such signs in other animals, we cannot for that conclude that they are
without [[religion]], nor make any [[judgment]] of what is concealed from us. as
we discern something in this action which the philosopher cleanthes
took notice of, because it something resembles our own. he saw, he says,
“ants go from their ant-hill, carrying the [[dead]] [[body]] of an ant towards
another ant-hill, whence several other ants came out to meet them, as if
to speak with them; where, after having been a while together, the last
returned to consult, you may suppose, with their fellow-citizens, and so
made two or three journeys, by [[reason]] of the difficulty of capitulation.
in the conclusion, the [[last]] comers brought the first a worm out of their
burrow, as it were for the ransom of the defunct, which the first laid
upon their backs and carried [[home]], leaving the [[dead]] [[body]] to the others.”
 this was the interpretation that cleanthes gave of this transaction,
giving us by that to [[understand]] that those creatures that have no voice
are not, nevertheless, without intercourse and mutual communication,
whereof ‘tis through our own defect that we do not participate; and for
that [[reason]] foolishly take upon us to pass our censure. but they yet
produce either effects far beyond our capacity, to which we are so far
from being able to arrive by imitation that we cannot so much as by
imitation conceive it. many are of [[opinion]] that in the [[great]] and last
naval engagement that antony lost to augustus, his admiral galley was
stayed in the middle of her course by the little fish the latins call
_remora_, by [[reason]] of the [[property]] she has of staying all sorts of
vessels to which she fastens herself. and the [[emperor]] caligula, sailing
with a [[great]] navy upon the coast of romania, his galley only was
suddenly stayed by the same fish, which, he caused to be taken, fastened
as it was to the keel of his ship, very angry that such a little animal
could resist both the sea, the wind, and the [[force]] of all his oars, by
being only fastened by the beak to his galley (for it is a shell-fish);
and was moreover, not without [[great]] [[reason]], astonished that, being
brought to him in the vessel, it had no longer the [[strength]] it had
without. a citizen of cyzicus formerly acquired the [[reputation]] of a good
mathematician for having learnt the quality of the hedge-hog: he has his
burrow open in divers places, and to several winds, and, foreseeing the
wind that is to come, stops the hole on that side, which that citizen
observing, gave the [[city]] [[certain]] predictions of the wind which was
presently to blow. the caméléon takes her colour from the place upon
which she is laid; but the polypus gives himself what colour he pleases,
according to [[occasion]], either to conceal himself from what he fears [[fear]], or
from what he has a design to seize: in the caméléon ‘tis a passive, but
in the polypus ‘tis an active, [[change]]. we have some changes [[change]] of
colour, as in [[fear]], anger, shame, and other [[passions]], that alter our
complexions; but it is by the effect of suffering, as with the caméléon.
it is in the [[power]] of the jaundice, indeed, to make us turn yellow,
but ‘tis not in the [[power]] of our own will. now these effects that we
discover in other animals, much greater than ours, seem to imply some
more excellent faculty in them unknown to us; as ‘tis to be presumed
there are several other qualities and abilities of theirs, of which no
appearances have arrived at us.

amongst all the predictions of elder times [[time]], the most ancient and the
most [[certain]] were those taken from the flight of birds; we have nothing
certain like it, nor any thing to be so much admired. that [[rule]] and
order of the moving of the wing, whence they derived the consequences of
future things, must of necessity be guided by some excellent means to
so [[noble]] an operation: for to attribute this [[great]] effect to any natural
disposition, without the [[intelligence]], [[consent]], and meditation of him by
whom it is produced, is an [[opinion]] evidently false. that it is so, the
cramp-fish has this quality, not only to benumb all the members that
touch her, but even through the nets transmit a heavy dulness into the
hands of those that move and handle them; nay, it is further said that
if one pour water upon her, he will [[feel]] this numbness mount up the
water to the hand, and stupefy the feeling through the water. this is a
miraculous [[force]]; but ‘tis not useless to the cramp-fish; she knows [[know]] it,
and makes use on’t; for, to catch the prey she desires [[desire]], she will bury
herself in the mud, that other fishes swimming over her, struck and
benumbed with this coldness of hers, may fall into her [[power]]. cranes,
swallows, and other birds of passage, by shifting their abode according
to the seasons, sufficiently manifest the [[knowledge]] they have of their
divining faculty, and put it in use. huntsmen assure us that to cull out
from amongst a [[great]] many puppies that which ought to be preserved as
the [[best]], the [[best]] way is to refer the [[choice]] to the [[mother]]; as thus,
take them and carry them out of the kennel, and the first she brings
back will certainly be the [[best]]; or if you make a show as if you would
environ the kennel with [[fire]], that one she first catches up to save. by
which it appears they have a sort of prognostic which we have not; or
that they have some [[virtue]] in judging of their whelps other and more
certain than we have.

the manner of coming into the [[world]], of engendering, nourishing, acting,
moving, living and dying of beasts, is so near to ours that whatever we
retrench from their moving causes, and add to our own condition above
theirs, can by no means proceed from any meditation of our own [[reason]].
for the regimen of our health, physicians propose to us the [[example]] of
the beasts’ manners and way of living; for this saying (out of plutarch)
has in all times [[time]] been in the mouth of these [[people]]: “keep warm thy feet
and head, as to the rest, [[live]] like a beast.”

the [[chief]] of all [[natural]] actions is [[generation]]; we have a certain
disposition of members which is the most proper for us to that end;
nevertheless, we are ordered by lucretius to conform to the gesture and
posture of the brutes as the most effectual:--


      more ferarum,
   quadrupedumque magis ritu, plerumque putantur
   concipere uxores:
   quia sic loca sumere possunt,
   pectoribus positis, sublatis semina lumbis;


and the same [[authority]] condemns, as hurtful, those indiscreet and
impudent motions which the [[women]] have added of their own invention, to
whom it proposes the more temperate and modest pattern and practice of
the beasts of their own [[sex]]:--


      nam mulier prohibet se concipere atque répugnât,
   clunibus ipsa viri venerem si læta retractet,
   atque exossato ciet omni pectore fluctua.
   ejicit enim sulci recta regione viaque
   vomerem, atque locis avertit seminis ictum.


if it be [[justice]] to render to every one their due, the beasts that
serve, [[love]], and defend their benefactors, and that pursue and fall upon
strangers and those who offend them, do in this represent a [[certain]] air
of our [[justice]]; as also in observing a very equitable equality in the
distribution of what they have to their [[young]]. and as to [[friendship]],
they have it without comparison more lively and constant than [[men]] have.
king lysimachus’s dog, hyrcanus, master being [[dead]], lay on his bed,
obstinately refusing either to [[eat]] or drink; and, the day that his
body was burnt, he took a run and leaped into the [[fire]], where he was
consumed, as also did the dog of one pyrrhus, for he would not stir from
off his master’s bed from the [[time]] he died; and when they carried him
away let himself be carried with him, and at [[last]] leaped into the pile
where they burnt his master’s [[body]]. there are inclinations of affection
which sometimes spring in us, without the consultation of [[reason]]; and by
a fortuitous temerity, which others call sympathy; of which beasts
are as capable as we. we see horses take such an acquaintance with
one another that we have much ado to make them [[eat]] or travel, when
separated; we observe them to fancy a particular colour in those of
their own [[kind]], and, where they meet it, run to it with [[great]] joy and
demonstrations of [[good]] will, and have a dislike and [[hatred]] for some
other colour. animals have [[choice]], as well as we, in their amours, and
cull out their mistresses; neither are they exempt from our jealousies
and implacable malice.

desires are either [[natural]] and necessary, as to [[eat]] and drink; or
natural and not necessary, as the coupling with females; or neither
natural nor necessary; of which [[last]] sort are almost all the desires [[desire]] of
men; they are all superfluous and artificial. for ‘tis marvellous how
little will satisfy [[nature]], how little she has left us to [[desire]]; our
ragouts and kickshaws are not of her ordering. the stoics say that a man
may [[live]] on an olive a day. the delicacy of our wines is no part of her
instruction, nor the refinements we introduce into the indulgence of our
amorous appetites:--


      neque ilia
   magno prognatum deposcit consule cunnum.

      “nature, in her pursuit of [[love]], disclaims
   the [[pride]] of titles, and the pomp of names.”


these irregular desires [[desire]], that the ignorance of [[good]] and a false opinion
have infused into us, are so many that they almost exclude all the
natural; just as if there were so [[great]] a number of strangers in the
city as to thrust out the [[natural]] inhabitants, or, usurping upon their
ancient rights [[right]] and privileges [[privilege]], should extinguish their [[authority]] and
introduce new laws [[law]] and customs of their own. animals are much more
regular than we, and keep themselves with greater moderation within the
limits [[nature]] has prescribed; but yet not so exactly that they have not
sometimes an analogy with our debauches. and as there have been furious
desires that have impelled [[men]] to the [[love]] of beasts, so there have been
examples of beasts that have fallen in [[love]] with us, and been seized
with monstrous affection betwixt kinds [[kind]]; witness the elephant who was
rival to aristophanes the grammarian in the [[love]] of a [[young]] herb-wench
in the [[city]] of alexandria, who was nothing behind him in all the offices
of a very passionate suitor; for going through the market where they
sold fruit, he would take some in his trunk and carry them to her.
he would as much as possible keep her always in his sight, and would
sometimes put his trunk under her handkerchief into her bosom, to feel
her breasts. they tell also of a dragon in [[love]] with a girl, and of a
goose enamoured of a child; of a ram that was suitor to the minstrelless
glaucia, in the town of asopus; and we see not unfrequently baboons
furiously in [[love]] with [[women]]. we see also [[certain]] male animals that
are fond of the males of their own [[kind]]. oppian and others give us some
examples of the reverence that beasts have to their kindred in their
copulations; but [[experience]] often shows us the contrary:--


      nec habetur turpe juvencæ
   ferre patrem tergo; fit equo sua filia conjux;
   quasque creavit, init pecudes caper; ipsaque cujus
   semine concepta est, ex illo concipit ales.

      “the heifer thinks [[think]] it not a shame to take
   her lusty sire upon her willing back:
   the horse his [[daughter]] leaps, goats scruple not
   t’ increase the herd by those they have begot;
   and birds of all sorts do in [[common]] [[live]],
   and by the seed they have conceived conceive.”


and for subtle cunning, can there be a more pregnant [[example]] than in the
philosopher thales’s mule? who, fording a river, laden with salt, and
by accident stumbling there, so that the sacks he carried were all wet,
perceiving that by the melting of the salt his burden was something
lighter, he never failed, so oft as he came to any river, to [[lie]] down
with his load; till his master, discovering the knavery, ordered that he
should be laden with wood? wherein, finding himself mistaken, he ceased
to practise that device. there are several that very vividly represent
the true image of our avarice; for we see them infinitely solicitus to
get all they can, and hide it with that exceeding [[great]] [[care]], though
they never make any use of it at all. as to thrift, they surpass us not
only in the foresight and laying up, and saving for the [[time]] to come,
but they have, moreover, a [[great]] deal of the [[science]] necessary thereto.
the ants bring abroad into the sun their grain and seed to air, refresh
and dry them when they perceive them to mould and grow musty, lest they
should decay and rot. but the caution and prevention they use in gnawing
their grains of wheat surpass all [[imagination]] of [[human]] prudence; for by
reason that the wheat does not always continue sound and dry, but grows
soft, thaws and dissolves as if it were steeped in milk, whilst hasting
to germination; for [[fear]] lest it should shoot and lose the [[nature]] and
property of a magazine for their subsistence, they nibble off the end by
which it should shoot and sprout.

as to what concerns [[war]], which is the [[greatest]] and most magnificent of
human actions, i would very fain [[know]] whether we would use it for an
argument of some prerogative or, on contrary, for a testimony of our
weakness and imperfection; as, in [[truth]], the [[science]] of undoing and
killing one another, and of ruining and destroying our own [[kind]], has
nothing in it so tempting as to make it be coveted by beasts who have it
not.


      quando leoni fortior eripuit vitam leo? quo nemore unquam
   expiravit aper majoris dentibus apri?

      “no lion drinks a weaker lion’s gore,
   no boar expires beneath a stronger boar.”


yet are they not universally exempt; witness the furious encounters of
bees, and the enterprises of the princes [[prince]] of the contrary armies [[army]]:--


      sæpe duobus regibus incessit magno discordia motu;
   continuoque animos vulgi et trepidantia bello
   gorda licet longé præsciscere.

      “but if contending factions arm the hive,
   when rival kings [[king]] in doubtful [[battle]] strive,
   tumultuous crowds the dread event prepare,
   and palpitating hearts [[heart]] that beat to [[war]].”


i never [[read]] this [[divine]] description but that, methinks, i there see
human folly and vanity represented in their true and lively colours. for
these warlike movements, that so ravish us with their astounding noise
and [[horror]], this rattle of guns, drums, and cries,


      fulgur ibi ad coelum se tollit, totaque circum
   ære renidescit tellus, subterque virûm vi
   excitur pedibus sonitus, clamoreque montes
   icti rejectant voces ad sidera mundi;

      “when burnish’d arms to [[heaven]] dart their rays,
   and many a steely beam i’ th’ sunlight plays,
   when trampled is the [[earth]] by horse and [[man]],
   until the very centre groans again,
   and that the rocks, struck by the various cries,
   reverberate the sound unto the skies [[sky]];”


in the dreadful embattling of so many thousands of armed [[men]], and so
great fury, ardour, and [[courage]], ‘tis pleasant to consider by what idle
occasions they are excited, and by how [[light]] ones appeased:--


      paridis propter narratur amorem
   greciæ barbariæ diro collisa duello:

      “of wanton [[paris]] the illicit love
   did greece and troy to ten years’ warfare move:”


all [[asia]] was ruined and destroyed for the [[lust]] of [[paris]]; the envy of
one [[single]] [[man]], a despite, a [[pleasure]], a domestic [[jealousy]], causes that
ought not to set two oyster-wenches by the ears, is the mover of all
this mighty bustle. shall we [[believe]] those very [[men]] who are themselves
the principal authors of these mischiefs? let us then hear the [[greatest]],
the most powerful, the most victorious [[emperor]] that ever was, turning
into a jest, very pleasantly and ingeniously, several battles [[battle]] fought
both by sea and [[land]], the [[blood]] and lives [[life]] of five hundred thousand men
that followed his [[fortune]], and the [[strength]] and riches [[rich]] of two parts of
the [[world]] drained for the expense of his expeditions:--


      quod futuit glaphyran antonius, hanc mihi poenam
   fulvia constituit, se quoqne uti futuam.
   fulviam ego ut futuam! quid, si me manius oret
   podicem, faciam? non puto, si sapiam.
   aut futue, aut pugnemus, ait
   quid, si mihi vitii
   charior est ipsâ mentula? signa canant.

      qui? moi, que je serve fulvie!
   sufflt-il quelle en ait envie?
   a ce compte, on verrait se retirer von moi
   mille épouses mal satisfaites.
   aime-moi, me dit elle, ou combattons. mais quoi?
   elle est bien laide! allons, sonnes trompettes.

       ‘cause anthony is fired with glaphire’s charms
   fain would his fulvia tempt me to her arms.
   if anthony be false, what then? must i
   be [[slave]] to fulvia’s lustful [[tyranny]]?
   then would a thousand wanton, waspish wives [[wife]],


(i use my latin with the [[liberty]] of [[conscience]] you are pleased to allow
me.) now this [[great]] [[body]], with so many fronts, and so many motions,
which seems to threaten [[heaven]] and [[earth]]:--


      quam multi lybico volvuntur marmore fluctus,
   sævus ubi orion hibemis conditur undis,
   vel quam solo novo densæ torrentur aristæ,
   aut hermi campo, aut lyciæ flaventibus arvis;
   scuta sonant, pulsuque pedum tremit excita tellus:

      “not thicker billows beat the lybian main,
   when pale orion sits in wintry rain;
   nor thicker harvests on [[rich]] hermus rise,
   or lycian fields, when phobus burns the skies [[sky]],
   than stand these [[troops]]: their bucklers ring around;
   their trampling turns the turf and shakes the solid ground:”


this furious monster, with so many heads and arms, is yet man--feeble,
calamitous, and miserable man! ‘tis but an ant-hill disturbed and
provoked:--


   it nigrum campis agmen:

   “the black troop marches to the field:”


a contrary blast, the croaking of a flight of ravens, the stumble of
a horse, the casual passage of an eagle, a [[dream]], a voice, a sign, a
morning mist, are any one of them sufficient to beat down and overturn
him. dart but a sunbeam in his face, he is melted and vanished. blow
but a little dust in his [[eyes]], as our poet says of the bees, and all our
ensigns and legions, with the [[great]] pompey himself at the head of them,
are routed and crushed to pieces; for it was he, as i take it, that
sertorious beat in [[spain]] with those fine arms, which also served eumenes
against antigonus, and surena against crassus:--


      “swarm to my bed like bees into their hives.
   declare for [[love]], or [[war]], she said; and frown’d:
   no [[love]] i’ll grant: to arms bid trumpets sound.”


      hi motus animorum, atque hoc certamina tanta,
   pulveris exigui jactu compressa quiescent.

      “yet at thy will these dreadful conflicts cease,
   throw but a little dust and all is [[peace]].”


let us but slip our flies after them, and they will have the [[force]] and
courage to defeat them. of fresh memory, the portuguese having besieged
the [[city]] of tamly, in the territory of xiatine, the inhabitants of the
place brought a [[great]] many hives, of which are [[great]] plenty in that
place, upon the wall; and with [[fire]] drove the bees so furiously upon the
enemy that they gave over the enterprise, not being able to stand their
attacks and endure their stings; and so the [[citizens]], by this new sort
of relief, gained [[liberty]] and the [[victory]] with so wonderful a [[fortune]],
that at the return of their defenders from the [[battle]] they found they
had not lost so much as one. the souls [[soul]] of emperors [[emperor]] and cobblers are cast
in the same mould; the weight and importance of the actions of princes
considered, we persuade ourselves that they must be produced by some as
weighty and important causes; but we are deceived; for they are pushed
on, and pulled back in their motions, by the same springs that we are
in our little undertakings. the same [[reason]] that makes us wrangle with
a neighbour causes a [[war]] betwixt princes [[prince]]; the same [[reason]] that makes us
whip a lackey, falling into the hands of a [[king]] makes him ruin a whole
province. they are as lightly moved as we, but they are able to do more.
in a gnat and an elephant the passion is the same.

as to fidelity, there is no animal in the [[world]] so [[treacherous]] as [[man]].
our histories [[history]] have recorded the [[violent]] pursuits that dogs have made
after the murderers of their masters. [[king]] pyrrhus observing a dog that
watched a [[dead]] man’s [[body]], and understanding that he had for three
days together performed that office, commanded that the [[body]] should be
buried, and took the dog along with him. one day, as he was at a general
muster of his [[army]], this dog, seeing his master’s murderers, with great
barking and extreme signs of anger flew upon them, and by this first
accusation awakened the [[revenge]] of this murder, which was soon after
perfected by form of [[justice]]. as much was done by the dog of the wise
hesiod, who convicted the sons [[son]] of ganictor of naupactus of the murder
committed on the [[person]] of his master. another dog being to guard a
temple at [[athens]], having spied a sacrilegious thief carrying away
the finest jewels, fell to barking at him with all his [[force]], but the
warders not awaking at the noise, he followed him, and day being broke,
kept off at a little distance, without losing sight of him; if he
offered him any thing to [[eat]] he would not take it, but would wag his
tail at all the passengers he met, and took whatever they gave him; and
if the thief laid down to sleep, he likewise stayed upon the same place.
the news of this dog being come to the warders of the temple they put
themselves upon the pursuit, inquiring of the colour of the dog, and
at [[last]] found him in the [[city]] of cromyon, and the thief also, whom they
brought back to [[athens]], where he got his [[reward]]; and the judges [[judge]], in
consideration of this [[good]] office, ordered a [[certain]] measure of corn
for the dog’s daily sustenance, at the [[public]] charge, and the priests [[priest]] to
take [[care]] of it. plutarch delivers this story for a [[certain]] [[truth]], and
that it happened in the [[age]] wherein he lived.

as to gratitude (for i [[think]] we need bring this word into a little
repute), this one [[example]], which apion reports himself to have been an
eye-witness of, shall suffice.

“one day,” says he, “at [[rome]], they entertained the [[people]] with the sight
of the fighting of several [[strange]] beasts, and principally of lions
of an unusual size; there was one amongst the rest who, by his furious
deportment, by the [[strength]] and largeness of his limbs, and by his loud
and dreadful roaring, attracted the [[eyes]] of all the spectators. amongst
other slaves [[slave]] that were presented to the [[people]] in this combat of beasts
there was one androdus, of dacia, belonging to a roman [[lord]] of consular
dignity. this lion having seen him at a distance first made a sudden
stop, as it were in a wondering posture, and then softly approached
nearer in a gentle and peaceable manner, as if it were to enter into
acquaintance with him. this being done, and being now assured of what he
sought for, he began to wag his tail, as dogs do when they flatter their
masters, and to kiss and lick the hands and thighs of the [[poor]] wretch,
who was beside himself, and almost [[dead]] with [[fear]]. androdus being by
this [[kindness]] of the lion a little come to himself, and having taken so
much [[heart]] as to consider and [[know]] him, it was a singular [[pleasure]] to
see the joy and caresses that passed betwixt them. at which the people
breaking into loud acclamations of joy, the [[emperor]] caused the slave
to be called, to [[know]] from him the cause of so [[strange]] an event; who
thereupon told him a new and a very [[strange]] story: “my master,” said
he, “being pro-consul in [[africa]], i was constrained, by his severity and
cruel usage, being daily beaten, to steal from him and run away; and,
to hide myself secretly from a [[person]] of so [[great]] [[authority]] in the
province, i [[thought]] it my [[best]] way to fly to the solitudes, sands, and
uninhabitable parts of that [[country]], resolving that in case the means of
supporting [[life]] should [[chance]] to fail me, to make some shift or other
to kill myself. the sun being excessively hot at noon, and the heat
intolerable, i lit upon a private and almost inaccessible cave, and went
into it soon after there came in to me this lion, with one foot wounded
and bloody, complaining and groaning with the [[pain]] he endured. at his
coming i was exceeding afraid; but he having spied me hid in the comer
of his den, came gently to me, holding out and showing me his wounded
foot, as if he demanded my assistance in his distress. i then drew out
a [[great]] splinter he had got there, and, growing a little more familiar
with him, squeezing the wound thrust out the matter, dirt, and gravel
which was got into it, and wiped and cleansed it the [[best]] i could. he,
finding himself something [[better]], and much eased of his [[pain]], laid him
down to rest, and presently fell asleep with his foot in my hand. from
that [[time]] forward he and i lived together in this cave three whole years
upon one and the same diet; for of the beasts that he killed in hunting
he always brought me the [[best]] pieces, which i roasted in the sun for
want of [[fire]], and so ate it. at [[last]], growing weary of this wild
and brutish [[life]], the lion being one day gone abroad to hunt for our
ordinary provision, i departed thence, and the third day after was taken
by the soldiers, who brought me from [[africa]] to this [[city]] to my master,
who presently condemned me to [[die]], and to be thus exposed to the wild
beasts. now, by what i see, this lion was also taken soon after, who has
now sought to recompense me for the benefit and cure that he received
at my hands.” this is the story that androdus told the [[emperor]], which he
also conveyed from hand to hand to the [[people]]; wherefore, at the general
request, he was absolved from his sentence and set at [[liberty]], and the
lion was, by order of the [[people]], presented to him. “we afterwards saw,”
 says apion, “androdus leading this lion, in nothing but a small leash,
from tavern to tavern at [[rome]], and receiving what [[money]] every [[body]] would
give him, the lion being so gentle as to suffer himself to be covered
with the flowers that the [[people]] threw upon him, every one that met him
saying, ‘there goes the lion that entertained the [[man]]; there goes the
man that cured the lion.’”

we often lament the loss of beasts we [[love]], and so do they the loss of
us:--


      post, bellator equus, positis insignibus, æthon
   it lacrymans, guttisque humectât grandibus ora.

      “to close the pomp, æthon, the steed of [[state]].
   is [[led]], the fun’ral of his [[lord]] to wait.
   stripped of his trappings, with a sullen pace
   he walks, and the big tears run rolling down his face.”


as some nations have their wives [[wife]] in [[common]], and some others have every
one his own, is not the same seen among beasts, and marriages [[marriage]] better
kept than ours? as to the [[society]] and confederation they make
amongst themselves, to league together and to give one another mutual
assistance, is it not known that oxen, hogs, and other animals, at the
cry of any of their [[kind]] that we offend, all the herd run to his aid
and embody for his defence? the fish scarus, when he has swallowed the
angler’s hook, his fellows all crowd about him and gnaw the line in
pieces; and if, by [[chance]], one be got into the bow net, the others
present him their tails on the outside, which he holding fast with his
teeth, they after that manner disengage and draw him out.

mullets, when one of their companions is engaged, cross the line over
their back, and, with a fin they have there, indented like a saw, cut
and saw it asunder. as to the particular offices that we receive from
one another for the service of [[life]], there are several like examples
amongst them. ‘tis said that the whale never moves that she has not
always before her a little fish like the sea-gudgeon, for this reason
called the guide-fish, whom the whale follows, suffering himself to be
led and turned with as [[great]] facility as the rudder guides the ship; in
recompense of which service also, whereas all the other things, whether
beast or vessel, that enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster’s
mouth, are immediately lost and swallowed up, this little fish retires
into it in [[great]] security, and there sleeps, during which [[time]] the whale
never stirs; but so soon as ever it goes out he immediately follows
it; and if by accident he loses the sight of his little guide, he goes
wandering here and there, and strikes his sides against the rocks like a
ship that has lost her helm; which plutarch affirms to have seen in
the island of anticyra. there is a like [[society]] betwixt the little bird
called the wren and the crocodile. the wren serves for a sentinel over
this [[great]] animal; and if the ichneumon, his mortal [[enemy]], approach
to [[fight]] him, this little bird, for [[fear]] lest he should surprise him
asleep, both with his voice and bill rouses him and gives him notice
of his danger. he feeds of this monster’s leavings, who receives him
familiarly into his mouth, suffering him to peck in his jaws and betwixt
his teeth, and thence to pick out the bits of flesh that remain; and
when he has a [[mind]] to shut his mouth, he first gives the bird warning to
go out by closing it by little and little, and without bruising or doing
it any harm at all. the shell-fish called the naker, lives [[life]] in the same
intelligence with the shrimp, a little sort of animal of the lobster
kind, which serves him in the [[nature]] of a porter, sitting at the opening
of the shell, which the naker keeps always gaping and open till the
shrimp sees some little fish, proper for their prey, within the hollow
of the shell, where she enters too, and pinches the naker so to the
quick that she is forced to close her shell, where they two together
devour the prey they have trapped in their fort. in the manner of living
of the tunnies we observe a singular [[knowledge]] of the three parts of
mathematics. as to astrology, they [[teach]] it [[men]], for they stay in the
place where they are surprised by the brumal solstice, and never
stir thence till the next equinox; for which [[reason]] [[aristotle]] himself
attributes to them this [[science]]. as to geometry and arithmetic, they
always form their numbers in the figure of a cube, every way square, and
make up the [[body]] of a battalion, solid, close, and environed round
with six [[equal]] sides, and swim in this square order, as large behind
as before; so that whoever in seeing them can count one rank may
easily number the whole troop, by [[reason]] that the depth is [[equal]] to the
breadth, and the breadth to the length.

as to magnanimity, it will be hard to exhibit a [[better]] instance of it
than in the [[example]] of the [[great]] dog sent to alexander the [[great]] from
the indies. they first brought him a stag to encounter, next a boar, and
after that a bear, all which he slighted, and disdained to stir from
his place; but when he saw a lion he then immediately roused himself,
evidently manifesting that he declared that alone worthy to enter the
lists with him. touching repentance and the acknowledgment of faults [[fault]],
‘tis reported of an elephant that, having in the impetuosity of his rage
killed his keeper, he fell into so extreme a [[sorrow]] that he would never
after [[eat]], but starved himself to [[death]]. and as to clemency, ‘tis said
of a tiger, the most cruel of all beasts, that a kid having been put
in to him, he [[suffered]] a two days’ [[hunger]] rather than hurt it, and the
third broke the grate he was shut up in, to seek elsewhere for prey; so
unwilling he was to fall upon the kid, his familiar and his guest, and
as to the laws [[law]] of familiarity and agreement, formed by conversation,
it ordinarily happens that we bring up cats, dogs, and hares, tame
together.

but that which seamen by [[experience]] [[know]], and particularly in the
sicilian sea, of the quality of the halcyons, surpasses all human
thought of what [[kind]] of animal has [[nature]] even so much honoured the
birth? the poets indeed say that one only island, delos, which was
before a floating island, was fixed for the service of latona’s
lying-in; but [[god]] has ordered that the whole ocean should be stayed,
made stable and smooth, without waves, without winds or rain, whilst
the halcyon produces [[produce]] her [[young]], which is just about the solstice, the
shortest day of the year; so that by her [[privilege]] we have seven days
and seven nights in the very [[heart]] of winter wherein we may sail without
danger. their females never have to do with any other male but their
own, whom they serve and assist all their lives [[life]], without ever forsaking
him. if he becomes [[weak]] and broken with [[age]], they take him upon their
shoulders and carry him from place to place, and serve him till [[death]].
but the most inquisitive into the secrets of [[nature]] could never yet
arrive at the [[knowledge]] of the wonderful fabric wherewith the halcyon
builds her nest for her little ones, nor guess at the materials.
plutarch, who has seen and handled many of them, thinks [[think]] it is the bones
of some fish which she joins and binds together, interlacing them, some
lengthwise and others across, and adding ribs and hoops in such manner
that she forms at [[last]] a round vessel fit to launch; which being done,
and the building finished, she carries it to the beach, where the sea
beating gently against it shows where she is to mend what is not well
jointed and knit, and where [[better]] to fortify the seams that are leaky,
that open at the beating of the waves; and, on the contrary, what is
well built and has had the due finishing, the beating of the waves does
so close and bind together that it is not to be broken or cracked by
blows either of stone or iron without very much ado. and that which is
more to be admired is the proportion and figure of the cavity within,
which is composed and proportioned after such a manner as not to receive
or admit any other thing than the bird that built it; for to any thing
else it is so impenetrable, close, and shut, nothing can enter, not so
much as the water of the sea. this is a very dear description of this
building, and borrowed from a very [[good]] hand; and yet me-thinks it does
not give us sufficient [[light]] into the difficulty of this architecture.
now from what vanity can it proceed to despise and look down upon,
and disdainfully to interpret, effects that we can neither imitate nor
comprehend?

to pursue a little further this equality and correspondence betwixt us
and beasts, the [[privilege]] our [[soul]] so much glorifies herself upon, of
things she conceives to her own [[law]], of striping all things that come
to her of their mortal and corporeal qualities, of ordering and
placing things she conceives worthy her taking notice of, stripping and
divesting them of their corruptible qualities, and making them to
lay aside length, breadth, depth, weight, colour, smell, roughness,
smoothness, hardness, softness, and all sensible accidents, as mean
and superfluous vestments, to accommodate them to her own [[immortal]] and
spiritual condition; as [[rome]] and [[paris]], for [[example]], that i have in
my fancy, [[paris]] that i imagine, i imagine and comprehend it without
greatness and without place, without stone, without plaster, and without
wood; this very same [[privilege]], i say, seems evidently to be in beasts;
for a courser accustomed to trumpets, to musket-shots, and battles [[battle]], whom
we see start and tremble in his sleep and stretched upon his litter,
as if he were in a [[fight]]; it is almost [[certain]] that he conceives in
his [[soul]] the beat of a drum without noise, and an [[army]] without arms and
without [[body]]:--


      quippe videbis equos fortes, cum membra jacebunt
   in somnis, sudare tamen, spirareque sæpe,
   et quasi de palmâ summas contendere vires:

      “you shall see maneg’d horses in their sleep
   sweat, snort, start, tremble, and a clutter keep,
   as if with all their [[force]] they striving were
   the victor’s palm proudly away to bear:”


the hare, that a greyhound imagines in his sleep, after which we see
him pant so whilst he sleeps, stretch out his tail, shake his legs, and
perfectly represents all the motions of a course, is a hare without fur
and without bones:--


      venantumque canes in molli sæpe quiete
   jactant crura tamen subito, vocesque repente
   mittunt, et crebras reducunt naribus auras,
   ut vestigia si teneant inventa ferarum:
   expergefætique sequuntur inania sæpe
   cervorum simulacra, fagæ quasi dedita cernant;
   donee discussis redeant erroribus ad se:

      “and hounds stir often in their quiet rest,
   spending their mouths, as if upon a quest,
   snuff, and breathe quick and short, as if they went
   in a full chase upon a burning scent:
   nay, being wak’d, imagin’d stags pursue,
   as if they had them in their real view,
   till, having shook themselves more broad awake,
   they do at [[last]] discover the mistake:”


the watch-dogs, that we often observe to snarl in their dreams [[dream]], and
afterwards bark out, and start up as if they perceived some stranger
at hand; the stranger that their [[soul]] discerns is a [[man]] [[spiritual]] and
imperceptible, without dimension, without colour, and without being:--


      consueta domi catulorum blanda propago
   degere, sæpe levem ex oculis volucremque soporem
   discutere, et corpus de terra corripere instant,
   proinde quasi ignotas facies atque ora tuantur.

      “the fawning whelps of household curs will rise,
   and, shaking the soft slumber from their [[eyes]],
   oft bark and stare at ev’ry one within,
   as upon faces they had never seen.”


to the [[beauty]] of the [[body]], before i proceed any further i should know
whether or no we are agreed about the description. ‘tis likely we do
not well [[know]] what [[beauty]] is in [[nature]] and in general, since to our
own [[human]] [[beauty]] we give so many divers forms, of which, were there any
natural [[rule]] and prescription, we should [[know]] it in [[common]], as the heat
of the [[fire]]. but we fancy the forms according to our own appetite and
liking:--


   turpis romano belgicus ore color:

   “a [[german]] hue ill suits, a roman face.”


the indians [[indian]] paint it black and tawny, with [[great]] swelled lips, wide flat
noses and load the cartilage betwixt the nostrils with [[great]] rings of
gold, to make it hang down to the mouth; as also the under lip with
great hoops, enriched with precious stones, that weigh them down to fall
upon the chin, it being with them a singular grace to show their teeth,
even below the roots. in peru the [[greatest]] ears are the most beautiful,
which they stretch out as far as they can by art [[arts]]. and a [[man]] now living
says that he has seen in an eastern nation this [[care]] of enlarging them
in so [[great]] repute, and the ear loaded with so ponderous jewels, that he
did with [[great]] ease put his arm, sleeve and all, through the hole of
an ear. there are elsewhere nations that take [[great]] [[care]] to black their
teeth, and hate to see them [[white]], whilst others paint them red. the
women are reputed more beautiful, not only in biscay, but elsewhere,
for having their heads shaved; and, which is more, in [[certain]] frozen
countries, as pliny reports. the mexicans esteem a low forehead a great
beauty, and though they shave all other parts, they nourish hair on
the forehead and increase it by art [[arts]], and have [[great]] breasts in so great
reputation that they affect to give their [[children]] suck over their
shoulders. we should paint deformity so. the italians [[fashion]] it gross
and massy; the spaniards gaunt and slender; and amongst us one has
it [[white]], another brown; one soft and delicate, another [[strong]] and
vigorous; one will have his mistress soft and gentle, others haughty and
majestic. just as the preference in [[beauty]] that [[plato]] attributes to the
spherical figure the epicureans gave rather to the pyramidal or square,
and cannot swallow a [[god]] in the form of a bowl. but, be it how it will,
nature has no more privileged us in this from her [[common]] laws [[law]] than in
the rest and if we will [[judge]] ourselves aright, we shall find that, if
there be some animals less favoured in this than we, there are others,
and in greater number, that are more; _a multis animalibus decore
vincimur_ “many animals surpass us in [[beauty]],” even among the
terrestrial, our compatriots; for as to those of sea, setting the figure
aside, which cannot fall into any manner of proportion, being so much
another thing in colour, clearness, smoothness, and arrangement, we
sufficiently give place to them; and no less, in all qualities, to the
aerial. and this prerogative that the poets make such a mighty matter
of, our erect stature, looking towards [[heaven]] our original,


      pronaque cum spectent animalia cætera terrain,
   os homini sublime dédit, columque tueri
   jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus,

      “whilst all the brutal creatures downward bend
   their sight, and to their earthly [[mother]] tend,
   he set man’s face aloft, that, with his eyes
   uplifted, he might view the starry skies [[sky]],”


is truly poetical; for there are several little beasts who have their
sight absolutely turned towards [[heaven]]; and i find the gesture of camels
and ostriches much higher raised and more erect than ours. what animals
have not their faces above and not before, and do not look opposite,
as we do; and that do not in their [[natural]] posture discover as much of
heaven and [[earth]] as [[man]]? and what qualities of our bodily [[constitution]],
in [[plato]] and cicero, may not indifferently serve a thousand sorts of
beasts? those that most resemble us are the most despicable and deformed
of all the herd; for those, as to outward appearance and form of visage,
are baboons:--


      simia quam similis, turpissima bestia, nobis?

      “how like to [[man]], in visage and in shape,
   is, of all beasts the most uncouth, the ape?”


as to the internal and vital parts, the hog. in earnest, when i consider
man stark naked, even in that [[sex]] which seems to have [[greatest]] share of
beauty, his defects, [[natural]] subjection, and imperfections, i find that
we have more [[reason]] than any other animal, to cover ourselves; and are
to be excused from borrowing of those to whom [[nature]] has in this been
kinder than to us, to trick ourselves out with their beauties [[beauty]], and hide
ourselves under their spoils, their wool, feathers, hair, and silk. let
us observe, as to the rest, that [[man]] is the sole animal whose nudities
offend his own companions, and the only one who in his [[natural]] actions
withdraws and hides himself from his own [[kind]]. and really ‘tis also
an effect worth consideration, that they who are masters in the trade
prescribe, as a remedy for amorous [[passions]], the full and [[free]] view of
the [[body]] a [[man]] desires [[desire]]; for that to cool the ardour there needs no more
but freely and fully to see what he loves [[love]]:--


      ille quod obscænas in aperto corpore partes
   viderat, in cursu qui fuit, hæsit amor.

      “the [[love]] that’s tilting when those parts appear
   open to view, flags in the hot [[career]],”


and, although this receipt may peradventure proceed from a nice and cold
humour, it is notwithstanding a very [[great]] sign of our deficiencies
that use and acquaintance should make us disgust one another. it is
not modesty, so much as cunning and prudence, that makes our ladies [[lady]] so
circumspect to refuse us admittance into their cabinets before they are
painted and tricked up for the [[public]] view:--


      nec veneres nostras hoc fallit; quo magis ipsæ
   omnia summopere hos vitæ postscenia celant,
   quos retinere volunt, adstrictoque esse in amore:

      “of this our ladies [[lady]] are full well aware,
   which make them, with such privacy and [[care]],
   behind the scene all those defects remove,
   likely to check the flame of those they [[love]],”


whereas, in several animals there is nothing that we do not [[love]], and
that does not please our senses; so that from their very excrements
we do not only extract wherewith to heighten our sauces, but also our
richest ornaments and perfumes. this discourse reflects upon none but
the ordinary sort of [[women]], and is not so sacrilegious as to comprehend
those [[divine]], supernatural, and extraordinary beauties [[beauty]], which we see
shine occasionally among us like stars under a corporeal and terrestrial
veil.

as to the rest, the very share that we allow to beasts of the bounty
of [[nature]], by our own [[confession]], is very much to their advantage. we
attribute to ourselves imaginary and fantastic [[good]], future and absent
good, for which [[human]] capacity cannot of herself be responsible; or
good, that we falsely attribute to ourselves by the license of [[opinion]],
as [[reason]], [[knowledge]], and [[honour]], and leave to them for their dividend,
essential, durable, and palpable [[good]], as [[peace]], repose, security,
innocence, and health; health, i say, the fairest and richest present
that [[nature]] can make us. insomuch that [[philosophy]], even the stoic, is so
bold as to say, “that heraclitus and pherecides, could they have trucked
their [[wisdom]] for health, and have delivered themselves, the one of his
dropsy, and the other of the lousy disease that tormented him, they had
done well.” by which they set a greater value upon [[wisdom]], comparing and
putting it into the balance with health, than they do with this other
proposition, which is also theirs; they say that if circe had presented
ulysses with the two potions, the one to make a [[fool]] become a wise
man, and the other to make a [[wise]] [[man]] become a [[fool]], that [[ulysses]] ought
rather to have chosen the [[last]], than [[consent]] to that by which circe
changed his [[human]] figure into that of a beast; and say that wisdom
itself would have spoke to him after this manner: “forsake me, let me
alone, rather than lodge me under the [[body]] and figure of an ass.” how!
the [[philosophers]], then will abandon this [[great]] and [[divine]] [[wisdom]] for
this corporeal and terrestrial covering? it is then no more by [[reason]],
by discourse, and by the [[soul]], that we excel beasts; ‘tis by our [[beauty]],
our [[fair]] [[complexion]], and our fine symmetry of parts, for which we must
quit our [[intelligence]], our prudence, and all the rest. well, i accept
this open and [[free]] [[confession]]; certainly they knew that those parts,
upon which we so much value ourselves, are no other than [[vain]] fancy.
if beasts then had all the [[virtue]], [[knowledge]], [[wisdom]], and stoical
perfection, they would still be beasts, and would not be comparable to
man, miserable, wicked, mad, [[man]]. for, in short, whatever is not as we
are is nothing worth; and [[god]], to procure himself an esteem among us,
must put himself into that shape, as we shall show anon. by which it
appears that it is not upon any true ground of [[reason]], but by a foolish
pride and [[vain]] [[opinion]], that we prefer ourselves before other animals,
and separate ourselves from their [[society]] and condition.

but to return to what i was upon before; we have for our part
inconstancy, irresolution, incertitude, [[sorrow]], superstition, solicitude
of things to come, even after we shall be no more, [[ambition]], avarice,
jealousy, envy, irregular, frantic, and untamed appetites, [[war]], lying,
disloyalty, detraction, and curiosity. doubtless, we have strangely
overpaid this fine [[reason]], upon which we so much glorify ourselves, and
this capacity of judging and knowing, if we have bought it at the price
of this infinite number of [[passions]] to which we are eternally [[subject]].
unless we shall also [[think]] fit, as even [[socrates]] does, to add to the
counterpoise that notable prerogative above beasts, that whereas nature
has prescribed them [[certain]] seasons and limits for the delights of
venus, she has given us the reins at all hours and all seasons.” _ut
vinum ogrotis, quia prodest rarô, nocet sopissime, melius est non
adhibere omnino, quam, spe dubio salutis, in apertam per-niciem
incurrere; sic, haud scio an melius fuerit humano generi motum istum
celerem cogitationis, acumen, solertiam, quam rationem vocamus, quoniam
pestifera sint multis, ad-modum paucis saluiaria, non dari omnino,
quam tam muniice et tam large dari?_ as it falls out that wine often
hurting the sick, and very rarely doing them [[good]], it is [[better]] not to
give them any at all than to run into an apparent danger out of [[hope]] of
an uncertain benefit, so i [[know]] not whether it had not been [[better]] for
mankind that this quick motion, this penetration, this subtlety that we
call [[reason]], had not been given to [[man]] at all; considering how pestiferous
it is to many, and useful but to few, than to have been conferred in so
abundant manner, and with so liberal a hand.” of what advantage can we
conceive the [[knowledge]] of so many things was to yarro and [[aristotle]]? did
it exempt them from [[human]] inconveniences? were they by it freed from
the accidents that lay heavy upon the shoulders of a porter? did they
extract from their [[logic]] any consolation for the gout? or, for knowing
how this [[humour]] is lodged in the joints, did they [[feel]] it the less?
did they enter into composition with [[death]] by knowing that some nations
rejoice at his approach; or with cuckoldry, by knowing that in some
parts of the [[world]] wives [[wife]] are in [[common]]? on the contrary, having been
reputed the [[greatest]] [[men]] for [[knowledge]], the one amongst the romans
and the other amongst the greeks [[greek]], and in a [[time]] when learning did most
flourish, we have not heard, nevertheless, that they had any particular
excellence in their lives [[life]]; nay, the [[greek]] had enough to do to clear
himself from some notable blemishes in his. have we observed that
pleasure and health have a [[better]] relish with him that understands
astrology and grammar than with others?


   illiterati num minus nervi rigent?

   “th’ illiterate ploughman is as fit
   for venus’ service as the wit:”


or shame and [[poverty]] less troublesome to the first than to the [[last]]?


      scilicet et morbis et debilitate carebis,
   et luctum et curam effugies, et tempora vitæ
   longa tibi post hæc fato meliore dabuntur.

      “disease thy couch shall flee,
   and [[sorrow]] and [[care]]; yes, thou, be sure, wilt see
   long years of [[happiness]], till now unknown.”


i have known in my [[time]] a hundred artisans, a hundred labourers, wiser
and more [[happy]] than the rectors of the [[university]], and whom i had much
rather have resembled. learning, methinks, has its place amongst the
necessary, things of [[life]], as [[glory]], nobility, [[dignity]], or at the most,
as [[beauty]], riches [[rich]], and such other qualities, which indeed are useful
to it, but remotely, and more by [[opinion]] than by [[nature]]. we stand
very little more in need of offices, rules [[rule]], and laws [[law]] of living in our
society, than cranes and ants do in theirs; and yet we see that these
carry themselves very regularly without erudition. if [[man]] was [[wise]], he
would take the true value of every thing according as it was useful
and proper to his [[life]]. whoever will number us by our actions and
deportments will find many more excellent [[men]] amongst the ignorant than
among the learned; aye, in all sorts of [[virtue]]. old [[rome]] seems to me
to have been of much greater value, both for [[peace]] and [[war]], than that
learned [[rome]] that ruined itself. and, though all the rest should be
equal, yet integrity and innocency would remain to the ancients, for
they cohabit singularly well with simplicity. but i will leave this
discourse, that would lead me farther than i am willing to [[follow]]; and
shall only say this further, ‘tis only [[humility]] and submission that can
make a complete [[good]] [[man]]. we are not to leave the [[knowledge]] of his duty
to every man’s own [[judgment]]; we are to prescribe it to him, and not
suffer him to choose it at his own discretion; otherwise, according to
the imbecility, and infinite variety of our reasons [[reason]] and opinions [[opinion]], we
should at large forge ourselves duties [[duty]] that would, as epicurus says,
enjoin us to [[eat]] one another.

the first [[law]] that ever [[god]] gave to [[man]] was a [[law]] of pure [[obedience]]; it
was a commandment naked and simple, wherein [[man]] had nothing to inquire
after, nor to dispute; forasmuch as to obey is the proper office of a
rational [[soul]], acknowledging a heavenly superior and benefactor. from
obedience and submission spring all other virtues [[virtue]], as all [[sin]] does from
selfopinion. and, on the contrary, the first temptation that by the
devil was offered to [[human]] [[nature]], its first poison insinuated itself
into us by the promise made us of [[knowledge]] and [[wisdom]]; _eritis sicut
dii, scientes bonum et malum._ “ye shall be as gods, knowing [[good]] and
evil.” and the sirens, in [[homer]], to allure [[ulysses]], and draw him within
the danger of their snares, offered to give him [[knowledge]]. the plague of
man is the [[opinion]] of [[wisdom]]; and for this [[reason]] it is that ignorance
is so recommended to us, by our [[religion]], as proper to [[faith]] and
obedience; _cavete ne quis vos decipiat per philosophiam et inanes
seductiones, secundum elementa mundi._ “take heed, lest any [[man]] deceive
you by [[philosophy]] and [[vain]] deceit, after the tradition of [[men]], and the
rudiments of the [[world]].” there is in this a general [[consent]] amongst
all sorts of [[philosophers]], that the [[sovereign]] [[good]] consists in the
tranquillity of the [[soul]] and [[body]]; but where shall we find it?


      ad summum, sapiens uno minor est jove, dives,
   liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex deniqne regum;
   præcipue sanus, nisi cum pituita molesta est:

      “in short, the [[wise]] is only less than jove,
   [[rich]], [[free]], and handsome; nay, a [[king]] above
   all earthly kings [[king]]; with health supremely blest,
   excepting when a cold disturbs his rest!”


it seems, in [[truth]], that [[nature]], for the consolation of our miserable
and wretched [[state]], has only given us presumption for our [[inheritance]].
‘tis as epictetus says, that [[man]] has nothing properly his own, but the
use of his [[opinion]]; we have nothing but wind and smoke for our portion.
the gods have health in essence, says [[philosophy]], and sickness in
intelligence. [[man]], on the contrary, possesses his goods [[good]] by fancy, his
ills in essence. we have [[reason]] to magnify the [[power]] of our [[imagination]];
for all our goods [[good]] are only in [[dream]]. hear this [[poor]] calamitous animal
huff! “there is nothing,” says cicero, “so charming as the employment of
letters; of letters, i say, by means whereof the infinity of things, the
immense grandeur of [[nature]], the heavens [[heaven]] even in this [[world]], the [[earth]],
and the seas are discovered to us; ‘tis they that have taught us
religion, moderation, and the grandeur of [[courage]], and that have rescued
our souls [[soul]] from darkness, to make her see all things, high, low, first,
last, and middling; ‘tis they that furnish us wherewith to [[live]] happily
and well, and conduct us to pass over our lives [[life]] without displeasure, and
without offence.” does not this [[man]] seem to speak of the condition of
the ever-living and almighty [[god]]? but as to effects, a thousand little
countrywomen have lived lives [[life]] more [[equal]], more sweet, and constant than
his.


      deus ille fuit, deus, inclyte memmi,
   qui princeps vitæ rationem invenit earn, quæ
   nunc appellatur sapientia; quique per artem
   fluctibus è tantis vitam, tantisque tenebris,
   in tam tranquilla et tam clara luce locavit:

      “that [[god]], [[great]] memmus, was a [[god]] no doubt
   who, [[prince]] of [[life]], first found that [[reason]] out
   now [[wisdom]] called; and by his art [[arts]], who did
   that [[life]] in tempests tost, and darkness hid,
   place in so [[great]] a calm, and clear a [[light]]:”


here are brave ranting words; but a very slight accident put this man’s
understanding in a worse condition than that of the meanest shepherd,
notwithstanding this instructing [[god]], this [[divine]] [[wisdom]]. of the same
stamp and impudence is the promise of democritus’s [[book]]: “i am going to
speak of all things;” and that foolish title that [[aristotle]] prefixes
to one of his, order only afforded him a few lucid intervals which
he employed in composing his [[book]], and at [[last]] made him kill
himself,--eusebius’s chronicon.

of the mortal gods; and the [[judgment]] of chrysippus, that “dion was as
virtuous as [[god]];” and my seneca himself says, that “god had given him
life; but that to [[live]] well was his own;” conformably to this other: _in
virtute vere gloriamur; quod non contingeret, si id donum à deo, non à
nobis haberemus:_ “we truly [[glory]] in our [[virtue]]; which would not be,
if it was given us of [[god]], and not by ourselves;” this is also seneca’s
saying; “that the [[wise]] [[man]] hath fortitude [[equal]] with [[god]], but that his
is in spite of [[human]] frailty, wherein therefore he more than equals
god.” there is nothing so ordinary as to meet with sallies of the like
temerity; there is none of us, who take so much offence to see himself
equalled with [[god]], as he does to see himself undervalued by being ranked
with other creatures; so much more are we [[jealous]] of our own interest
than that of our creator.

but we must trample under foot this foolish vanity, and briskly and
boldly shake the ridiculous foundation upon which these false opinions
are founded. so long as [[man]] shall [[believe]] he has any means and [[power]] of
himself, he will never acknowledge what he owes to his maker; his eggs
shall always be chickens, as the saying is; we must therefore strip him
to his shirt. let us see some notable examples [[example]] of the effects of his
philosophy: posidonius being tormented with a disease so painful as made
him writhe his arms and gnash his teeth, [[thought]] he sufficiently scorned
the dolour, by crying out against it: “thou mayst do thy worst, i will
not confess that thou art [[arts]] an [[evil]].” he was as sensible of the [[pain]] as
my footman, but he made a bravado of bridling his tongue, at least,
and restraining it within the laws [[law]] of his sect: _re succumbere non
oportebat, verbis gloriantem._ “it did not become him, that spoke so
big, to confess his frailty when he came to the test.” arcesilas being
ill of the gout, and car-neades, who had come to see him, going away
troubled at his condition, he called him back, and showing him his feet
and breast: “there is nothing comes thence hither,” said he. this has
something a [[better]] grace, for he feels [[feel]] himself in [[pain]], and would be
disengaged from it; but his [[heart]], notwithstanding, is not conquered nor
subdued by it. the other stands more obstinately to his point, but, i
fear, rather verbally than really. and dionysius heracleotes, afflicted
with a vehement smarting in his [[eyes]], was reduced to quit these stoical
resolutions. but even though [[knowledge]] should, in effect, do as they
say, and could blunt the point, and dull the edge, of the misfortunes
that attend us, what does she, more than what ignorance does more purely
and evidently?--the philosopher pyrrho, being at sea in very great
danger, by [[reason]] of a mighty storm, presented nothing to the imitation
of those who were with him, in that extremity, but a hog they had on
board, that was fearless and unconcerned at the tempest. [[philosophy]],
when she has said all she can, refers us at [[last]] to the [[example]] of a
gladiator, wrestler, or muleteer, in which sort of [[people]] we commonly
observe much less apprehension of [[death]], sense of [[pain]], and other
inconveniences, and more of endurance, than ever [[knowledge]] furnished
any one withal, that was not bom and bred to hardship. what is the cause
that we make incisions, and cut the tender limbs of an infant, and those
of a horse, more easily than our own--but ignorance only? how many has
mere [[force]] of [[imagination]] made sick? we often see [[men]] cause themselves
to be let [[blood]], purged, and physicked, to be cured of diseases they
only [[feel]] in [[opinion]].--when real infirmities fail us, [[knowledge]] lends us
her’s; that colour, that [[complexion]], portend some catarrhous defluxion;
this hot season threatens us with a fever; this breach in the
life-line of your left hand gives you notice of some near and dangerous
indisposition; and at [[last]] she roundly attacks health itself; saying,
this sprightliness and vigour of [[youth]] cannot continue in this posture;
there must be [[blood]] taken, and the heat abated, lest it turn against
yourself. compare the [[life]] of a [[man]] subjected to such imaginations [[imagination]],
to that of a labourer that suffers himself to be [[led]] by his natural
appetite, measuring things only by the [[present]] sense, without [[knowledge]],
and without prognostic, that feels [[feel]] no [[pain]] or sickness, but when he is
really ill. whereas the other has the stone in his [[soul]], before he has
it in his bladder; as if it were not [[time]] enough to suffer the [[evil]] when
it shall come, he must anticipate it by fancy, and run to meet it.

what i say of physic may generally serve in [[example]] for all other
sciences. thence is derived that ancient [[opinion]] of the philosophers
that placed the [[sovereign]] [[good]] in the discovery of the weakness of our
judgment my ignorance affords me as much [[occasion]] of [[hope]] as of [[fear]];
and having no other [[rule]] for my health than that of the examples [[example]] of
others, and of events i see elsewhere upon the like [[occasion]], i find of
all sorts, and rely upon those which by comparison are most favourable
to me. i receive health with open arms, [[free]], full, and entire, and
by so much the more whet my appetite to enjoy it, by how much it is
at [[present]] less ordinary and more rare; so far am i from troubling its
repose and sweetness with the bitterness of a new and constrained manner
of living. beasts sufficiently show us how much the agitation of our
minds brings infirmities and diseases upon us. that which is told us of
those of brazil, that they never [[die]] but of old [[age]], is attributed to
the serenity and tranquillity of the air they [[live]] in; but i rather
attribute it to the serenity and tranquillity of their souls [[soul]], [[free]] from
all passion, [[thought]], or employment, extended or unpleasing, a people
that pass over their lives [[life]] in a wonderful simplicity and ignorance,
without letters, without [[law]], without [[king]], or any manner of [[religion]].
and whence comes that, which we find by [[experience]], that the heaviest
and dullest [[men]] are most able; and the most to be [[desired]] in amorous
performances; and that the [[love]] of a muleteer often renders itself more
acceptable than that of a gentleman, if it be not that the agitation
of the [[soul]] in the latter disturbs his physical ability, dissolves and
tires it, as it also ordinarily troubles and tires itself. what puts the
soul beside itself, and more usually throws it into madness, but her own
promptness, vigour, and agility, and, finally, her own proper [[force]]? of
what is the most subtle folly made, but of the most subtle [[wisdom]]? as
great friendships [[friendship]] spring from [[great]] enmities, and vigorous health from
mortal diseases, so from the rare and vivid agitations of our souls
proceed the most wonderful and most distracted frenzies; ‘tis but half
a turn of the toe from the one to the other. in the actions of madmen we
see how infinitely madness resembles the most vigorous operations of
the [[soul]]. who does not [[know]] how indiscernible the difference is betwixt
folly and the sprightly elevations of a [[free]] [[soul]], and the effects of a
supreme and extraordinary [[virtue]]? [[plato]] says that melancholy persons [[person]] are
the most capable of discipline, and the most excellent; and accordingly
in none is there so [[great]] a propension to madness. [[great]] wits are ruined
by their own proper [[force]] and pliability; into what a condition, through
his own agitation and promptness of fancy, is one of the most judicious,
ingenious, and nearest formed, of any other italian poet, to the air of
the ancient and true poesy, lately fallen! has he not vast obligation
to this vivacity that has destroyed him? to this [[light]] that has blinded
him? to this exact and subtle apprehension of [[reason]] that has put him
beside his own? to this [[curious]] and laborious search after sciences [[science]],
that has reduced him to imbecility? and to this rare aptitude to the
exercises of the [[soul]], that has rendered him without exercise and
without [[soul]]? i was more angry, if possible, than compassionate, to see
him at ferrara in so pitiful a condition surviving himself, forgetting
both himself and his works [[work]], which, without his [[knowledge]], though before
his face, have been published unformed and incorrect.

would you have a [[man]] healthy, would you have him regular, and in a
steady and secure posture? muffle him up in the shades of stupidity and
sloth. we must be made beasts to be made [[wise]], and hoodwinked before we
are fit to be [[led]]. and if one shall tell me that the advantage of having
a cold and dull sense of [[pain]] and other evils [[evil]], brings this disadvantage
along with it, to render us consequently less sensible also in the
fruition of [[good]] and [[pleasure]], this is true; but the misery of our
condition is such that we have not so much to enjoy as to avoid, and
that the extremest [[pleasure]] does not affect us to the [[degree]] that a
light [[grief]] does: _segnius homines bona quam mala sentiunt._ we are not
so sensible of the most [[perfect]] health as we are of the least sickness.


      pungit
   in cute vix sum ma violatum plagula corpus;
   quando valere nihil quemquam movet. hoc juvat unum,
   quod me non torquet latus, aut pes;
   cætera quisquam vix queat aut sanum sese, aut sentire valentem.

      “the [[body]] with a little sting is griev’d,
   when the most [[perfect]] health is not perceiv’d,
   this only pleases me, that spleen nor gout
   neither offend my side nor wring my foot;
   excepting these, scarce any one can tell,
   or e’er observes, when he’s in health and well.”


our well-being is nothing but the not being ill. which is the [[reason]] why
that sect of [[philosophers]], which sets the [[greatest]] value upon [[pleasure]],
has yet fixed it chiefly in unconsciousness of [[pain]]. to be freed from
ill is the [[greatest]] [[good]] that [[man]] can [[hope]] for or [[desire]]; as ennius
says,--


   nimium boni est, cui nihil est mali;


for that every tickling and sting which are in [[certain]] pleasures [[pleasure]], and
that seem to raise us above simple health and passiveness, that active,
moving, and, i [[know]] not how, itching, and biting [[pleasure]]; even that
very [[pleasure]] itself aims at nothing but insensibility as its mark. the
appetite that carries us headlong to women’s embraces has no other end
but only to cure the torment of our ardent and furious desires [[desire]], and only
requires to be glutted and laid at rest, and delivered from the fever.
and so of the rest. i say, then, that if simplicity conducts us to a
state [[free]] from [[evil]], she leads us to a very [[happy]] one according to our
condition. and yet we are not to imagine it so stupid an insensibility
as to be totally without sense; for crantor had very [[good]] [[reason]] to
controvert the insensibility of epicurus, if founded so deep that the
very first attack and birth of evils [[evil]] were not to be perceived: “i do not
approve such an insensibility as is neither possible nor to be [[desired]].
i am very well content not to be sick; but if i am, i would [[know]] that
i am so; and if a caustic be applied, or incisions made in any part, i
would [[feel]] them.” in [[truth]], whoever would take away the [[knowledge]] and
sense of [[evil]], would at the same [[time]] eradicate the sense of [[pleasure]],
and finally annihilate [[man]] himself: _istud nihil dolere, non sine magnâ
mercede contingit, immanitatis in animo, stuporis in corpore._ “an
insensibility that is not to be purchased but at the price of inhumanity
in the [[soul]], and of stupidity of the [[body]].” [[evil]] appertains to man
of course. neither is [[pain]] always to be avoided, nor [[pleasure]] always
pursued.

‘tis a [[great]] advantage to the [[honour]] of ignorance that [[knowledge]] itself
throws us into its arms, when she finds herself puzzled to fortify
us against the weight of [[evil]]; she is constrained to come to this
composition, to give us the reins, and permit us to fly into the lap
of the other, and to shelter ourselves under her protection from the
strokes and injuries of [[fortune]]. for what else is her meaning when she
instructs us to divert our thoughts [[thought]] from the ills that press upon us,
and entertain them with the meditation of pleasures [[pleasure]] [[past]] and gone; to
comfort ourselves in [[present]] afflictions with the remembrance of fled
delights, and to call to our succour a vanished satisfaction, to oppose
it to the discomfort that lies [[lie]] heavy upon us? _levationes ægritudinum
in avocatione a cogitandâ molestiâ, et revocation ad contemplandas
voluptates, ponit_; “he directs us to alleviate our [[grief]] and pains [[pain]] by
rejecting unpleasant thoughts [[thought]], and recalling agreeable ideas [[idea]];” if it be
not that where her [[power]] fails she would supply it with policy, and make
use of sleight of hand where [[force]] of limbs will not serve her turn? for
not only to a philosopher, but to any [[man]] in his [[right]] wits, when he has
upon him the thirst of a burning fever, what satisfaction can it be to
him to [[remember]] the [[pleasure]] he took in drinking [[greek]] wine a month ago?
it would rather only make matters worse to him:--


   che ricordarsi il ben doppia la noia.

   “the thinking of [[pleasure]] doubles trouble.”


of the same stamp is this other counsel that [[philosophy]] gives, only to
remember the [[happiness]] that is [[past]], and to forget the misadventures we
have undergone; as if we had the [[science]] of oblivion in our own [[power]],
and counsel, wherein we are yet no more to seek.


   suavis laborum est præteritorum ræmoria.

   “sweet is the memory of by-gone [[pain]].”


how does [[philosophy]], that should arm me to contend with [[fortune]], and
steel my [[courage]] to trample all [[human]] adversities under foot, arrive to
this [[degree]] of cowardice to make me hide my head at this rate, and save
myself by these pitiful and ridiculous shifts? for the memory represents
to us not what we choose, but what she pleases; nay, there is nothing
that so much imprints any thing in our memory as a [[desire]] to forget it.
and ‘tis a [[good]] way to retain and keep any thing safe in the [[soul]] to
solicit her to lose it. and this is false: _est situm in nobis, ut
et adversa quasi perpetua oblivione obruamus, et secunda jucunde et
suaviter meminerimus;_ “it is in our [[power]] to bury, as it were, in a
perpetual oblivion, all adverse accidents, and to retain a pleasant and
delightful memory of our successes;” and this is true: _memini etiam quo
nolo; oblivisci non possum quo volo._ “i do also [[remember]] what i would
not; but i cannot forget what i would.” and whose counsel is this? his,
_qui se unies sapiervtem profiteri sit ausus;_ “who alone durst profess
himself a [[wise]] [[man]].”


      qui genus humanum ingenio superavit, et omnes
   præstinxit stellas, exortus uti æthereus sol.

      “who from [[mankind]] the prize of [[knowledge]] won,
   and put the stars out like the rising sun.”


to empty and disfurnish the memory, is not this the true way to
ignorance?


   iners malorum remedium ignorantia est.

   “ignorance is but a dull remedy for evils [[evil]].”


we find several other like precepts, whereby we are permitted to borrow
frivolous appearances from the vulgar, where we find the strongest
reason will not [[answer]] the [[purpose]], provided they administer
satisfaction and comfort where they cannot cure the wound, they are
content to palliate and benumb it i [[believe]] they will not deny this,
that if they could add order and constancy in a [[state]] of [[life]] that could
maintain itself in ease and [[pleasure]] by some debility of [[judgment]], they
would accept it:--


      potare, et spargere flores
   incipiam, patiarque vel inconsultus haberi.

      “give me to drink, and, crown’d with flowers, despise
   the grave disgrace of being [[thought]] unwise.”


there would be a [[great]] many [[philosophers]] of lycas’s [[mind]] this [[man]], being
otherwise of very regular manners, living quietly and contentedly in his
family, and not failing in any office of his [[duty]], either towards his
own or strangers, and very carefully preserving himself from hurtful
things, became, nevertheless, by some distemper in his brain, possessed
with a conceit that he was perpetually in the theatre, a spectator of
the finest sights and the [[best]] comedies in the [[world]]; and being cured by
the physicians of his frenzy, was hardly prevented from endeavouring by
suit to compel them to restore him again to his pleasing [[imagination]]:--


      pol i me occidistis, amici,
   non servastis, ait; cui sic extorta voluptas,
   et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error;

      “by heaven! you’ve killed me, [[friends]], outright,
   and not preserved me; since my dear delight
   and pleasing error, by my [[better]] sense
   unhappily return’d, is [[banished]] hence;”


with a madness like that of thrasylaus the [[son]] of pythodorus, who made
himself [[believe]] that all the ships that weighed anchor from the port of
piræus, and that came into the haven, only made their voyages for
his [[profit]]; congratulating them upon their successful navigation, and
receiving them with the [[greatest]] joy; and when his [[brother]] crito caused
him to be restored to his [[better]] understanding, he infinitely regretted
that sort of condition wherein he had lived with so much delight and
free from all [[anxiety]] of [[mind]]. ‘tis according to the old [[greek]] verse,
that “there is a [[great]] deal of convenience in not being over-wise.”

and ecclesiastes, “in much [[wisdom]] there is much [[sorrow]];” and “who gets
wisdom gets [[labour]] and trouble.”

even that to which [[philosophy]] consents in general, that [[last]] remedy
which she applies to all sorts of necessities, to put an end to the life
we are not able to endure. _placet?--pare. non placet?--quâcumque vis,
exi. pungit dolor?--vel fodiat sane. si nudus es, da jugulum; [[sin]] tectus
armis vulcaniis, id est fortitudine, résisté;_ “does it please?--obey
it. not please?--go where thou wilt. does [[grief]] prick thee,--nay, stab
thee?--if thou art [[arts]] naked, [[present]] thy throat; if covered with the arms
of vulcan, that is, fortitude, resist it.” and this word, so used in
the [[greek]] festivals, _aut bibat, aut abeat,_ “either drink or go,” which
sounds [[better]] upon the tongue of a gascon, who naturally changes [[change]] the h
into v, than on that of cicero:--


      vivere si recte nescis, decede peritis.
   lusisti satis, edisti satis, atque bibisti;
   tempus abire tibi est, ne potum largius æquo
   rideat et pulset lasciva decentius ætas.

      “if to [[live]] well and [[right]] thou dost not [[know]],
   give way, and leave thy place to those that do.
   thou’st eaten, drunk, and play’d to thy content,
   ‘tis [[time]] to make thy parting compliment,
   lest [[youth]], more decent in their follies, scoff
   the nauseous scene, and hiss thee reeling off;”


what is it other than a [[confession]] of his impotency, and a sending back
not only to ignorance, to be there in safety, but even to stupidity,
insensibility, and nonentity?


      democritum postquam matura vetustas
   admonuit memorem motus languescere mentis;
   sponte sua letho caput obvius obtulit ipse.

      “soon as, through [[age]], democritus did find
   a manifest decadence in his [[mind]],
   he [[thought]] he now surviv’d to his own [[wrong]],
   and went to meet his [[death]], that stay’d too long.”


‘tis what antisthenes said, “that a [[man]] should either make provision
of sense to [[understand]], or of a halter to hang himself;” and what
chrysippus alleged upon this saying of the poet tyrtæus:--


   “or to arrive at [[virtue]] or at [[death]];”


and crates said, “that [[love]] would be cured by [[hunger]], if not by [[time]];
and whoever disliked these two remedies, by a rope.” that sextius, of
whom both seneca and plutarch speak with so high an encomium, having
applied himself, all other things set aside, to the study of [[philosophy]],
resolved to throw himself into the sea, seeing the [[progress]] of his
studies too tedious and slow. he ran to find [[death]], since he could not
overtake [[knowledge]]. these are the words of the [[law]] upon the [[subject]]:
“if peradventure some [[great]] inconvenience happen, for which there is no
remedy, the haven is near, and a [[man]] may save himself by swimming out
of his [[body]] as out of a leaky skiff; for ‘tis the [[fear]] of dying, and not
the [[love]] of [[life]], that ties the [[fool]] to his [[body]].”

as [[life]] renders itself by simplicity more pleasant, so more innocent
and [[better]], also it renders it as i was saying before: “the simple
and ignorant,” says st. paul, “raise themselves up to [[heaven]] and take
possession of it; and we, with all our [[knowledge]], plunge ourselves into
the infernal abyss.” i am neither swayed by valentinian, a professed
enemy to all learning and letters, nor by licinius, both roman emperors [[emperor]],
who called them the poison and pest of all [[political]] [[government]]; nor by
mahomet, who, as ‘tis said, interdicted all manner of learning to his
followers; but the [[example]] of the [[great]] lycurgus, and his [[authority]],
with the reverence of the [[divine]] lacedemonian policy, so [[great]], so
admirable, and so long flourishing in [[virtue]] and [[happiness]], without any
institution or practice of letters, ought certainly to be of very great
weight. such as return from the new [[world]] discovered by the spaniards
in our fathers’ days, testify to us how much more honestly and regularly
those nations [[live]], without magistrate and without [[law]], than ours do,
where there are more officers and lawyers than there are of other sorts
of [[men]] and [[business]]:--


      di cittatorie piene, e di libelli,
   d’esamine, e di carte di procure,
   hanno le mani e il seno, e gran fastelli
   di chioge, di consigli, et di letture:
   per cui le faculta de* poverelli
   non sono mai nelle città sicure;
   hanno dietro e dinanzi, e d’ambi i lati,
   notai, procuratori, ed avvocati.

      “their bags were full of writs, and of citations,
   of process, and of actions and arrests,
   of bills, of answers [[answer]], and of replications,
   in courts of delegates, and of requests,
   to grieve the simple sort with [[great]] vexations;
   they had resorting to them as their guests,
   attending on their circuit, and their journeys,
   scriv’ners, and clerks, and lawyers, and attorneys.”


it was what a roman senator of the latter ages [[age]] said, that their
predecessors’ breath stunk of garlic, but their stomachs were perfumed
with a [[good]] [[conscience]]; and that, on the contrary, those of his time
were all sweet odour without, but stunk within of all sorts of vices [[vice]];
that is to say, as i interpret it, that they abounded with learning
and eloquence, but were very defective in [[moral]] honesty. incivility,
ignorance, simplicity, roughness, are the [[natural]] companions of
innocence; curiosity, subtlety, [[knowledge]], bring malice in their train;
humility, [[fear]], [[obedience]], and affability, which are the principal
things that support and maintain [[human]] [[society]], require an empty and
docile [[soul]], and little presuming upon itself.

christians have a particular [[knowledge]], how [[natural]] and original an evil
curiosity is in [[man]]; the thirst of [[knowledge]], and the [[desire]] to
become more [[wise]], was the first ruin of [[man]], and the way by which he
precipitated himself into eternal damnation. [[pride]] was his ruin and
corruption. ‘tis [[pride]] that diverts him from the [[common]] path, and makes
him embrace novelties, and rather choose to be head of a troop, lost and
wandering in the path of error; to be a master and a teacher of lies [[lie]],
than to be a disciple in the school of [[truth]], suffering himself to be
led and guided by the hand of another, in the [[right]] and beaten
road. ‘tis, peradventure, the meaning of this old [[greek]] saying, that
superstition follows [[pride]], and obeys it as if it were a [[father]]:
[--greek--] ah, presumption, how much dost thou hinder us?

after that [[socrates]] was told that the [[god]] of [[wisdom]] had assigned to him
the title of sage, he was astonished at it, and, searching and examining
himself throughout, could find no foundation for this [[divine]] [[judgment]].
he knew others as just, temperate, valiant, and learned, as himself; and
more eloquent, more handsome, and more profitable to their [[country]] than
he. at [[last]] he concluded that he was not distinguished from others, nor
wise, but only because he did not [[think]] himself so; and that his god
considered the [[opinion]] of [[knowledge]] and [[wisdom]] as a singular absurdity
in [[man]]; and that his [[best]] doctrine was the doctrine of ignorance, and
simplicity his [[best]] [[wisdom]]. the [[sacred]] word declares those miserable
among us who have an [[opinion]] of themselves: “dust and ashes,” says it
to such, “what hast thou wherein to glorify thyself?” and, in another
place, “god has made [[man]] like unto a shadow,” of whom who can [[judge]],
when by removing the [[light]] it shall be vanished! [[man]] is a thing of
nothing.

our [[force]] is so far from being able to comprehend the [[divine]] height,
that, of the works [[work]] of our creator, those [[best]] bear his mark, and are
with [[better]] title his, which we the least [[understand]]. to meet with an
incredible thing is an [[occasion]] to christians [[christian]] to [[believe]]; and it is
so much the more according to [[reason]], by how much it is against human
reason. if it were according to [[reason]], it would be no more a miracle;
and if it were according to [[example]], it would be no longer a singular
thing. _melius scitur deus nesdendo_: “god is [[better]] known by not
knowing him,” says st. austin: and tacitus, _sanctius est ac reverentius
de actis deorum credere, quam scire_; “it is more holy and reverent to
believe the works [[work]] of [[god]] than to [[know]] them;” and [[plato]] thinks [[think]] there is
something of impiety in inquiring too curiously into [[god]], the [[world]],
and the first causes of things: _atque illum quidem parentem hujus
universitaiis invenire, difficile; et, quum jam inveneris, indicare in
vulgtis, nefas_: “to find out the parent of the [[world]] is very difficult;
and when found out, to reveal him to the vulgar is [[sin]],” says cicero. we
talk indeed of [[power]], [[truth]], [[justice]]; which are words that signify some
great thing; but that thing we neither see nor conceive at all. we say
that [[god]] fears [[fear]], that [[god]] is angry, that [[god]] loves [[love]],


   immortalia mortali sermone notantes:

   “giving to things [[immortal]] mortal names.”


these are all agitations and emotions that cannot be in [[god]], according
to our form, nor can we imagine them, according to his. it only belongs
to [[god]] to [[know]] himself, and to interpret his own works [[work]]; and he does it
in our [[language]], going out of himself, to stoop to us who grovel upon
the [[earth]]. how can prudence, which is the [[choice]] between [[good]] and [[evil]],
be properly attributed to him whom no [[evil]] can touch? how can reason
and [[intelligence]], which we make use of, to arrive by obscure at apparent
things; seeing that nothing is obscure to him? how [[justice]], which
distributes to every one what appertains to him, a thing begot by the
society and [[community]] of [[men]], how is that in [[god]]? how temperance, which
is the moderation of corporal pleasures [[pleasure]], that have no place in the
divinity? fortitude to support [[pain]], [[labour]], and dangers, as little
appertains to him as the rest; these three things have no access to
him. for which [[reason]] [[aristotle]] holds him equally exempt from virtue
and [[vice]]: _neque gratia, neque ira teneri potest; quod quo talia essent,
imbecilla essent omnia?_ “he can neither be affected with favour nor
indignation, because both these are the effects of frailty.”

the participation we have in the [[knowledge]] of [[truth]], such as it is,
is not acquired by our own [[force]]: [[god]] has sufficiently given us to
understand that, by the witnesses he has chosen out of the common
people, simple and ignorant [[men]], that he has been pleased to employ
to instruct us in his admirable secrets. our [[faith]] is not of our
own acquiring; ‘tis purely the gift of another’s bounty: ‘tis not by
meditation, or by [[virtue]] of our own understanding, that we have
acquired our [[religion]], but by [[foreign]] [[authority]] and command wherein the
imbecility of our own [[judgment]] does more assist us than any [[force]] of it;
and our blindness more than our clearness of sight: ‘tis more by__ the
mediation of our ignorance than of our [[knowledge]] that we [[know]] any thing
of the [[divine]] [[wisdom]]. ‘tis no wonder if our [[natural]] and earthly parts
cannot conceive that supernatural and heavenly [[knowledge]]: let us bring
nothing of our own, but [[obedience]] and subjection; for, as it is written,
“i will [[destroy]] the [[wisdom]] of the [[wise]], and will bring to nothing the
understanding of the prudent. where is the [[wise]]? where is the scribe?
where is the disputer of this [[world]]? hath not [[god]] made foolish the
wisdom of this [[world]]? for after that, in the [[wisdom]] of [[god]], the world
knew not [[god]], it pleased [[god]] by the foolishness of preaching to save
them that [[believe]].”

finally, should i examine whether it be in the [[power]] of [[man]] to find out
that which he seeks and if that quest, wherein he has busied himself so
many ages [[age]], has enriched him with any new [[force]], or any solid [[truth]]; i
believe he will confess, if he speaks from his [[conscience]], that all
he has got by so long inquiry is only to have learned to [[know]] his
own weakness. we have only by a long study confirmed and verified the
natural ignorance we were in before. the same has fallen out to men
truly [[wise]], which befalls the ears of corn; they shoot and raise their
heads high and pert, whilst empty; but when full and swelled with grain
in maturity, begin to flag and droop. so [[men]], having tried and sounded
all things, and having found in that mass of [[knowledge]], and provision of
so many various things, nothing solid and firm, and nothing but
vanity, have quitted their presumption, and acknowledged their natural
condition. ‘tis what velleius reproaches cotta withal and cicero, “that
they had learned of philo, that they had learned nothing.” pherecydes,
one of the seven sages, writing to thales upon his death-bed; “i have,”
 said he, “given order to my [[people]], after my interment, to carry my
writings to thee. if they please thee and the other sages, publish; if
not, suppress them. they contain no certainty with which i myself am
satisfied. neither do i pretend to [[know]] the [[truth]], or to attain to it.
i rather open than discover things.” the wisest [[man]] that ever was, being
asked what he knew, made [[answer]], “he knew this, that he knew nothing.”
 by which he verified what has been said, that the [[greatest]] part of what
we [[know]] is the least of what we do not; that is to say, that even
what we [[think]] we [[know]] is but a piece, and a very little one, of our
ignorance. we [[know]] things in dreams [[dream]], says [[plato]], and are ignorant of
them in [[truth]]. _ormes pene veteres nihil cognosci, nihil percipi,
nihil sciri posse dixerunt; angustos sensus, imbecilles animos, brevia
curricula vito._ “almost all the ancients have declared that there is
nothing to be known, nothing to be perceived or understood; the senses
are too limited, [[men’s]] minds [[mind]] too [[weak]], and the course of [[life]] too short.”
 and of cicero himself, who stood indebted to his learning for all he
was worth, valerius says, “that he began to disrelish letters in his old
age; and when at his studies, it was with [[great]] independency upon any
one party; following what he [[thought]] probable, now in one sect, and
then in another, evermore wavering under the doubts [[doubt]] of the academy.”
 _dicendum est, sed ita ut nihil affirment, quceram omnia, dubitans
plerumque, et mihi diffidens._ “something i must say, but so as to
affirm nothing; i inquire into all things, but for the most part in
doubt and distrust of myself.”

i should have too [[fair]] a game should i consider [[man]] in his [[common]] way of
living and in gross; yet i might do it by his own [[rule]], who judges [[judge]] truth
not by weight, but by the number of votes. let us set the [[people]] aside,


      qui vigilans stertit,....
   mortua cui vita est prope jam vivo atque videnti;

     “half of his [[life]] by lazy sleep’s possess’d,
   and when awake his [[soul]] but nods at [[best]];”


who neither [[feel]] nor [[judge]], and let most of their [[natural]] faculties lie
idle; i will take [[man]] in his highest ground. let us consider him in
that little number of [[men]], excellent and culled out from the rest, who,
having been endowed with a remarkable and particular [[natural]] [[force]], have
moreover hardened and whetted it by [[care]], study, and art [[arts]], and raised
it to the highest pitch of [[wisdom]] to which it can possibly arrive. they
have adjusted their souls [[soul]] to all ways and all biases; have propped and
supported them with all [[foreign]] helps proper for them, and enriched and
adorned them with all they could borrow for their advantage, both within
and without the [[world]]; ‘tis in these is placed the utmost and most
supreme height to which [[human]] [[nature]] can attain. they have regulated
the [[world]] with policies and laws [[law]]. they have instructed it with [[arts]] and
sciences, and by the [[example]] of their admirable manners. i shall make
account of none but such [[men]] as these, their testimony and [[experience]].
let us examine how far they have proceeded, and where they stopped. the
errors and defects that we shall find amongst these [[men]] the [[world]] may
boldly avow as their own.

whoever goes in search of any thing must come to this, either to say
that he has found it, or that it is not to be found, or that he is yet
upon the search. all [[philosophy]] is divided into these three kinds [[kind]]; her
design is to seek out [[truth]], [[knowledge]], and certainty. the peripatetics,
epicureans, stoics, and others, have [[thought]] they have found it. these
established the sciences [[science]] we have, and have treated of them as of certain
knowledge. clitomachus, carneades, and the academics, have despaired
in their search, and concluded that [[truth]] could not be conceived by our
understandings. the result of these is weakness and [[human]] ignorance.
this sect has had the most and the most [[noble]] followers. pyrrho, and
other skeptics or epechists, whose dogmas are held by many of the
ancients to be taken from [[homer]], the seven sages, and from archilochus
and euripides, and to whose number these are added, zeno, democritus,
and xenophanes, say that they are yet upon the inquiry after [[truth]].
these conclude that the others, who [[think]] they have found it out, are
infinitely deceived; and that it is too daring a vanity in the second
sort to determine that [[human]] [[reason]] is not able to attain unto it;
for this establishing a standard of our [[power]], to [[know]] and [[judge]] the
difficulty of things, is a [[great]] and extreme [[knowledge]], of which they
doubt whether [[man]] is capable:--


      nil sciri quisquis putat, id quoque nescit,
   an sciri possit; quam se nil scire fatetur.

      “he that says nothing can be known, o’erthrows
   his own [[opinion]], for he nothing knows [[know]],
   so knows [[know]] not that.”


the ignorance that knows [[know]] itself, judges [[judge]] and condemns itself, is not an
absolute ignorance; to be such, it must be ignorant of itself; so that
the profession of the pyrrhonians is to waver, [[doubt]], and inquire, not
to make themselves sure of, or responsible to themselves for any
thing. of the three actions of the [[soul]], imaginative, appetitive, and
consentive, they receive the two first; the [[last]] they kept ambiguous,
without inclination or approbation, either of one thing or another,
so [[light]] as it is. zeno represented the motion of his [[imagination]] upon
these divisions of the faculties of the [[soul]] thus: “an open and expanded
hand signified appearance; a hand half shut, and the fingers a little
bending, [[consent]]; a clenched fist, comprehension; when with the left
he yet thrust the [[right]] fist closer, [[knowledge]].” now this situation of
their [[judgment]] upright and inflexible, receiving all objects without
application or [[consent]], leads them to their ataraxy, which is a
peaceable condition of [[life]], temperate, and exempt from the agitations
we receive by the impression of [[opinion]] and [[knowledge]] that we [[think]] we
have of things; whence spring [[fear]], avarice, envy, immoderate desires [[desire]],
ambition, [[pride]], superstition, [[love]] of novelty, rebellion, disobedience,
obstinacy, and the [[greatest]] part of bodily ills; nay, and by that they
are exempt from the [[jealousy]] of their discipline; for they debate after
a very gentle manner; they [[fear]] no requital in their disputes; when they
affirm that heavy things descend they would be [[sorry]] to be believed,
and [[love]] tobe contradicted, to engender [[doubt]] and suspense of [[judgment]],
which is their end. they only put forward their propositions to
contend with those they [[think]] we have in our [[belief]]. if you take their
arguments, they will as readily maintain the contrary; ‘tis all one to
them, they have no [[choice]]. if you maintain that snow is black, they will
argue on the contrary that it is [[white]]; if you say it is neither the
one nor the other, they will maintain that it is both. if you hold, of
certain [[judgment]], that you [[know]] nothing, they will maintain that you do.
yea, and if by an affirmative axiom you assure them that you [[doubt]], they
will argue against you that you [[doubt]] not; or that you cannot [[judge]] and
determine that you [[doubt]]. and by this extremity of [[doubt]], which jostles
itself, they separate and divide themselves from many opinions [[opinion]], even
of those they have several ways maintained, both concerning [[doubt]] and
ignorance. “why shall not they be allowed to [[doubt]],” say they, “as well
as the dogmatists, one of whom says green, another yellow? can any thing
be proposed to us to grant, or deny, which it shall not be permitted to
consider as ambiguous?” and where others are carried away, either by
the custom of their [[country]], or by the instruction of parents, or by
accident, as by a tempest, without [[judgment]] and without [[choice]], nay,
and for the most part before the [[age]] of discretion, to such and such
an [[opinion]], to the sect whether stoic or epicurean, with which they
are prepossessed, enslaved, and fast bound, as to a thing they cannot
forsake: _ad quamcumque disciplinant, velut tempestate, delati, ad earn,
tanquam ad saxum, adhorescunt;_ “every one cleaves to the doctrine he
has happened upon, as to a rock against which he has been thrown by
tempest;” why shall not these likewise be permitted to maintain their
liberty, and consider things without obligation or [[slavery]]? _hoc
liberiores et solutiores, quod integra illis est judicandi potestas_:
“in this more unconstrained and [[free]], because they have the greater
power of judging.” is it not of some advantage to be disengaged from the
necessity that curbs others? is it not [[better]] to remain in suspense than
to entangle one’s [[self]] in the innumerable errors that [[human]] fancy has
produced? is it not much [[better]] to suspend one’s persuasion than to
intermeddle with these wrangling and seditious divisions: “what shall
i choose?” “what you please, provided you will choose.” a very foolish
answer; but such a one, nevertheless, as all dogmatism seems to point
at, and by which we are not permitted to be ignorant of what we are
ignorant of.

take the most eminent side, that of the [[greatest]] [[reputation]]; it will
never be so sure that you shall not be forced to attack and contend with
a hundred and a hundred adversaries to defend it. is it not [[better]] to
keep out of this hurly-burly? you are permitted to embrace aristotle’s
opinions of the immortality of the [[soul]] with as much zeal as your honour
and [[life]], and to give the [[lie]] to [[plato]] thereupon, and shall they be
interdicted to [[doubt]] him? if it be lawful for panætius to maintain
his [[opinion]] about augury, dreams [[dream]], oracles, vaticinations, of which the
stoics made no [[doubt]] at all; why may not a [[wise]] [[man]] dare to do the
same in all things that he dared to do in those he had learned of his
masters, established by the [[common]] [[consent]] of the school, whereof he
is a professor and a member? if it be a child that judges [[judge]], he knows [[know]] not
what it is; if a [[wise]] [[man]], he is prepossessed. they have reserved for
themselves a marvellous advantage in [[battle]], having eased themselves of
the [[care]] of defence. if you strike them, they [[care]] not, provided
they strike too, and they turn every thing to their own use. if they
overcome, your argument is lame; if you, theirs; if they fall short,
they verify ignorance; if you fall short, you do it; if they prove that
nothing is known, ‘tis well; if they cannot prove it, ‘tis also well:
_ut quurn in eadem re paria contrariis in partibus momenta inveniuntur,
facilius ab utraque parte assertio sustineatur:_ “that when like
sentiments happen _pro_ and _con_ in the same thing, the assent may on
both sides be more easily suspended.” and they make account to find out,
with much greater facility, why a thing is false, than why ‘tis true;
that which is not, than that which is; and what they do not [[believe]],
than what they do. their way of speaking is: “i assert nothing; it is no
more so than so, or than neither one nor t’other; i [[understand]] it not.
appearances are everywhere [[equal]]; the [[law]] of speaking, _pro_ or _con_,
is the same. nothing seems true, that may not seem false.” their
sacramental word is that is to say, “i hold, i stir not.” this is the
burden of their [[song]], and others of like stuff. the effect of which is
a pure, entire, [[perfect]], and absolute suspension of [[judgment]]. they make
use of their [[reason]] to inquire and debate, but not to fix and determine.
whoever shall imagine a perpetual [[confession]] of ignorance, a judgment
without bias, propension, or inclination, upon any [[occasion]] whatever,
conceives a true [[idea]] of pyrrhonism. i express this fancy as well as
i can, by [[reason]] that many find it hard to conceive, and the authors
themselves represent it a little variously and obscurely.

as to what concerns the actions of [[life]], they are in this of the
common [[fashion]]. they yield and give up themselves to their natural
inclinations, to the [[power]] and impulse of [[passions]], to the constitution
of laws [[law]] and customs, and to the tradition of [[arts]]; _non enim nos deus
ista scire, sed tantummodo uti, voluit._ “for [[god]] would not have us
know, but only use those things.” they suffer their ordinary actions to
be guided by those things, without any dispute or [[judgment]]. for
which [[reason]] i cannot [[consent]] to what is said of pyrrho, by those
who represent him heavy and immovable, leading a [[kind]] of savage and
unsociable [[life]], standing the jostle of carts, going upon the edge of
precipices, and refusing to accommodate himself to the laws [[law]]. this is to
enhance upon his discipline; he would never make himself a stock or
a stone, he would show himself a living [[man]], discoursing, reasoning,
enjoying all reasonable conveniences and pleasures [[pleasure]], employing and making
use of all his corporal and [[spiritual]] faculties in [[rule]] and [[reason]].
the fantastic, imaginary, and false privileges [[privilege]] that [[man]] had usurped
of lording it, ordaining, and establishing, he has utterly quitted and
renounced. yet there is no sect but is constrained to permit her sage to
follow several things not comprehended, perceived, or consented to, if
he means to [[live]]. and if he goes to sea, he follows that design, not
knowing whether his [[voyage]] shall be successful or no; and only insists
upon the tightness of the vessel, the [[experience]] of the pilot, and the
convenience of the season, and such probable circumstances; after which
he is bound to go, and suffer himself to be governed by appearances,
provided there be no express and manifest contrariety in them. he has a
body, he has a [[soul]]; the senses push them, the [[mind]] spurs them on. and
although he does not find in himself this proper and singular sign of
judging, and that he perceives that he ought not to engage his
consent, considering that there may be some false, [[equal]] to these true
appearances, yet does he not, for all that, fail of carrying on the
offices of his [[life]] with [[great]] [[liberty]] and convenience. how many arts
are there that profess to consist more in conjecture than [[knowledge]];
that decide not on true and false, and only [[follow]] that which seems so!
there are, say they, true and false, and we have in us wherewith to seek
it; but not to make it stay when we touch it. we are much more prudent,
in letting ourselves be regulated by the order of the [[world]], without
inquiry. a [[soul]] clear from prejudice has a marvellous advance towards
tranquillity and repose. [[men]] that [[judge]] and control their judges [[judge]], do
never duly submit to them.

how much more docile and easy to be governed, both by the laws [[law]] of
religion and civil polity, are simple and incurious minds [[mind]], than those
over-vigilant wits, that will still be prating of [[divine]] and human
causes! there is nothing in [[human]] invention that carries so [[great]] a show
of likelihood and utility as this; this presents [[present]] [[man]], naked and empty,
confessing his [[natural]] weakness, fit to receive some [[foreign]] [[force]] from
above, unfurnished of [[human]], and therefore more apt to receive into him
the [[divine]] [[knowledge]], making nought of his own [[judgment]], to give more
room to [[faith]]; neither disbelieving nor establishing any dogma against
common observances; humble, [[obedient]], disciplinable, and studious; a
sworn [[enemy]] of heresy; and consequently freeing himself from [[vain]] and
irreligious opinions [[opinion]], introduced by false sects. ‘tis a blank paper
prepared to receive such forms from the finger of [[god]] as he shall please
to write upon it. the more we resign and commit ourselves to [[god]], and
the more we renounce ourselves, of the greater value we are. “take in
good part,” says ecclesiastes, “the things that [[present]] themselves to
thee, as they seem and taste from hand to mouth; the rest is out of thy
knowledge.” _dominus novit cogitationes hominum, quoniam vanæ sunt_:
“the [[lord]] knoweth the hearts [[heart]] of [[men]], that they are but vanity.”

thus we see that of the three general sects of [[philosophy]], two make open
profession of [[doubt]] and ignorance; and in that of the dogmatists, which
is the third, it is easy to discover that the [[greatest]] part of them only
assume this face of confidence and assurance that

they may [[produce]] the [[better]] effect; they have not so much thought
to establish any certainty for us, as to show us how far they have
proceeded in their search of [[truth]]: _quam docti jingunt magis quam
nôrunt_: “which the learned rather feign than [[know]].” timæus, being
to instruct [[socrates]] in what he knew of the gods, the [[world]], and [[men]],
proposes to speak to him as a [[man]] to a [[man]]; and that it is sufficient,
if his reasons [[reason]] are probable as those of another; for that exact
reasons were neither in his nor any other mortal hand; which one of
his followers has thus imitated: _ut potero, explicabo: nec tamen, ut
pythius [[apollo]], certa ut sint et fixa quæ dixero; sed, ut homunculus,
probabilia conjecturâ sequens:_ “i will, as well as i am able, explain;
affirming, yet not as the pythian oracle, that what i say is fixed and
certain, but like a mere [[man]], that follows probabilities by conjecture.”
 and this, upon the [[natural]] and [[common]] [[subject]] of the contempt of [[death]];
he has elsewhere translated from the very words of [[plato]]: _si forte, de
deorum naturâ ortuque mundi disserentes, minus id quod habemiis in animo
consequi-mur, haud erit mirum; oquum est enim meminisse, et me, qui
disseram, hominem esse, et vos, qui judicetis, ut, si probabilia
dicentur, nihil ultra requiratis?_ “if perchance, when we discourse
of the [[nature]] of [[god]], and the world’s original, we cannot do it as we
desire, it will be no [[great]] wonder. for it is just you should remember
that both i who speak and you who are to [[judge]], are [[men]]; so that if
probable things are delivered, you shall require and expect no more.”
 [[aristotle]] ordinarily heaps up a [[great]] number of other [[men’s]] opinions [[opinion]] and
beliefs, to compare them with his own, and to let us see how much he has
gone beyond them, and how much nearer he approaches to the likelihood of
truth; for [[truth]] is not to be judged by the [[authority]] and testimony
of others; which made epicurus religiously avoid quoting them in his
writings. this is the [[prince]] of all dogmatists, and yet we are told by
him that the more we [[know]] the more we have room for [[doubt]]. in earnest,
we sometimes see him shroud and muffle up himself in so thick and so
inextricable an obscurity that we [[know]] not what to make of his [[advice]];
it is, in effect, a pyrrhonism under a resolutive form. hear cicero’s
protestation, who expounds to us another’s fancy by his own: _qui
requirunt quid de quâque re ipsi sentiamus, curiosius id faciunt quam
necesse est,... hoc in philosophiâ ratio, contra omnia disserendi,
nuttamque rem aperte judicandi, profecta a socrate, repetita
ab arcesila, conjirmata a gameade, usquê ad nostram viget
cetatem..........hi sumus, qui omnibus veris falsa quodam adjuncta esse
dicamus, tanta similitudine, ut in iis nulla insit certe judicandi et
assentiendi nota._ “they who [[desire]] to [[know]] what we [[think]] of every
thing are therein more inquisitive than is necessary. this practice
in [[philosophy]] of disputing against every thing, and of absolutely
concluding nothing, begun by [[socrates]], repeated by arcesilaus, and
confirmed by cameades, has continued in use even to our own times [[time]]. we
are they who declare that there is so [[great]] a mixture of things false
amongst all that are true, and they so resemble one another, that there
can be in them no [[certain]] mark to direct us either to [[judge]] or assent.”
 why hath not [[aristotle]] only, but most of the [[philosophers]], affected
difficulty, if not to set a greater value upon the vanity of the
subject, and amuse the curiosity of our minds [[mind]] by giving them this hollow
and fleshless bone to pick? clitomachus affirmed “that he could never
discover by carneades’s writings what [[opinion]] he was of.” this was it
that made epicurus affect to be abstruse, and that procured heraclitus
the epithet of [--greek--] difficulty is a coin the learned make use
of, like jugglers, to conceal the vanity of their art [[arts]], and which human
sottishness easily takes for current [[pay]].


      claras, ob obscuram linguam, magis inter manes...
   omnia enim stolidi magis admirantur amantque
   inversis quæ sub verbis latitantia cemunt.

      “bombast and riddle [[best]] do puppies please,
   for fools [[fool]] [[admire]] and [[love]] such things as these;
   and a dull quibble, wrapt in dubious phrase,
   up to the height doth their [[wise]] wonder raise.”


cicero reprehends some of his [[friends]] for giving more of their time
to the study of astrology, [[logic]], and geometry, than they were really
worth; saying that they were by these diverted from the duties [[duty]] of [[life]],
and more profitable and proper studies. the cyrenaick [[philosophers]], in
like manner, despised physics and [[logic]]. zeno, in the very beginning of
the books [[book]] of the commonwealth, declared all the liberal [[arts]] of no use.
chrysippus said “that what [[plato]] and [[aristotle]] had writ, concerning
logic, they had only done in [[sport]], and by way of exercise;” and could
not [[believe]] that they spoke in earnest of so [[vain]] a thing. plutarch
says the same of metaphysics. and epicurus would have said as much
of rhetoric, grammar, poetry, mathematics, and, [[natural]] philosophy
excepted, of all the sciences [[science]]; and [[socrates]] of them all, excepting that
which treats of manners and of [[life]]. whatever any one required to be
instructed in, by him, he would ever, in the first place, demand
an account of the conditions of his [[life]] [[present]] and [[past]], which he
examined and judged, esteeming all other learning subsequent to that
and supernumerary: _parum mihi placeant eæ littero quo ad virtutem
doctoribus nihil pro-fuerunt._ “that learning is in small repute with me
which nothing profited the teachers themselves to [[virtue]].” most of the
arts have been in like manner decried by the same [[knowledge]]; but they
did not consider that it was from the [[purpose]] to exercise their wits in
those very matters wherein there was no solid advantage.

as to the rest, some have looked upon [[plato]] as a dogmatist, others as a
doubter, others in some things the one, and in other things the other.
socrates, the conductor of his dialogues, is eternally upon questions
and stirring up disputes, never determining, never satisfying, and
professes to have no other [[science]] but that of opposing himself. [[homer]],
their author, has equally laid the foundations of all the sects of
philosophy, to show how indifferent it was which way we should choose.
‘tis said that ten several sects sprung from [[plato]]; yet, in my [[opinion]],
never did any instruction halt and stumble, if his does not.

socrates said that midwives, in taking upon them the [[trade]] of helping
others to bring forth, left the [[trade]] of bringing forth themselves; and
that by the title of a [[wise]] [[man]] or sage, which the gods had conferred
upon him, he was disabled, in his virile and mental [[love]], of the faculty
of bringing forth, contenting himself to [[help]] and assist those that
could; to open their [[nature]], anoint the passes, and facilitate their
birth; to [[judge]] of the infant, baptize, nourish, fortify, swath, and
circumcise it, exercising and employing his understanding in the perils
and fortunes [[fortune]] of others.

it is so with the most part of this third sort of authors, as the
ancients have observed in the writings of anaxagoras, democritus,
parmenides, xenophanes, and others. they have a way of writing, doubtful
in substance and design, rather inquiring than teaching, though they mix
their style with some dogmatical periods. is not the same thing seen in
seneca and plutarch? how many contradictions are there to be found if a
man pry narrowly into them! so many that the reconciling lawyers ought
first to reconcile them every one to themselves. [[plato]] seems to have
affected this method of philosophizing in dialogues; to the end that he
might with greater decency, from several mouths, deliver the diversity
and variety of his own fancies. it is as well to treat variously of
things as to treat of them conformably, and [[better]], that is to say, more
copiously and with greater [[profit]]. let us take [[example]] from ourselves:
judgments are the utmost point of all dogmatical and determinative
speaking; and yet those _arrets_ that our parliaments give the [[people]],
the most exemplary of them, and those most proper to nourish in them the
reverence due to that [[dignity]], principally through the sufficiency of
the persons [[person]] acting, derive their [[beauty]] not so much from the conclusion,
which with them is quotidian and [[common]] to every [[judge]], as from the
dispute and heat of divers and contrary arguments that the matter of law
and equity will permit and the largest field for reprehension that
some [[philosophers]] have against others is drawn from the diversities and
contradictions wherein every one of them finds himself perplexed, either
on [[purpose]] to show the vacillation of the [[human]] [[mind]] concerning every
thing, or ignorantly compelled by the volubility and incomprehensibility
of all matter; which is the meaning of the maxim--“in a slippery and
sliding place let us suspend our [[belief]];” for, as euripides says,--


   “god’s various works [[work]] perplex the thoughts [[thought]] of [[men]].”


like that which empedocles, as if transported with a [[divine]] fury, and
compelled by [[truth]], often strewed here and there in his writings: “no,
no, we [[feel]] nothing, we see nothing; all things are concealed from
us; there is not one thing of which we can positively say what it is;”
 according to the [[divine]] saying: _cogitationes mortalium timidæ, et
incertæ adinventiones nostro et providentice._ “for the thoughts [[thought]] of
mortal [[men]] are doubtful; and our devices are but uncertain.” it is not
to be [[thought]] [[strange]] if [[men]], despairing to overtake what they hunt
after, have not however lost the [[pleasure]] of the chase; study being
of itself so pleasant an employment; and so pleasant that amongst the
pleasures, the stoics forbid that also which proceeds from the exercise
of the [[mind]], will have it curbed, and find a [[kind]] of intemperance in too
much [[knowledge]].

democritus having eaten figs at his table that tasted of honey, fell
presently to considering with himself whence they should derive this
unusual sweetness; and to be satisfied in it, was about to rise from the
table to see the place whence the figs had been gathered; which his maid
observing, and having understood the cause, smilingly told him that “he
need not trouble himself about that, for she had put them into a vessel
in which there had been honey.” he was vexed at this discovery, and that
she had deprived him of the [[occasion]] of this inquiry, and robbed his
curiosity of matter to [[work]] upon: “go thy way,” said he, “thou hast done
me an injury; but, for all that, i will seek out the cause as if it
were [[natural]];” and would willingly have found out some true [[reason]] for a
false and imaginary effect. this story of a famous and [[great]] philosopher
very clearly represents to us that studious passion that puts us upon
the pursuit of things, of the acquisition of which we despair. plutarch
gives a like [[example]] of some one who would not be satisfied in that
whereof he was in [[doubt]], that he might not lose the [[pleasure]] of
inquiring into it; like the other who would not that his physician
should allay the thirst of his fever, that he might not lose the
pleasure of quenching it by drinking. _satius est supervacua discere,
quam nihil._ “‘tis [[better]] to learn more than necessary than nothing at
all.” as in all sorts of feeding, the [[pleasure]] of eating is very often
single and alone, and that what we take, which is acceptable to the
palate, is not always nourishing or wholesome; so that which our minds
extract from [[science]] does not cease to be pleasant, though there
be nothing in it either nutritive or healthful. thus they say: “the
consideration of [[nature]] is a diet proper for our minds [[mind]], it raises and
elevates us, makes us disdain low and terrestrial things, by comparing
them with those that are celestial and high. the mere inquisition into
great and occult things is very pleasant, even to those who acquire no
other benefit than the reverence and [[fear]] of judging it.” this is
what they profess. the [[vain]] image of this sickly curiosity is yet more
manifest in this other [[example]] which they so often urge. “eudoxus wished
and begged of the gods that he might once see the sun near at hand, to
comprehend the form, greatness, and [[beauty]] of it; even though he should
thereby be immediately burned.” he would at the price of his life
purchase a [[knowledge]], of which the use and possession should at the same
time be taken from him; and for this sudden and vanishing knowledge
lose all the other [[knowledge]] he had in [[present]], or might afterwards have
acquired.

i cannot easily persuade myself that epicurus, [[plato]], and pytagoras,
have given us their atom, [[idea]] and numbers, for current [[pay]]. they were
too [[wise]] to establish their articles of [[faith]] upon things so disputable
and uncertain. but in that obscurity and ignorance in which the world
then was, every one of these [[great]] [[men]] endeavoured to [[present]] some kind
of image or reflection of [[light]], and worked their brains for inventions
that might have a pleasant and subtle appearance; provided that, though
false, they might make [[good]] their ground against those that would oppose
them. _unicuique ista pro ingenio finguntur, non ex scientiæ vi._ “these
things every one fancies according to his wit, and not by any [[power]] of
knowledge.”

one of the ancients, who was reproached, “that he professed [[philosophy]],
of which he nevertheless in his own [[judgment]] made no [[great]] account,”
 made [[answer]], “that this was truly to philosophize.”

they wished to consider all, to balance every thing, and found that an
employment well suited to our [[natural]] curiosity. some things they wrote
for the benefit of [[public]] [[society]], as their religions [[religion]]; and for that
consideration it was but reasonable that they should not examine public
opinions to the quick, that they might not disturb the [[common]] obedience
to the laws [[law]] and customs of their [[country]].

plato treats of this mystery with a raillery manifest enough; for where
he writes according to his own method he gives no [[certain]] [[rule]]. when he
plays the legislator he borrows a magisterial and positive style, and
boldly there foists in his most fantastic inventions, as fit to persuade
the vulgar, as impossible to be believed by himself; knowing very well
how fit we are to receive all sorts of impressions, especially the most
immoderate and preposterous; and yet, in his _laws_, he takes singular
care that nothing be sung in [[public]] but poetry, of which the fiction and
fabulous relations tend to some advantageous end; it being so easy to
imprint all sorts of phantasms in [[human]] minds [[mind]], that it were injustice
not to feed them rather with profitable untruths than with untruths that
are unprofitable and hurtful. he says very roundly, in his _republic,_
“that it is often necessary, for the benefit of [[men]], to [[deceive]] them.”
 it is very easy to distinguish that some of the sects have more followed
truth, and the others utility, by which the [[last]] have gained their
reputation. ‘tis the misery of our condition that often that which
presents itself to our [[imagination]] for the truest does not appear the
most useful to [[life]]. the boldest sects, as the epicurean, pyrrhonian,
and the new academic, are yet constrained to submit to the civil [[law]] at
the end of the account.

there are other subjects [[subject]] that they have tumbled and tossed about, some
to the [[right]] and others to the left, every one endeavouring, [[right]] or
wrong, to give them some [[kind]] of colour; for, having found nothing so
abstruse that they would not venture to speak of, they are very
often forced to forge [[weak]] and ridiculous conjectures; not that they
themselves looked upon them as any foundation, or establishing any
certain [[truth]], but merely for exercise. _non tam id sensisse quod
dicerent, quam exercere ingénia materio difficultate videntur voluisse._
“they seem not so much themselves to have believed what they said, as to
have had a [[mind]] to exercise their wits in the difficulty of the
matter.” and if we did not take it thus, how should we palliate so
great inconstancy, variety, and vanity of opinions [[opinion]], as we see have been
produced by those excellent and admirable [[men]]? as, for [[example]], what
can be more [[vain]] than to imagine, to guess at [[god]], by our analogies and
conjectures? to direct and govern him and the [[world]] by our capacities
and our laws [[law]]? and to serve ourselves, at the expense of the divinity,
with what small portion of capacity he has been pleased to impart to
our [[natural]] condition; and because we cannot extend our sight to his
glorious [[throne]], to have brought him down to our [[corruption]] and our
miseries?

of all [[human]] and ancient opinions [[opinion]] concerning [[religion]], that seems to
me the most likely and most excusable, that acknowledged [[god]] as an
incomprehensible [[power]], the original and preserver of all things, all
goodness, all [[perfection]], receiving and taking in [[good]] part the honour
and reverence that [[man]] paid him, under what method, name, or ceremonies
soever--


      [[jupiter]] omnipotens, rerum, regumque, deûmque,
   progenitor, genitrixque.

      “jove, the almighty, author of all things,
   the [[father]], [[mother]], of both gods and kings [[king]].”


this zeal has universally been looked upon from [[heaven]] with a gracious
eye. all governments [[government]] have reaped fruit from their devotion; impious
men and actions have everywhere had suitable events. pagan histories
acknowledge [[dignity]], order, [[justice]], prodigies, and oracles, employed
for their [[profit]] and instruction in their fabulous religions [[religion]]; [[god]],
through his [[mercy]], vouchsafing, by these temporal benefits, to cherish
the tender principles [[principle]] of a [[kind]] of brutish [[knowledge]] that [[natural]] reason
gave them of him, through the deceiving images of their dreams [[dream]]. not only
deceiving and false, but impious also and injurious, are those that man
has forged from his own invention: and of all the religions [[religion]] that st.
paul found in repute at [[athens]], that which they had dedicated “to the
unknown god” seemed to him the most to be excused.

pythagoras shadowed the [[truth]] a little more closely, judging that
the [[knowledge]] of this first cause and being of beings ought to be
indefinite, without limitation, without declaration; that it was nothing
else than the extreme effort of our [[imagination]] towards [[perfection]],
every one amplifying the [[idea]] according to the talent of his capacity.
but if numa attempted to conform the devotion of his [[people]] to this
project; to attach them to a [[religion]] purely mental, without any
prefixed object and material mixture, he undertook a thing of no use;
the [[human]] [[mind]] could never support itself floating in such an infinity
of inform thoughts [[thought]]; there is required some [[certain]] image to be presented
according to its own model. the [[divine]] majesty has thus, in some sort,
suffered himself to be circumscribed in corporal limits for our
advantage. his supernatural and celestial sacraments have signs of our
earthly condition; his adoration is by sensible offices and words; for
‘tis [[man]] that believes [[belief]] and prays. i shall omit the other arguments upon
this [[subject]]; but a [[man]] would have much ado to make me [[believe]] that the
sight of our crucifixes, that the picture of our saviour’s passion, that
the ornaments and ceremonious motions of our churches [[church]], that the voices
accommodated to the devotion of our thoughts [[thought]], and that emotion of the
senses, do not warm the souls [[soul]] of the [[people]] with a [[religious]] passion of
very advantageous effect.

of those to whom they have given a [[body]], as necessity required in that
universal blindness, i should, i fancy, most incline to those who adored
the sun:--


      la lumière commune,
   l’oil du monde; et si dieu au chef porte des yeux,
   les rayons du soleil sont ses yeulx radieux,
   qui donnent vie à touts, nous maintiennent et gardent,
   et les faictsdes humains en ce monde regardent:
   ce beau, ce grand soleil qui nous faict les saisons,
   selon qu’il entre ou sort de ses douze maisons;
   qui remplit l’univers de ses vertus cognues;
   qui d’un traict de ses yeulx nous dissipe les nues;
   l’esprit, l’ame du monde, ardent et flamboyant,
   en la course d’un jour tout le ciel tournoyant;
   plein d’immense grandeur, rond, vagabond, et ferme;
   lequel tient dessoubs luy tout le monde pour terme:
   en repos, sans repos; oysif, et sans séjour;
   fils aisné de [[nature]], et le père du jour:

      “the [[common]] [[light]] that [[equal]] shines on all,
   diffused around the whole terrestrial ball;
   and, if the almighty ruler of the skies
   has [[eyes]], the sunbeams are his radiant [[eyes]],
   that [[life]] and safety give to [[young]] and old,
   and all [[men’s]] actions upon [[earth]] behold.
   this [[great]], this beautiful, the glorious sun,
   who makes their course the varied seasons run;
   that with his virtues [[virtue]] fills the [[universe]],
   and with one glance can sullen clouds disperse;
   earth’s [[life]] and [[soul]], that, flaming in his sphere,
   surrounds the heavens [[heaven]] in one day’s [[career]];
   immensely [[great]], moving yet firm and round,
   who the whole [[world]] below has made his bound;
   at rest, without rest, idle without stay,
   nature’s first [[son]], and [[father]] of the day:”


forasmuch as, beside this grandeur and [[beauty]] of his, ‘tis the only
piece of this machine that we discover at the remotest distance from us;
and by that means so little known that they were pardonable for entering
into so [[great]] admiration and reverence of it.

thales, who first inquired into this sort of matter, believed [[god]] to be
a spirit that made all things of water; anaximander, that the gods
were always dying and entering into [[life]] again; and that there were an
infinite number of worlds [[world]]; anaximines, that the air was [[god]], that he
was procreate and immense, always moving. anaxagoras the first, was of
opinion that the description and manner of all things were conducted by
the [[power]] and [[reason]] of an infinite spirit. alcmæon gave divinity to
the sun, moon, and stars, and to the [[soul]]. pythagoras made [[god]] a spirit,
spread over the [[nature]] of all things, whence our souls [[soul]] are extracted;
parmenides, a circle surrounding the [[heaven]], and supporting the [[world]] by
the ardour of [[light]]. empedocles pronounced the four elements, of which
all things are composed, to be gods; protagoras had nothing to say,
whether they were or were not, or what they were; democritus was one
while of [[opinion]] that the images and their circuitions were gods;
another while, the [[nature]] that darts out those images; and then,
our [[science]] and [[intelligence]]. [[plato]] divides his [[belief]] into several
opinions; he says, in his _timæus_, that the [[father]] of the [[world]] cannot
be named; in his laws [[law]], that [[men]] are not to inquire into his being; and
elsewhere, in the very same books [[book]], he makes the [[world]], the heavens [[heaven]], the
stars, the [[earth]], and our souls [[soul]], gods; admitting, moreover, those which
have been received by ancient institution in every [[republic]].

xenophon reports a like perplexity in socrates’s doctrine; one while
that [[men]] are not to inquire into the form of [[god]], and presently makes
him maintain that the sun is [[god]], and the [[soul]] [[god]]; that there is but
one [[god]], and then that there are many. speusippus, the nephew of [[plato]],
makes [[god]] a [[certain]] [[power]] governing all things, and that he has a [[soul]].
aristotle one while says it is the spirit, and another the [[world]]; one
while he gives the [[world]] another master, and another while makes [[god]] the
heat of [[heaven]]. zenocrates makes eight, five named amongst the planets;
the sixth composed of all the fixed stars, as of so many members; the
seventh and eighth, the sun and moon. heraclides ponticus does nothing
but float in his [[opinion]], and finally deprives [[god]] of sense, and makes
him shift from one form to another, and at [[last]] says that it is heaven
and [[earth]]. theophrastus wanders in the same irresolution amongst his
fancies, attributing the superintendency of the [[world]] one while to the
understanding, another while to [[heaven]], and then to the stars. strato
says that ‘tis [[nature]], she having the [[power]] of [[generation]], augmentation,
and diminution, without form and sentiment zeno says ‘tis the [[law]] of
nature, commanding [[good]] and prohibiting [[evil]]; which [[law]] is an animal;
and takes away the accustomed gods, [[jupiter]], juno, and vesta. diogenes
apolloniates, that ‘tis air. zenophanes makes [[god]] round, seeing and
hearing, not breathing, and having nothing in [[common]] with [[human]] [[nature]].
aristo thinks [[think]] the form of [[god]] to be incomprehensible, deprives him
of sense, and knows [[know]] not whether he be an animal or something else;
cleanthes, one while supposes it to be [[reason]], another while the [[world]],
another the [[soul]] of [[nature]], and then the supreme heat rolling about, and
environing all. perseus, zeno’s disciple, was of [[opinion]] that [[men]] have
given the title of gods to such as have been useful, and have added
any notable advantage to [[human]] [[life]], and even to profitable things
themselves. chrysippus made a confused heap of all the preceding
theories, and reckons, amongst a thousand forms of gods that he makes,
the [[men]] also that have been deified. diagoras and theodoras flatly
denied that there were any gods at all. epicurus makes the gods shining,
transparent, and perflable, lodged as betwixt two forts, betwixt two
worlds, secure from blows, clothed in a [[human]] figure, and with such
members as we have; which members are to them of no use:--


      ego deum genus esse semper duxi, et dicam colitum;
   sed eos non curare opinor quid agat humanum genus.

      “i ever [[thought]] that gods above there were,
   but do not [[think]] they [[care]] what [[men]] do here.”


trust to your [[philosophy]], my masters; and brag that you have found
the bean in the cake when you see what a rattle is here with so many
philosophical heads! the perplexity of so many worldly forms has gained
this over me, that manners and opinions [[opinion]] contrary to mine do not so much
displease as instruct me; nor so much make me proud as they humble me,
in comparing them. and all other [[choice]] than what comes from the express
and immediate hand of [[god]] seems to me a [[choice]] of very little [[privilege]].
the policies of the [[world]] are no less opposite upon this [[subject]] than
the schools, by which we may [[understand]] that [[fortune]] itself is not more
variable and inconstant, nor more blind and inconsiderate, than our
reason. the things that are most unknown are most proper to be deified;
wherefore to make gods of ourselves, as the ancients did, exceeds the
extremest weakness of understanding. i would much rather have gone along
with those who adored the serpent, the dog, or the ox; forasmuch as
their [[nature]] and being is less known to us, and that we have more room
to imagine what we please of those beasts, and to attribute to them
extraordinary faculties. but to have made gods of our own condition, of
whom we ought to [[know]] the imperfections; and to have attributed to
them [[desire]], anger, [[revenge]], marriages [[marriage]], [[generation]], alliances, [[love]],
jealousy, our members and bones, our fevers and pleasures [[pleasure]], our [[death]] and
obsequies; this must needs have proceeded from a marvellous inebriety of
the [[human]] understanding;


      quæ procul usque adeo divino ab numine distant,
   inque deûm numéro quæ sint indigna videri;

      “from [[divine]] natures [[nature]] these so distant are,
   they are unworthy of that [[character]].”


_formo, otates, vestitus, omatus noti sunt; genera, conjugia,
cognationes, omniaque traducta ad similitudinem imbellitar tis
humano: nam et perturbatis animis inducuntur; accipimus enim deorurn
cupiditates, cegritudines, iracundias_; “their forms, ages [[age]], clothes,
and ornaments are known: their descents, marriages [[marriage]], and kindred, and all
adapted to the similitude of [[human]] weakness; for they are represented to
us with anxious minds [[mind]], and we [[read]] of the lusts, sickness, and anger
of the gods;” as having attributed divinity not only to [[faith]],
virtue, [[honour]], concord, [[liberty]], [[victory]], and piety; but also to
voluptuousness, fraud, [[death]], envy, old [[age]], misery; to [[fear]], fever, ill
fortune, and other injuries of our frail and transitory [[life]]:--


      quid juvat hoc, templis nostros inducere mores?
   o curvæ in terris animæ et colestium inanes!

      “o earth-born souls! by earth-born [[passions]] [[led]],
   to every spark of heav’nly influence dead!
   [[think]] ye that what [[man]] values will inspire
   in minds [[mind]] celestial the same base [[desire]]?”


the [[egyptians]], with an impudent prudence, interdicted, upon [[pain]] of
hanging, that any one should say that their gods, serapis and isis, had
formerly been [[men]]; and yet no one was ignorant that they had been
such; and their effigies, represented with the finger upon the mouth,
signified, says varro, that mysterious decree to their priests [[priest]], to
conceal their mortal original, as it must by necessary consequence
cancel all the veneration paid to them. seeing that [[man]] so much desired
to [[equal]] himself to [[god]], he had done [[better]], says cicero, to have
attracted those [[divine]] conditions to himself, and drawn them down hither
below, than to send his [[corruption]] and misery up on high; but, to take
it [[right]], he has several ways done both the one and the other, with like
vanity of [[opinion]].

when [[philosophers]] search narrowly into the hierarchy of their gods, and
make a [[great]] bustle about distinguishing their alliances, offices, and
power, i cannot [[believe]] they speak as they [[think]]. when [[plato]] describes
pluto’s orchard to us, and the bodily conveniences or pains [[pain]] that attend
us after the ruin and annihilation of our bodies [[body]], and accommodates them
to the feeling we have in this [[life]]:--


      secreti celant calles, et myrtea circum
   sylva tegit; curæ non ipsâ in morte relinquunt;

      “in secret vales and myrtle groves they [[lie]],
   nor do cares [[care]] leave them even when they [[die]].”


when mahomet promises his followers a paradise hung with tapestry,
gilded and enamelled with gold and precious stones, furnished with
wenches of excelling [[beauty]], rare wines, and delicate dishes; it
is easily discerned that these are deceivers that accommodate their
promises to our sensuality, to attract and allure us by hopes [[hope]] and
opinions suitable to our mortal appetites. and yet some amongst us
are fallen into the like error, promising to themselves after the
resurrection a terrestrial and temporal [[life]], accompanied with all sorts
of worldly conveniences and pleasures [[pleasure]]. can we [[believe]] that [[plato]], he
who had such heavenly conceptions, and was so well acquainted with the
divinity as thence to derive the name of the [[divine]] [[plato]], ever thought
that the [[poor]] creature, [[man]], had any thing in him applicable to that
incomprehensible [[power]]? and that he believed that the [[weak]] holds we are
able to take were capable, or the [[force]] of our understanding sufficient,
to participate of beatitude or eternal pains [[pain]]? we should then tell him
from [[human]] [[reason]]: “if the pleasures [[pleasure]] thou dost promise us in the other
life are of the same [[kind]] that i have enjoyed here below, this has
nothing in [[common]] with infinity; though all my five [[natural]] senses
should be even loaded with [[pleasure]], and my [[soul]] full of all the
contentment it could [[hope]] or [[desire]], we [[know]] what all this amounts to,
all this would be nothing; if there be any thing of mine there, there is
nothing [[divine]]; if this be no more than what may belong to our present
condition, it cannot be of any value. all contentment of mortals is
mortal. even the [[knowledge]] of our parents, [[children]], and [[friends]],
if that can affect and delight us in the other [[world]], if that still
continues a satisfaction to us there, we still remain in earthly and
finite conveniences. we cannot as we ought conceive the greatness of
these high and [[divine]] promises, if we could in any sort conceive them;
to have a worthy [[imagination]] of them we must imagine them unimaginable,
inexplicable, and incomprehensible, and absolutely another thing than
those of our miserable [[experience]].” “eye hath not seen,” saith st. paul,
“nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the [[heart]] of [[man]], the things
that [[god]] hath prepared for them that [[love]] him.” and if, to render us
capable, our being were reformed and changed (as thou, [[plato]], sayest, by
thy purifications), it ought to be so extreme and total a [[change]], that
by physical doctrine it be no more us;--


      [[hector]] erat tunc cum bello certabat; at ille
   tractus ab æmonio non erat [[hector]] eqao;

      he [[hector]] was whilst he could [[fight]], but when
   dragg’d by achilles’ steeds, no [[hector]] then;


it must be something else that must receive these recompenses:--


      quod mutatur... dissolvitur; interit ergo;
   trajiciuntur enim partes, atque ordine migrant.

      “things changed dissolved are, and therefore [[die]];
   their parts are mix’d, and from their order fly.”


for in pythagoras’s metempsychosis, and the [[change]] of habitation that
he imagined in souls [[soul]], can we [[believe]] that the lion, in whom the [[soul]] of
cæsar is enclosed, does espouse cæsar’s [[passions]], or that the lion
is he? for if it was still cæsar, they would be in the [[right]] who,
controverting this [[opinion]] with [[plato]], reproach him that the son
might be seen to ride his [[mother]] transformed into a mule, and the like
absurdities. and can we [[believe]] that in the mutations that are made of
the bodies [[body]] of animals into others of the same [[kind]], the new comers are
not other than their predecessors? from the ashes of a phoenix, a worm,
they say, is engendered, and from that another phoenix; who can
imagine that this second phoenix is no other than the first? we see our
silk-worms, as it were, [[die]] and wither; and from this withered [[body]] a
butterfly is produced; and from that another worm; how ridiculous would
it be to imagine that this was still the first! that which once has
ceased to be is no more:--


      nec, si materiam nostram collegerit ætas
   post obitum, rursumque redegerit, ut sita nunc est,
   atque iterum nobis fuerint data lumina vitæ,
   pertineat quidquam tamen ad nos id quoque factum,
   interrupta semel cum sit repetentia nostra.

      “neither tho’ [[time]] should gather and restore
   our matter to the form it was before,
   and give again new [[light]] to see withal,
   would that new figure us concern at all;
   or we again ever the same be seen,
   our being having interrupted been.”


and, [[plato]], when thou sayest in another place that it shall be the
spiritual part of [[man]] that will be concerned in the fruition of the
recompense of another [[life]], thou tellest us a thing wherein there is as
little appearance of [[truth]]:--


      scilicet, avolsis radicibus, ut nequit ullam
   dispicere ipsa oculus rem, seorsum corpore toto;

      “no more than [[eyes]] once from their optics torn,
   can ever after any thing discern;”


for, by this account, it would no more be [[man]], nor consequently us,
who would be concerned in this enjoyment; for we are composed of two
principal essential parts, the separation of which is the [[death]] and ruin
of our being:--


      inter enim jecta est vital pausa, vageque
   deerrarunt passim motus ab sensibus omnes;

      “when once that pause of [[life]] is come between,
   ‘tis just the same as we had never been;”


we cannot say that the [[man]] suffers when the worms feed upon his members,
and that the [[earth]] consumes them:--


      et nihil hoc ad nos, qui coltu conjugioque
   corporis atque animæ consistimus uniter apti.

      “what’s that to us? for we are only we,
   while [[soul]] and [[body]] in one frame agree.”


moreover, upon what foundation of their [[justice]] can the gods take notice
of or [[reward]] [[man]] after his [[death]] and [[virtuous]] actions, since it was
themselves that put them in the way and [[mind]] to do them? and why should
they be offended at or punish him for wicked ones, since themselves have
created in him so frail a condition, and when, with one glance of their
will, they might prevent him from falling? might not epicurus, with
great colour of [[human]] [[reason]], object this to [[plato]], did he not often
save himself with this sentence: “that it is impossible to establish any
thing [[certain]] of the [[immortal]] [[nature]] by the mortal?” she does nothing
but err throughout, but especially when she meddles with [[divine]] things.
who does more evidently perceive this than we? for although we have
given her [[certain]] and infallible principles [[principle]]; and though we have
enlightened her steps with the [[sacred]] lamp of [[truth]] that it has pleased
god to communicate to us; we daily see, nevertheless, that if she swerve
never so little from the ordinary path; and that she stray from, or
wander out of the way set out and beaten by the [[church]], how soon she
loses, confounds and fetters herself, tumbling and floating in this
vast, turbulent, and waving sea of [[human]] opinions [[opinion]], without restraint,
and without any determinate end; so soon as she loses that [[great]] and
common road, she enters into a labyrinth of a thousand several paths.

man cannot be any thing but what he is, nor imagine beyond the reach of
his capacity. “tis a greater presumption,” says plutarch, “in them who
are but [[men]] to attempt to speak and discourse of the gods and demi-gods
than it is in a [[man]] utterly ignorant of [[music]] to give an [[opinion]] of
singing; or in a [[man]] who never saw a camp to dispute about arms and
martial affairs, presuming by some [[light]] conjecture to [[understand]] the
effects of an art [[arts]] he is totally a stranger to.” antiquity, i [[believe]],
thought to put a compliment upon, and to add something to, the divine
grandeur in assimilating it to [[man]], investing it with his faculties,
and adorning it with his ugly humours [[humour]] and most shameful necessities;
offering it our aliments to [[eat]], presenting it with our dances,
mummeries, and farces, to divert it; with our vestments to cover it,
and our houses to inhabit, coaxing it with the odour of incense and the
sounds of [[music]], with festoons and nosegays; and to accommodate it to
our vicious [[passions]], flattering its [[justice]] with inhuman vengeance, and
with the ruin and dissipation of things by it created and preserved as
tiberius sempronius, who burnt the [[rich]] spoils and arms he had gained
from the [[enemy]] in sardinia for a [[sacrifice]] to vulcan; and paulus
æmilius, those of macedonia, to [[mars]] and minerva; and alexander,
arriving at the [[indian]] ocean, threw several [[great]] vessels of gold into
the sea, in [[honour]] of thetes; and moreover loading her altars with
a slaughter not of [[innocent]] beasts only, but of [[men]] also, as several
nations, and ours among the rest, were commonly used to do; and i
believe there is no nation under the sun that has not done the same:--


      sulmone creatos
   quatuor hîc juvenes, totidem quos educat ufens,
   viventes rapit, inferias quos immolet umbris.

      “four sons [[son]] of sulmo, four whom ufens bred,
   he took in flight, and living victims [[led]],
   to please the ghost of pallas, and expire
   in [[sacrifice]] before his fun’ral pyre.”


the getæ hold themselves to be [[immortal]], and that their [[death]] is nothing
but a [[journey]] to their [[god]] zamolxis. every five years they dispatch some
one among them to him, to entreat of him such necessaries as they stand
in need of. this envoy is chosen by lot, and the form of dispatching
him, after he has been instructed by word of mouth what he is to
deliver, is that of the assistants, three hold up as many javelins, upon
which the rest throw his [[body]] with all their [[force]]. if he happen to
be wounded in a mortal part, and that he immediately dies, ‘tis held a
certain argument of [[divine]] favour; but if he escapes, he is looked upon
as a wicked and execrable wretch, and another is dismissed after the
same manner in his stead. amestris, the [[mother]] of xerxes, being grown
old, caused at once fourteen [[young]] [[men]], of the [[best]] families [[family]] of [[persia]],
to be buried alive, according to the [[religion]] of the [[country]], to gratify
some infernal deity. and even to this day the idols of themixtitan
are cemented with the [[blood]] of little [[children]], and they delight in no
sacrifice but of these pure and infantine souls [[soul]]; a [[justice]] thirsty of
innocent [[blood]]:--


   tantum religio potuit suadere maloram.

   “such impious use was of [[religion]] made,
   so many demon acts it could persuade.”


the carthaginians immolated their own [[children]] to saturn; and those who
had none of their own bought of others, the [[father]] and [[mother]] being in
the mean [[time]] obliged to assist at the [[ceremony]] with a [[gay]] and contented
countenance.

it was a [[strange]] fancy to [[think]] to gratify the [[divine]] bounty with our
afflictions; like the lacedemonians, who regaled their diana with the
tormenting of [[young]] boys, whom they caused to be whipped for her sake,
very often to [[death]]. it was a savage [[humour]] to imagine to gratify the
architect by the subversion of his building, and to [[think]] to take away
the [[punishment]] due to the guilty by punishing the [[innocent]]; and that
poor iphigenia, at the port of aulis, should by her [[death]] and immolation
acquit, towards [[god]], the whole [[army]] of the greeks [[greek]] from all the crimes
they had committed;


      et casta inceste, nubendi tempore in ipso,
   hostia concideret mactatu mosta parentis;

      “that the chaste virgin in her nuptial band
   should [[die]] by an unnat’ral father’s hand;”


and that the two [[noble]] and generous souls [[soul]] of the two decii, the father
and the [[son]], to incline the favour of the gods to be propitious to the
affairs of [[rome]], should throw themselves headlong into the thickest of
the [[enemy]]: _quo fuit tanta deorum iniquitas, ut placari populo romano
non possent, nisi tales viri occidissent?_ “how [[great]] an [[injustice]] in
the gods was it that they could not be reconciled to the [[people]] of rome
unless such [[men]] perished!” to which may be added, that it is not for the
criminal to cause himself to be scourged according to his own measure
nor at his own [[time]], but that it purely belongs to the [[judge]], who
considers nothing as chastisements but the penalty that he appoints, and
cannot call that [[punishment]] which proceeds from the [[consent]] of him that
suffers. the [[divine]] vengeance presupposes an absolute dissent in us,
both for its [[justice]] and for our own penalty. and therefore it was a
ridiculous [[humour]] of polycrates, [[tyrant]] of samos, who, to interrupt the
continued course of his [[good]] [[fortune]], and to balance it, went and threw
the dearest and most precious jewel he had into the sea, believing
that by this voluntary and antedated mishap he bribed and satisfied
the [[revolution]] and vicissitude of [[fortune]]; and she, to mock his folly,
ordered it so that the same jewel came again into his hands, found
in the belly of a fish. and then to what end were those tearings and
dismemberments of the corybantes, the menades, and, in our times [[time]], of the
mahometans, who slash their faces, bosoms, and limbs, to gratify their
prophet; seeing that the offence lies [[lie]] in the will, not in the breast,
eyes, genitals, roundness of form, the shoulders, or the throat?
_tantus est perturbâto mentis, et sedibus suis pilso, furor, ut sic dii
placentur, quemadmodum ne homines quidem soviunt._ “so [[great]] is the
fury and madness of troubled minds [[mind]] when once displaced from the seat of
reason, as if the gods should be appeased with what even [[men]] are not so
cruel as to approve.” the use of this [[natural]] contexture has not only
respect to us, but also to the service of [[god]] and other [[men]]; ‘tis as
unjust for us voluntarily to wound or hurt it as to kill ourselves upon
any pretence whatever; it seems to be [[great]] cowardice and [[treason]] to
exercise [[cruelty]] upon, and to [[destroy]], the functions of the [[body]] that
are stupid and servile, to spare the [[soul]] the solicitude of governing
them according to [[reason]]: _ubi iratos deos timent, qui sic propitios
habere merentur? in regiæ libidinis voluptatem castrati sunt quidam;
sed nemo sibi, ne vir esset, jubente domino, mantis intulit._ “where are
they so afraid of the anger of the gods as to [[merit]] their favour at that
rate? some, indeed, have been made eunuchs for the [[lust]] of princes [[prince]]: but
no [[man]] at his master’s command has put his own hand to unman himself.”
 so did they fill their [[religion]] with several ill effects:--


   sæpius olim religio peperit scelerosa atque impia facta.

   “in elder times [[time]] [[religion]] did commit most fearful crimes.”


now nothing of ours can in any sort be compared or likened unto
the [[divine]] [[nature]], which will not blemish and stain it with much
imperfection.

how can that infinite [[beauty]], [[power]], and goodness, admit of any
correspondence or similitude to such abject things as we are, without
extreme [[wrong]] and manifest dishonour to his [[divine]] greatness? _infirmum
dei fortius est hominibs; et stultum dei sapientius est hominibus._ “for
the foolishness of [[god]] is wiser than [[men]], and the weakness of [[god]] is
stronger than [[men]].” stilpo, the philosopher, being [[asked]], “whether
the gods were delighted with our adorations and sacrifices [[sacrifice]]?”--“you are
indiscreet,” answered he; “let us withdraw apart, if you would talk of
such things.” nevertheless, we prescribe him bounds, we keep his power
besieged by our reasons [[reason]] (i call our ravings and dreams [[dream]] [[reason]], with the
dispensation of [[philosophy]], which says, “that the wicked [[man]], and even
the [[fool]], go mad by [[reason]], but a particular form of reason”), we
would [[subject]] him to the [[vain]] and feeble appearances of our
understandings,--him who has made both us and our [[knowledge]]. because
that nothing is made of nothing, [[god]] therefore could not make the world
without matter. what! has [[god]] put into our hands the keys and most
secret springs of his [[power]]? is he obliged not to exceed the limits of
our [[knowledge]]? put the case, o man! that thou hast been able here to
mark some footsteps of his effects; dost thou therefore [[think]] that he
has employed all he can, and has crowded all his forms and ideas [[idea]] in this
work? thou seest nothing but the order and [[revolution]] of this little
cave in which thou art [[arts]] lodged, if, indeed, thou dost see so much;
whereas his divinity has an infinite jurisdiction beyond. this part is
nothing in comparison of the whole:--


      omnia cum colo, terràque, manque,
   nil sunt ad summam summal totius omnem.

      “the [[earth]], the sea, and skies [[sky]], from pole to pole,
   are small, nay, nothing to the mighty whole.”


‘tis a municipal [[law]] that thou allegest, thou knowest not what is
universal tie thyself to that to which thou art [[arts]] [[subject]], but not him; he
is not of thy brotherhood, thy fellow-citizen, or companion. if he has
in some sort communicated himself unto thee, ‘tis not to debase himself
unto thy littleness, nor to make thee comptroller of his [[power]]; the
human [[body]] cannot fly to the clouds; rules [[rule]] are for thee. the sun runs
every day his ordinary course; the bounds of the sea and the earth
cannot be confounded; the water is unstable and without firmness; a
wall, unless it be broken, is impenetrable to a solid [[body]]; a [[man]] cannot
preserve his [[life]] in the flames; he cannot be both in [[heaven]] and upon
earth, and corporally in a thousand places at once. ‘tis for thee that
he has made these rules [[rule]]; ‘tis thee that they concern; he has manifested
to christians [[christian]] that he has enfranchised himself from them all when it
pleased him. and, in [[truth]], why, almighty as he is, should he have
limited his [[power]] within any [[certain]] bounds? in favour of whom should he
have renounced his [[privilege]]? thy [[reason]] has in no other thing more of
likelihood and foundation than in that wherein it persuades thee that
there is a plurality of worlds [[world]]:--


      terramque et solem, lunam, mare, estera quo rant,
   non esse unica, sed numéro magis innumerali.

      “that [[earth]], sun, moon, sea, and the rest that are,
   not [[single]], but innumerable were.”


the most eminent minds [[mind]] of elder times [[time]] believed it; and some of this
age of ours, compelled by the appearances of [[human]] [[reason]], do the same;
forasmuch as in this fabric that we behold there is nothing [[single]] and
one,


      cum in summà res nulla sit una,
   unica quo gignatur, et unica solaque crescat;

      “since nothing’s [[single]] in this mighty place,
   that can alone beget, alone increase;”


and that all the kinds [[kind]] are multiplied in some number; by which it seems
not to be likely that [[god]] should have made this [[work]] only without a
companion; and that the matter of this form should have been totally
drained in this [[individual]].


      quare etiam atque etiam tales fateare necesse est
   esse alios alibi congressus materiali;
   qualis hic est, avido complexu quem tenet æther.

      “wherefore ‘tis necessary to confess
   that there must elsewhere be the like congress
   of the like matter, which the airy space
   holds fast within its infinite embrace.”


especially if it be a living creature, which its motions render so
credible that [[plato]] affirms it, and that many of our [[people]] do either
confirm, or dare not deny it; no more than that ancient [[opinion]] that
the heavens [[heaven]], the stars, and other members of the [[world]], are creatures
composed of [[body]] and [[soul]], mortal in [[respect]] of their composition,
but [[immortal]] by the determination of the creator. now if there be many
worlds, as democritus, epicurus, and almost all [[philosophy]] has believed,
what do we [[know]] that the principles [[principle]] and rules [[rule]] of this of ours in like
manner concern the rest? they may peradventure have another form and
another polity. epicurus supposes them either like or unlike. we see
in this [[world]] an infinite difference and variety, only by distance of
places; neither com, wine, nor any of our animals are to be seen in that
new comer of the [[world]] discovered by our fathers [[father]]; ‘tis all there another
thing; and in times [[time]] [[past]], do but consider in how many parts of the world
they had no [[knowledge]] either of bacchus or ceres. if pliny and herodotus
are to be believed, there are in [[certain]] places kinds [[kind]] of [[men]] very little
resembling us, mongrel and ambiguous forms, betwixt the [[human]] and brutal
natures; there are countries [[country]] where [[men]] are bom without heads, having
their mouth and [[eyes]] in their breast; where they are all hermaphrodites;
where they go on all four; where they have but one eye in the forehead,
and a head more like a dog than like ours; where they are half fish the
lower part, and [[live]] in the water; where the [[women]] bear at five years
old, and [[live]] but eight; where the head and the skin of the forehead is
so hard that a [[sword]] will not touch it, but rebounds again; where men
have no beards; nations that [[know]] not the use of [[fire]]; others that eject
seed of a black colour. what shall we say of those that naturally change
themselves into wolves, colts, and then into [[men]] again? and if it be
true, as plutarch says, that in some place of the indies there are men
without mouths, who nourish themselves with the smell of [[certain]] odours,
how many of our descriptions are false? he is no longer risible, nor,
perhaps, capable of [[reason]] and [[society]]. the disposition and cause of our
internal composition would then for the most part be to no [[purpose]], and
of no use.

moreover, how many things are there in our own [[knowledge]] that oppose
those fine rules [[rule]] we have cut out for and prescribe to [[nature]]? and yet we
must undertake to circumscribe thereto [[god]] himself! how many things do
we call miraculous, and contrary to [[nature]]? this is done by every nation
and by every [[man]], according to the proportion of his ignorance. how many
occult properties [[property]] and quintessences do we daily discover? for, for us
to go “according to [[nature]],” is no more but to go “according to our
understanding,” as far as that is able to [[follow]], and as far as we
are able to see into it; all beyond that is, forsooth, monstrous and
irregular. now, by this account, all things shall be monstrous to the
wisest and most understanding [[men]]; for [[human]] [[reason]] has persuaded them
that there was no manner of ground nor foundation, not so much as to be
assured that snow is [[white]], and anaxagoras affirmed it to be black; if
there be any thing, or if there be nothing; if there be knowledge
or ignorance, which metrodorus of chios denied that [[man]] was able to
determine; or whether we [[live]], as euripides doubts [[doubt]] whether the [[life]] we
live is [[life]], or whether that we call [[death]] be not [[life]], [--greek--]
and not without some appearance. for why do we derive the title of being
from this instant, which is but a flash in the infinite course of an
eternal night, and so short an interruption of our perpetual and natural
condition, [[death]] possessing all the before and after this moment, and
also a [[good]] part of the moment itself. others swear there is no motion
at all, as followers of melissus, and that nothing stirs. for if there
be but one, neither can that spherical motion be of any use to him,
nor motion from one place to another, as [[plato]] proves: “that there is
neither [[generation]] nor [[corruption]] in [[nature]].” protagoras says that there
is nothing in [[nature]] but [[doubt]]; that a [[man]] may equally dispute of all
things; and even of this, whether a [[man]] can equally dispute of all
things; nausiphanes, that of things which seem to be, nothing is
more than it is not; that there is nothing [[certain]] but uncertainty;
parmenides, that of that which seems, there is no one thing in general;
that there is but one thing; zeno, that one same is not, and that there
is nothing; if there were one thing, it would either be in another or in
itself; if it be in another, they are two; if it be in itself, they are
yet two; the comprehending, and the comprehended. according to these
doctrines the [[nature]] of things is no other than a shadow, either false
or [[vain]].

this way of speaking in a [[christian]] [[man]] has ever seemed to me very
indiscreet and irreverent. “god cannot [[die]]; [[god]] cannot contradict
himself; [[god]] cannot do this or that.” i do not like to have the divine
power so limited by the laws [[law]] of [[men’s]] mouths; and the [[idea]] which
presents itself to us in those propositions ought to be more religiously
and reverently expressed.

our speaking has its failings and defects, as well as all the rest. most
of the occasions [[occasion]] of disturbance in the [[world]] are grammatical ones; our
suits only spring from disputes as to the interpretation of laws [[law]]; and
most wars [[war]] proceed from the inability of ministers clearly to express the
conventions and treaties of amity of princes [[prince]]. how many quarrels, and
of how [[great]] importance, has the [[doubt]] of the meaning of this syllable,
_hoc_,* created in the [[world]]? let us take the clearest conclusion that
logic itself


   * montaigne here refers to the controversies between
     the catholics and protestants about transubstantiation.


presents us withal; if you say, “it is fine weather,” and that you
say true, it is then fine weather. is not this a very [[certain]] form of
speaking? and yet it will [[deceive]] us; that it will do so, let us follow
the [[example]]: if you say, “i [[lie]],” if you say true, you do [[lie]]. the art [[arts]],
the [[reason]], and [[force]] of the conclusion of this, are the same with the
other, and yet we are gravelled. the pyrrhonian [[philosophers]], i see,
cannot express their general conception in any [[kind]] of speaking; for
they would require a new [[language]] on [[purpose]]; ours is all formed of
affirmative propositions, which are totally antarctic to them; insomuch
that when they say “i [[doubt]],” they are presently taken by the throat, to
make them confess that at least they [[know]] and are assured that they do
doubt. by which means they have been compelled to shelter themselves
under this medical comparison, without which their [[humour]] would be
inexplicable: when they pronounce, “i [[know]] not,” or, “i [[doubt]],” they say
that this proposition carries off itself with the rest, no more nor less
than rhubarb, that drives out the ill humours [[humour]], and carries itself
off with them. this fancy will be more certainly understood by
interrogation: “what do i [[know]]?” as i bear it with the emblem of a
balance.

see what use they make of this irreverent way of speaking; in the
present disputes about our [[religion]], if you press its adversaries too
hard, they will roundly tell you, “that it is not in the [[power]] of [[god]] to
make it so, that his [[body]] should be in paradise and upon [[earth]], and in
several places at once.” and see, too, what advantage the old scoffer
made of this. “at least,” says he, “it is no little consolation to man
to see that [[god]] cannot do all things; for he cannot kill himself, though
he would; which is the [[greatest]] [[privilege]] we have in our condition; he
cannot make mortal [[immortal]], nor revive the [[dead]]; nor make it so, that
he who has lived has not; nor that he who has had honours [[honour]] has not had
them; having no other [[right]] to the [[past]] than that of oblivion.” and that
the comparison of [[man]] to [[god]] may yet be made out by jocose examples [[example]]: “he
cannot order it so,” says he, “that twice ten shall not be twenty.”
 this is what he says, and what a [[christian]] ought to take heed shall not
escape his lips. whereas, on the contrary, it seems as if [[men]] studied
this foolish daring of [[language]], to reduce [[god]] to their own measure:--


      cras vel atrâ nube polum, pater, occupato,
   vel sole puro; non tamen irritum
   quodcumque retro est efficiet, neque
   diffinget infectumque reddet
   quod fugiens semel hora vexit.

      “to-morrow, let it shine or rain,
   yet cannot this the [[past]] make [[vain]]:
   nor uncreate and render void
   that which was yesterday enjoyed.”


when we say that the infinity of ages [[age]], as well [[past]] as to come, are but
one instant with [[god]]; that his goodness, [[wisdom]], and [[power]] are the same
with his essence; our mouths speak it, but our understandings apprehend
it not; and yet, such is our [[vain]] [[opinion]] of ourselves, that we must
make the divinity to pass through our sieve; and thence proceed all the
dreams and errors with which the [[world]] abounds, whilst we reduce and
weigh in our balance a thing so far above our poise. _mirum quo procédat
improbitas cordis humani, parvulo aliquo intritata successu._ “‘tis
wonderful to what the wickedness of man’s [[heart]] will proceed, if
elevated with the least [[success]].” how magisterially and insolently does
epicurus reprove the stoics, for maintaining that the truly [[good]] and
happy being appertained only to [[god]], and that the [[wise]] [[man]] had nothing
but a shadow and resemblance of it! how temerariously have they bound
god to [[destiny]] (a thing which, by my [[consent]], none that bears the name
of a [[christian]] shall ever do again)! and thales, [[plato]], and pythagoras
have enslaved him to necessity. this arrogance of attempting to discover
god with our [[eyes]] has been the cause that an eminent [[person]] among us has
attributed to the divinity a corporal form; and is the [[reason]] of what
happens to us every day, of attributing to [[god]] important events, by a
particular assignment. because they weigh with us, they conclude that
they also weigh with him, and that he has a more intent and vigilant
regard to them than to others of less moment to us or of ordinary
course: _magna dii curant, parva negligunt:_ “the gods are concerned at
great matters, but slight the small.” listen to him; he will clear this
to you by his [[reason]]: _nec in regnis quidem reges omnia minima curant:_
“neither indeed do kings [[king]] in their administration take notice of all the
least concerns.” as if to that [[king]] of kings [[king]] it were more or less
to subvert a [[kingdom]], or to move the leaf of a tree; or as if his
providence acted after another manner in inclining the event of a battle
than in the leap of a flea. the hand of his [[government]] is laid upon
every thing after the same manner, with the same [[power]] and order; our
interest does nothing towards it; our inclinations and measures sway
nothing with him. _deus ita artifex magnus in magnis, ut minor non sit
in parvis:_ “god is so [[great]] an artificer in [[great]] things, that he is no
less in the least” our arrogancy sets this blasphemous comparison
ever before us. because our employments are a burden to us, strato has
courteously been pleased to exempt the gods from all offices, as their
priests are; he makes [[nature]] [[produce]] and support all things; and
with her weights and motions make up the several parts of the [[world]],
discharging [[human]] [[nature]] from the awe of [[divine]] judgments [[judgment]]: _quod beatum
æterumque sit, id nec habere negotii quicquam, nec exhibere alteri:_
“what is blessed and eternal has neither any [[business]] itself nor gives
any to another.” [[nature]] will that in like things there should be a like
relation. the infinite number of mortals, therefore, concludes a
like number of immortals [[immortal]]; the infinite things that kill and destroy
presupposes as many that preserve and [[profit]]. as the souls [[soul]] of the
gods, without tongue, eye, or ear, do every one of them [[feel]] amongst
themselves what the other feels [[feel]], and [[judge]] our thoughts [[thought]]; so the souls [[soul]] of
men, when at [[liberty]] and loosed from the [[body]], either by sleep or some
ecstacy, [[divine]], foretell, and see things, which, whilst joined to the
body, they could not see. “men,” says st. paul, “professing themselves
to be [[wise]], they become fools [[fool]]; and [[change]] the [[glory]] of the uncorruptible
god into an image made like corruptible [[man]].” do but take notice of the
juggling in the ancient deifications. after the [[great]] and stately pomp
of the [[funeral]], so soon as the [[fire]] began to mount to the top of the
pyramid, and to catch hold of the couch where the [[body]] lay, they at the
same [[time]] turned out an eagle, which flying upward, signified that the
soul went into paradise. we have a thousand medals, and particularly
of the worthy faustina, where this eagle is represented carrying these
deified souls [[soul]] to [[heaven]] with their heels upwards. ‘tis [[pity]] that we
should [[fool]] ourselves with our own fopperies and inventions,


   quod finxere, timent,

   “they [[fear]] their own inventions,”


like [[children]] who are frighted with the same face of their playfellow,
that they themselves have smeared and smutted. _quasi quicquam
infelicius sit homine, cui sua figmenta dominantur:_

“as if any thing could be more unhappy than [[man]], who is insulted over by
his own [[imagination]].” ‘tis far from honouring him who made us, to honour
him that we have made. augustus had more temples than [[jupiter]], served
with as much [[religion]] and [[belief]] of [[miracles]]. the thracians, in return
of the benefits they had received from agesilaus, came to bring him word
that they had canonized him: “has your nation,” said he to them, “the
power to make gods of whom they please? [[pray]] first deify some one
amongst yourselves, and when i shall see what advantage he has by it,
i will thank you for your offer.” [[man]] is certainly stark mad; he cannot
make a worm, and yet he will be making gods by dozens. hear trismegistus
in [[praise]] of our sufficiency: “of all the wonderful things, it surmounts
all wonder that [[man]] could find out the [[divine]] [[nature]] and make it.” and
take here the arguments of the school of [[philosophy]] itself:--


      nosse cui divos et coli munina soli,
   aut soli nescire, datum.

      “to whom to [[know]] the deities of [[heaven]],
   or [[know]] he knows [[know]] them not, alone ‘tis given.”


“if there is a [[god]], he is a living creature; if he be a living creature,
he has sense; and if he has sense, he is [[subject]] to [[corruption]]. if he
be without a [[body]] he is without a [[soul]], and consequently without action;
and if he has a [[body]], it is perishable.” is not here a triumph? we
are incapable of having made the [[world]]; there must then be some more
excellent [[nature]] that has put a hand to the [[work]]. it were a foolish and
ridiculous arrogance to esteem ourselves the most [[perfect]] thing of the
universe. there must then be something that is [[better]], and that must be
god. when you see a stately and stupendous edifice, though you do not
know who is the owner of it, you would yet conclude it was not built for
rats. and this [[divine]] structure, that we behold of the celestial
palace, have we not [[reason]] to [[believe]] that it is the residence of some
possessor, who is much greater than we? is not the most supreme always
the most worthy? but we are in the lowest form. nothing without a soul
and without [[reason]] can [[produce]] a living creature capable of [[reason]]. the
world produces [[produce]] us, the [[world]] then has [[soul]] and [[reason]]. every part of us
is less than we. we are part of the [[world]], the [[world]] therefore is endued
with [[wisdom]] and [[reason]], and that more abundantly than we. ‘tis a fine
thing to have a [[great]] [[government]]; the [[government]] of the [[world]] then
appertains to some [[happy]] [[nature]]. the stars do us no harm; they are then
full of goodness. we have need of nourishment; then so have the gods
also, and feed upon the vapours of the [[earth]]. worldly goods [[good]] are not
goods to [[god]]; therefore they are not goods [[good]] to us; offending and being
offended are equally testimonies of imbecility; ‘tis therefore folly to
fear [[god]]. [[god]] is [[good]] by his [[nature]]; [[man]] by his industry, which is more.
the [[divine]] and [[human]] [[wisdom]] have no other distinction, but that the
first is eternal; but duration is no accession to [[wisdom]], therefore we
are companions. we have [[life]], [[reason]], and [[liberty]]; we esteem goodness,
charity, and [[justice]]; these qualities are then in him. in conclusion,
building and destroying, the conditions of the divinity, are forged by
man, according as they relate to himself. what a pattern, and what a
model! let us stretch, let us raise and swell [[human]] qualities as much as
we please; puff up thyself, [[poor]] [[man]], yet more and more, and more:--


   non, si tu ruperis, inquit.

   “not if thou burst,” said he.


_profecto non deum, quern cogitare non possunt, sed semetip pro illo
cogitantes, non ilium, sed seipsos, non illi, sed sibi comparant?_
“certainly they do not imagine [[god]], whom they cannot imagine; but
they imagine themselves in his stead; they do not compare him, but
themselves, not to him, but to themselves.” in [[natural]] things the
effects do but half relate to their causes. what’s this to the [[purpose]]?
his condition is above the order of [[nature]], too elevated, too remote,
and too mighty, to permit itself to be bound and fettered by our
conclusions. ‘tis not through ourselves that we arrive at that place;
our ways [[lie]] too low. we are no nearer [[heaven]] on the top of mount cenis
than at the bottom of the sea; take the distance with your astrolabe.
they debase [[god]] even to the carnal [[knowledge]] of [[women]], to so many times [[time]],
and so many generations [[generation]]. paulina, the [[wife]] of satuminus, a matron of
great [[reputation]] at [[rome]], thinking she lay with the [[god]] serapis, found
herself in the arms of an amoroso of hers, through the panderism of the
priests of his temple. varro, the most subtle and most learned of all
the latin authors, in his [[book]] of theology, writes, that the sexton of
hercules’s temple, throwing dice with one hand for himself, and with the
other for hercules, played after that manner with him for a supper and
a wench; if he won, at the expense of the offerings; if he lost, at his
own. the sexton lost, and paid the supper and the wench. her name was
laurentina, who saw by night this [[god]] in her arms, who moreover told
her, that the first she met the next day, should give her a heavenly
reward; which proved to be taruncius, a [[rich]] [[young]] [[man]], who took her
home to his house, and in [[time]] left her his inheritrix. she, in her
turn, thinking to do a thing that would be pleasing to the [[god]], left the
people of [[rome]] heirs to her; and therefore had [[divine]] honours [[honour]] attributed
to her. as if it had not been sufficient that [[plato]] was originally
descended from the gods by a double line, and that he had [[neptune]] for
the [[common]] [[father]] of his [[race]], it was certainly believed at [[athens]], that
aristo, having a [[mind]] to enjoy the [[fair]] perictione, could not, and
was warned by the [[god]] [[apollo]], in a [[dream]], to leave her unpolluted and
untouched, till she should first be brought to bed. these were the
father and [[mother]] of [[plato]]. how many ridiculous stories are there of
like cuckoldings, committed by the gods against [[poor]] mortal men! and how
many husbands injuriously scandaled in favour of the children! in the
mahometan [[religion]] there are merlins enough found by the [[belief]] of the
people; that is to say, [[children]] without fathers [[father]], [[spiritual]], divinely
conceived in the wombs of virgins, and carry names that signify so much
in their [[language]].

we are to observe that to every thing nothing is more dear and estimable
than its being (the lion, the eagle the dolphin, prize nothing above
their own kind); and that every thing assimilates the qualities of all
other things to its own proper qualities, which we may indeed extend
or contract, but that’s all; for beyond that relation and [[principle]] our
imagination cannot go, can guess at nothing else, nor possibly go out
thence, nor stretch beyond it; whence spring these ancient conclusions:
of all forms the most beautiful is that of [[man]]; therefore [[god]] must be
of that form. no one can be [[happy]] without [[virtue]], nor [[virtue]] be without
reason, and [[reason]] cannot inhabit anywhere but in a [[human]] shape; [[god]] is
therefore clothed in a [[human]] figure. _ita est informatum et anticipatum
mentibus nostris, ut homini, quum de deo cogitet, forma occurrat
hu-mana._ “it is so imprinted in our minds [[mind]], and the fancy is so
prepossessed with it, that when a [[man]] thinks [[think]] of [[god]], a [[human]] figure ever
presents itself to the [[imagination]].” therefore it was that xenophanes
pleasantly said, “that if beasts frame any gods to themselves, as ‘tis
likely they do, they make them certainly such as themselves are, and
glorify themselves in it, as we do. for why may not a goose say thus;
“all the parts of the [[universe]] i have an interest in; the [[earth]] serves
me to walk upon; the sun to [[light]] me; the stars have their influence
upon me; i have such an advantage by the winds and such by the waters;
there is nothing that yon heavenly roof looks upon so favourably as me;
i am the darling of nature! is it not [[man]] that keeps, lodges, and serves
me? ‘tis for me that he both sows and grinds; if he eats me he does the
same by his fellow-men, and so do i the worms that kill and devour him.”
 as much might be said by a crane, and with greater confidence, upon the
account of the [[liberty]] of his flight, and the possession of that high
and beautiful region. _tam blanda conciliatrix, et tam sui est lena ipsa
natura._ “so flattering and wheedling a bawd is [[nature]] to herself.”

now by the same consequence, the destinies are then for us; for us the
world; it shines it thunders for us; creator and creatures, all are for
us; ‘tis the mark and point to which the universality of things aims.
look into the records that [[philosophy]] has kept for two thousand years
and more, of the affairs of [[heaven]]; the gods all that while have
neither acted nor spoken but for [[man]]. she does not allow them any other
consultation or occupation. see them here against us in [[war]]:--


      domitosque herculeâ manu
   telluris juvenes, unde periculum
   fulgens contre mu it domus
   saturai veteris.

      “the brawny sons [[son]] of [[earth]], subdu’d by hand
   of hercules on the phlegræan strand,
   where the rude shock did such an uproar make,
   as made old saturn’s sparkling palace shake.”


and here you shall see them participate of our troubles, to make a
return for our having so often shared in theirs:--


      neptunus muros, magnoque emota tridenti
   fundamenta quatit, totamque à sedibus urbem
   emit: hie juno scæas sævissima portas prima tenet.

      “amidst that smother [[neptune]] holds his place,
   below the walls’ foundation drives his mace,
   and heaves the [[city]] from its solid base.
   see where in arms the cruel juno stands,
   full in the scæan gate.”


the caunians, [[jealous]] of the [[authority]] of their own proper gods, armed
themselves on the days of their devotion, and through the whole of their
precincts ran cutting and slashing the air with their swords [[sword]], by that
means to drive away and banish all [[foreign]] gods out of their territory.
their powers [[power]] are limited according that the plague, that the scurf, that
the phthisic; one cures one sort of itch, another another: _adeo minimis
etiam rebus prava religio inserit deos?_ “at such a rate does false
religion create gods for the most contemptible uses.” this one makes
grapes grow, that onions; this has the presidence over lechery, that
over merchandise; for every sort of artisan a [[god]]; this has his province
and [[reputation]] in the east; that his in the west:--


     “here lay her armour, here her chariot stood.”

     o sancte [[apollo]], qui umbilicum certum terrarum obtines!

     “o [[sacred]] phoebus, who with glorious ray,
  from the earth’s centre, dost thy [[light]] display.”

     pallada cecropidæ, minola creta dianam,
  vulcanum tellus hypsipylea colit,
  junonem sparte, pelopeladesque mycenæ;
  pinigerum fauni mænalis ora caput;
  [[mars]] latio venerandus.

     “th’ athenians pallas, cynthia crete adore,
  vulcan is worshipped on the lemnian shore.
  proud juno’s altars are by spartans fed,
  th’ arcadians [[worship]] faunus, and ‘tis said
  to [[mars]], by [[italy]], is homage paid.”


to our necessity; this cures horses, that [[men]],


   hic illius arma, hic currus fuit.


this has only one town or [[family]] in his possession; that lives [[life]] alone;
that in company, either voluntary or upon necessity:--


      junctaque sunt magno templa nepotis avo.

      “and temples to the nephew joined are,
   to those were reared to the great-grandfather.”


in here are some so wretched and mean (for the number amounts to six and
thirty thousand) that they must pack five or six together, to produce
one ear of corn, and thence take their several names; three to a
door--that of the plank, that of the hinge, and that of the threshold.
four to a child--protectors of his swathing-clouts, his drink, meat, and
sucking. some [[certain]], some uncertain and doubtful, and some that are
not yet entered paradise:--


      quos, quoniam coli nondum dignamur honore,
   quas dedimus certè terras habitare sinanras:

      “whom, since we yet not worthy [[think]] of [[heaven]],
   we suffer to possess the [[earth]] we’ve given.”


there are amongst them physicians, poets, and civilians. some of a
mean betwixt the [[divine]] and [[human]] [[nature]]; mediators betwixt [[god]] and us,
adorned with a [[certain]] second and diminutive sort of adoration; infinite
in titles and offices; some [[good]]; others ill; some old and decrepit,
and some that are mortal. for chrysippus was of [[opinion]] that in the last
conflagration of the [[world]] all the gods were to [[die]] but [[jupiter]]. man
makes a thousand pretty societies [[society]] betwixt [[god]] and him; is he not his
countryman?


   jovis incunabula creten.

   “crete, the cradle of [[jupiter]].”


and this is the excuse that, upon consideration of this [[subject]],
scævola, a high [[priest]], and varro, a [[great]] theologian in their times [[time]],
make us: “that it is necessary that the [[people]] should be ignorant of
many things that are true, and [[believe]] many things that are false.”
 _quum veritatem qua liberetur inquirat credatur ei expedire quod
fallitur._ “seeing he inquires into the [[truth]], by which he would be
made [[free]], ‘tis fit he should be deceived.” [[human]] [[eyes]] cannot perceive
things but by the forms they [[know]]; and we do not [[remember]] what a leap
miserable phæton took for attempting to guide his father’s horses with
a mortal hand. the [[mind]] of [[man]] falls into as [[great]] a depth, and is after
the same manner bruised and shattered by his own rashness. if you ask of
philosophy of what matter the heavens [[heaven]] and the sun are? what [[answer]] will
she return, if not that it is iron, or, with anaxagoras, stone, or some
other matter that she makes use of? if a [[man]] inquire of zeno what nature
is? “a [[fire]],” says he, “an artisan, proper for [[generation]], and regularly
proceeding.” archimedes, master of that [[science]] which attributes to
itself the precedency before all others for [[truth]] and certainty;
“the sun,” says he, “is a [[god]] of red-hot iron.” was not this a fine
imagination, extracted from the inevitable necessity of geometrical
demonstrations? yet not so inevitable and useful but that socrates
thought it was enough to [[know]] so much of geometry only as to measure the
land a [[man]] bought or sold; and that polyænus, who had been a great
and famous doctor in it, despised it, as full of falsity and manifest
vanity, after he had once tasted the delicate fruits of the lozelly
gardens of epicurus. [[socrates]] in xenophon, concerning this affair,
says of anaxagoras, reputed by antiquity learned above all others in
celestial and [[divine]] matters, “that he had cracked his brain, as all
other [[men]] do who too immoderately search into knowledges which nothing
belong to them:” when he made the sun to be a burning stone, he did not
consider that a stone does not shine in the [[fire]]; and, which is worse,
that it will there consume; and in making the sun and [[fire]] one, that
fire does not turn the complexions black in shining upon them; that
we are able to look fixedly upon [[fire]]; and that [[fire]] kills herbs and
plants. ‘tis socrates’s [[opinion]], and mine too, that the [[best]] judging
of [[heaven]] is not to [[judge]] of it at all. [[plato]] having [[occasion]], in his
_timous_, to speak of the demons, “this undertaking,” says he, “exceeds
my ability.” we are therefore to [[believe]] those ancients who said they
were begotten by them; ‘tis against all [[reason]] to refuse a man’s faith
to the [[children]] of the gods, though what they say should not be proved
by any necessary or probable reasons [[reason]]; seeing they engage to speak of
domestic and familiar things.

let us see if we have a little more [[light]] in the [[knowledge]] of [[human]] and
natural things. is it not a ridiculous attempt for us to forge for those
to whom, by our own [[confession]], our [[knowledge]] is not able to attain,
another [[body]], and to lend a false form of our own invention; as is
manifest in this motion of the planets; to which, seeing our wits
cannot possibly arrive, nor conceive their [[natural]] conduct, we lend them
material, heavy, and substantial springs of our own by which to move:--


      temo aureus, aurea summæ
   curvatura rotæ, radiorum argenteus ordo.

      “gold was the axle, and the beam was gold;
   the wheels with silver spokes on golden circles roll’d.”


you would say that we had had coachmakers, carpenters, and painters,
that went up on high to make engines of various motions, and to range
the wheelwork and interfacings of the heavenly bodies [[body]] of differing
colours about the axis of necessity, according to [[plato]]:--


      mundus domus est maxima rerum,
   quam quinque altitonæ fragmine zonæ
   cingunt, per quam limbus pictus bis [[sex]] signis
   stellimicantibus, altus in obliquo æthere, lunæ
   bigas acceptat.

      “the world’s a mansion that doth all things hold,
   which thundering zones, in number five, enfold,
   through which a girdle, painted with twelve signs,
   and that with sparkling constellations, shines,
   in heaven’s arch marks the diurnal course
   for the sun’s chariot and his fiery horse.”


these are all dreams [[dream]] and fanatic follies. why will not [[nature]] please for
once to lay open her bosom to us, and plainly discover to us the means
and conduct of her movements, and prepare our [[eyes]] to see them? good
god, what [[abuse]], what mistakes should we discover in our [[poor]] science!
i am mistaken if that [[weak]] [[knowledge]] of ours holds any one thing as it
really is, and i shall depart hence more ignorant of all other things
than my own ignorance.

have i not [[read]] in [[plato]] this [[divine]] saying, that “nature is nothing
but enigmatic poesy!” as if a [[man]] might perhaps see a veiled and shady
picture, breaking out here and there with an infinite variety of false
lights to puzzle our conjectures: _latent ista omnia crassis occullata
et circumfusa tenebris; ut nulla acies humani ingenii tanta sit, quæ
penetrare in coelum, terram intrare, possit._ “all those things lie
concealed and involved in so dark an obscurity that no point of human
wit can be so sharp as to pierce [[heaven]] or penetrate the [[earth]].” and
certainly [[philosophy]] is no other than sophisticated poetry. whence do
the ancient writers extract their authorities [[authority]] but from the poets? and
the first of them were poets themselves, and writ accordingly. [[plato]] is
but a poet unripped. timon calls him, insultingly, “a monstrous forger
of [[miracles]].” all superhuman sciences [[science]] make use of the poetic style. just
as [[women]] make use of teeth of ivory where the [[natural]] are wanting, and
instead of their true [[complexion]] make one of some artificial matter; as
they stuff themselves out with cotton to appear plump, and in the sight
of every one do paint, patch, and trick up themselves with a false and
borrowed [[beauty]]; so does [[science]] (and even our [[law]] itself has, they say,
legitimate fictions, whereon it builds the [[truth]] of its justice);
she gives us in presupposition, and for current [[pay]], things which she
herself informs us were [[invented]]; for these _epicycles, eccentrics, and
concentrics_, which astrology makes use of to carry on the motions of
the stars, she gives us for the [[best]] she could invent upon that [[subject]];
as also, in all the rest, [[philosophy]] presents [[present]] us not that which really
is, or what she really believes [[belief]], but what she has contrived with the
greatest and most plausible likelihood of [[truth]], and the quaintest
invention. [[plato]], upon the discourse of the [[state]] of [[human]] bodies [[body]] and
those of beasts, says, “i should [[know]] that what i have said is [[truth]],
had i the confirmation of an oracle; but this i will affirm, that what i
have said is the most likely to be true of any thing i could say.”

‘tis not to [[heaven]] only that art [[arts]] sends her ropes, engines, and wheels;
let us consider a little what she says of us ourselves, and of our
contexture.

there is not more retrogradation, trepidation, accession, recession, and
astonishment, in the stars and celestial bodies [[body]], than they have found
out in this [[poor]] little [[human]] [[body]]. in earnest, they have [[good]] [[reason]],
upon that very account, to call it the little [[world]], so many tools and
parts have they employed to erect and build it. to assist the motions
they see in [[man]], and the various functions that we find in ourselves, in
how many parts have they divided the [[soul]], in how many places lodged it?
in how many orders have they divided, and to how many stories have they
raised this [[poor]] creature, [[man]], besides those that are [[natural]] and to
be perceived? and how many offices and vocations have they assigned him?
they make it an imaginary [[public]] thing. ‘tis a [[subject]] that they hold
and handle; and they have full [[power]] granted to them to rip, place,
displace, piece, and stuff it, every one according to his own fancy, and
yet they possess it not they cannot, not in reality only, but even in
dreams, so govern it that there will not be some cadence or sound that
will escape their architecture, as enormous as it is, and botched with
a thousand false and fantastic patches. and it is not [[reason]] to excuse
them; for though we are satisfied with painters when they paint [[heaven]],
earth, seas, mountains, and remote islands, that they give us some
slight mark of them, and, as of things unknown, are content with a faint
and obscure description; yet when they come and draw us after [[life]], or
any other creature which is known and familiar to us, we then require of
them a [[perfect]] and exact representation of lineaments and colours, and
despise them if they fail in it.

i am very well pleased with the milesian girl, who observing the
philosopher thales to be always contemplating the celestial arch, and
to have his [[eyes]] ever gazing upward, laid something in his way that he
might stumble over, to put him in [[mind]] that it would be [[time]] to take up
his thoughts [[thought]] about things that are in the clouds when he had provided
for those that were under his feet. doubtless she advised him well,
rather to look to himself than to gaze at [[heaven]]; for, as democritus
says, by the mouth of cicero,--


   quod est ante pedes, nemo spectat: coeli scrutantur plagas.

      “no [[man]] regards what is under his feet;
   they are always prying towards [[heaven]].”


but our condition will have it so, that the [[knowledge]] of what we have in
hand is as remote from us, and as much above the clouds, as that of the
stars. as [[socrates]] says, in [[plato]], “that whoever meddles with philosophy
may be reproached as thales was by the woman, that he sees nothing of
that which is before him. for every philosopher is ignorant of what his
neighbour does; aye, and of what he does himself, and is ignorant of
what they both are, whether beasts or [[men]].”

those [[people]], who find sebond’s arguments too [[weak]], that are ignorant of
nothing, that govern the [[world]], that [[know]] all,--


      quæ mare compescant causæ; quid temperet annum;
   stellæ sponte suâ, jussæve, vagentur et errent;
   quid premat obscurum lunæ, quid proférât orbem;
   quid velit et posait rerum concordia discors;

      “what governs ocean’s tides,
   and through the various year the seasons guides;
   whether the stars by their own proper [[force]],
   or [[foreign]] [[power]], pursue their wand’ring course;
   why shadows darken the pale queen of night;
   whence she renews her orb and spreads her [[light]];--
   what nature’s jarring sympathy can mean;”


have they not sometimes in their writings sounded the difficulties they
have met with of knowing their own being? we see very well that the
finger moves, that the foot moves, that some parts assume a voluntary
motion of themselves without our [[consent]], and that others [[work]] by our
direction; that one sort of apprehension occasions [[occasion]] blushing; another
paleness; such an [[imagination]] works [[work]] upon the spleen only, another upon
the brain; one occasions [[occasion]] laughter, another tears; another stupefies and
astonishes all our senses, and arrests the motion of all our members;
at one object the stomach will rise, at another a member that lies
something lower; but how a [[spiritual]] impression should make such a
breach into a massy and solid [[subject]], and the [[nature]] of the connection
and contexture of these admirable springs and movements, never yet
man knew: _omnia incerta ratione, et in naturæ majestate abdita._ “all
uncertain in [[reason]], and concealed in the majesty of [[nature]],” says
pliny. and st augustin, _modus quo corporibus adhorent spiritus....
omnino minis est, nec comprehendi ab homine potest; et hoc ipse
homo est,_ “the manner whereby souls [[soul]] adhere to bodies [[body]] is altogether
wonderful, and cannot be conceived by [[man]], and yet this is [[man]].” and
yet it is not so much as doubted; for the opinions [[opinion]] of [[men]] are received
according to the ancient [[belief]], by [[authority]] and upon trust, as if
it were [[religion]] and [[law]]. ‘tis received as gibberish which is commonly
spoken; this [[truth]], with all its clutter of arguments and proofs, is
admitted as a firm and solid [[body]], that is no more to be shaken, no more
to be judged of; on the contrary, every one, according to the [[best]] of
his talent, corroborates and fortifies this received [[belief]] with the
utmost [[power]] of his [[reason]], which is a supple utensil, pliable, and to
be accommodated to any figure; and thus the [[world]] comes to be filled
with lies [[lie]] and fopperies. the [[reason]] that [[men]] [[doubt]] of divers things is
that they never examine [[common]] impressions; they do not dig to the root,
where the faults [[fault]] and defects [[lie]]; they only debate upon the branches;
they do not examine whether such and such a thing be true, but if it
has been so and so understood; it is not inquired into whether galen has
said any thing to [[purpose]], but whether he has said so or so. in [[truth]] it
was very [[good]] [[reason]] that this curb to the [[liberty]] of our judgments [[judgment]] and
that [[tyranny]] over our opinions [[opinion]], should be extended to the schools and
arts. the [[god]] of scholastic [[knowledge]] is [[aristotle]]; ‘tis irreligion to
question any of his decrees, as it was those of lucurgus at sparta;
his doctrine is a magisterial [[law]], which, peradventure, is as false as
another. i do not [[know]] why i should not as willingly embrace either the
ideas of [[plato]], or the atoms of epicurus, or the plenum or vacuum of
leucippus and democritus, or the water of thales, or the infinity
of [[nature]] of anaximander, or the air of diogenes, or the numbers and
symmetry of pythagoras, or the infinity of parmenides, or the one of
musæus, or the water and [[fire]] of apollodorus, or the similar parts of
anaxagoras, or the discord and [[friendship]] of empedocles, or the [[fire]] of
heraclitus, or any other [[opinion]] of that infinite confusion of opinions
and determinations, which this fine [[human]] [[reason]] produces [[produce]] by its
certitude and clearsightedness in every thing it meddles withal, as i
should the [[opinion]] of [[aristotle]] upon this [[subject]] of the principles
of [[natural]] things; which principles [[principle]] he builds of three pieces--matter,
form, and privation. and what can be more [[vain]] than to make inanity
itself the cause of the production of things? privation is a negative;
of what [[humour]] could he then make the cause and original of things that
are? and yet that were not to be controverted but for the exercise of
logic; there is nothing disputed therein to bring it into [[doubt]], but to
defend the author of the school from [[foreign]] objections; his authority
is the non-ultra, beyond which it is not permitted to inquire.

it is very easy, upon approved foundations, to build whatever we please;
for, according to the [[law]] and ordering of this beginning, the other
parts of the structure are easily carried on without any failure. by
this way we find our [[reason]] well-grounded, and discourse at a venture;
for our masters prepossess and gain beforehand as much room in our
belief as is necessary towards concluding afterwards what they
please, as geometricians do by their granted demands, the [[consent]] and
approbation we allow them giving them wherewith to draw us to the right
and left, and to whirl us about at their [[pleasure]]. whatever springs from
these presuppositions is our master and our [[god]]; he will take the level
of his foundations so ample and so easy that by them he may mount us
up to the clouds, if he so please. in this practice and negotiation
of [[science]] we have taken the saying of pythagoras, “that every expert
person ought to be believed in his own art” for current [[pay]]. the
logician refers the signification of words to the grammarians; the
rhetorician borrows the [[state]] of arguments from the logician; the poet
his measure from the musician: the geometrician his proportions from
the arithmetician, and the metaphysicians take physical conjectures for
their foundations; for every [[science]] has its [[principle]] presupposed, by
which [[human]] [[judgment]] is everywhere kept in check. if you come to rush
against the bar where the principal error lies [[lie]], they have presently this
sentence in their mouths, “that there is no disputing with persons [[person]] who
deny principles [[principle]].” now [[men]] can have no principles [[principle]] if not revealed to them
by the divinity; of all the rest the beginning, the middle, and the
end, is nothing but [[dream]] and vapour. to those that contend upon
presupposition we must, on the contrary, presuppose to them the same
axiom upon which the dispute is. for every [[human]] presupposition and
declaration has as much [[authority]] one as another, if [[reason]] do not make
the difference. wherefore they are all to be put into the balance, and
first the generals and those that tyrannize over us. the persuasion of
certainty is a [[certain]] testimony of folly and extreme incertainty;
and there are not a more foolish sort of [[men]], nor that are less
philosophers, than the philodoxes of [[plato]]; we must inquire whether fire
be hot? whether snow be [[white]]? if there be any such things as hard or
soft within our [[knowledge]]?

and as to those answers [[answer]] of which they make old stories, as he that
doubted if there was any such thing as heat, whom they bid throw himself
into the [[fire]]; and he that denied the coldness of ice, whom they bid
to put ice into his bosom;--they are pitiful things, unworthy of the
profession of [[philosophy]]. if they had let us alone in our natural
being, to receive the appearance of things without us, according as they
present themselves to us by our senses, and had permitted us to follow
our own [[natural]] appetites, governed by the condition of our birth, they
might then have [[reason]] to talk at that rate; but ‘tis from them we have
learned to make ourselves judges [[judge]] of the [[world]]; ‘tis from them that we
derive this fancy, “that [[human]] [[reason]] is controller-general of all that
is without and within the roof of [[heaven]]; that comprehends every thing,
that can do every thing; by the means of which every thing is known and
understood.” this [[answer]] would be [[good]] among the cannibals, who enjoy
the [[happiness]] of a long, quiet, and peaceable [[life]], without aristotle’s
precepts, and without the [[knowledge]] of the name of physics; this answer
would perhaps be of more value and greater [[force]] than all those they
borrow from their [[reason]] and invention; of this all animals, and all
where the [[power]] of the [[law]] of [[nature]] is yet pure and simple, would be
as capable as we, but as for them they have renounced it. they need not
tell us, “it is true, for you see and [[feel]] it to be so;” they must tell
me whether i really [[feel]] what i [[think]] i do; and if i do [[feel]] it, they
must then tell me why i [[feel]] it, and how, and what; let them tell me the
name, original, the parts and junctures of heat and cold, the qualities
of the agent and patient; or let them give up their profession, which is
not to admit or approve of any thing but by the way of [[reason]]; that is
their test in all sorts of essays; but, certainly, ‘tis a test full of
falsity, error, weakness, and defect.

which way can we [[better]] prove it than by itself? if we are not to
believe her when speaking of herself, she can hardly be [[thought]] fit to
judge of [[foreign]] things; if she [[know]] any thing, it must at least be her
own being and abode; she is in the [[soul]], and either a part or an effect
of it; for true and essential [[reason]], from which we by a false colour
borrow the name, is lodged in the bosom of the almighty; there is her
habitation and recess; ‘tis thence that she imparts her rays, when god
is pleased to impart any beam of it to [[mankind]], as balias issued from
her father’s head, to communicate herself to the [[world]].

now let us see what [[human]] [[reason]] tells us of herself and of the [[soul]],
not of the [[soul]] in general, of which almost all [[philosophy]] makes the
celestial and first bodies [[body]] participants; nor of that which thales
attributed to things which themselves are reputed inanimate, lead
thereto by the consideration of the loadstone; but of that which
appertains to us, and that we ought the [[best]] to [[know]]:--


      ignoratur enim, quæ sit natura animai;
   nata sit; an, contra, nascentibus insinuetur;
   et simnl intereat nobiscum morte dirempta;
   an tenebras orci visat, vastasque lacunas,
   an pecudes alias divinitns insinuet se.

      “for none the [[nature]] of the [[soul]] doth [[know]],
   whether that it be born with us, or no;
   or be infused into us at our birth,
   and dies with us when we return to [[earth]],
   or then descends to the black shades below,
   or into other animals does go.”


crates and dicæarchus were of [[opinion]] that there was no [[soul]] at all,
but that the [[body]] thus stirs by a [[natural]] motion; [[plato]], that it was a
substance moving of itself; thales, a [[nature]] without repose; aedepiades,
an exercising of the senses; hesiod and anaximander, a thing composed of
earth and water; parmenides, of [[earth]] and [[fire]]; empedocles, of [[blood]]:--


   sanguineam vomit ille animam;

   “he vomits up his bloody [[soul]].”


posidonius, cleanthes, and galen, that it was heat or a hot complexion--


   igneus est ollis vigor, et colestis origo;

   “their vigour of [[fire]] and of heavenly [[race]].”


hippocrates, a spirit diffused all over the [[body]]; varro, that it was an
air received at the mouth, heated in the lungs, moistened in the [[heart]],
and diffused throughout the whole [[body]]; zeno, the quintessence of the
four elements; heraclides ponticus, that it was the [[light]]; zenocrates
and the [[egyptians]], a mobile number; the chaldeans, a [[virtue]] without any
determinate form:--


      habitum quemdam vitalem corporis esse,
   harmoniam græci quam dicunt.

      “a [[certain]] vital habit in man’s frame,
   which harmony the grecian sages name.”


let us not forget [[aristotle]], who held the [[soul]] to be that which
naturally causes the [[body]] to move, which he calls entelechia, with
as cold an invention as any of the rest; for he neither speaks of the
essence, nor of the original, nor of the [[nature]] of the [[soul]], but
only takes notice of the effect lactantius, seneca, and most of the
dogmatists, have confessed that it was a thing they did not [[understand]];
after all this enumeration of opinions [[opinion]], _harum sententiarum quo vera
sit, deus aliquis viderit:_ “of these opinions [[opinion]] which is the true, let
some [[god]] determine,” says cicero. “i [[know]] by myself,” says st bernard,
“how incomprehensible [[god]] is, seeing i cannot comprehend the parts of my
own being.”

heraclitus, who was of [[opinion]] that every being was full of souls [[soul]] and
demons, did nevertheless maintain that no one could advance so far
towards the [[knowledge]] of the [[soul]] as ever to arrive at it; so profound
was the essence of it.

neither is there less controversy and debate about seating of it.
hippocrates and hierophilus place it in the ventricle of the brain;
democritus and [[aristotle]] throughout the whole [[body]];--


      ut bona sæpe valetudo cum dicitur esse
   corporis, et non est tamen hæc pars ulla ralentis;

      “as when the body’s health they do it call,
   when of a sound [[man]], that’s no part at all.”


epicurus in the stomach;


      hic exsultat enim pavor ac metus;
   hæc loca circum lætitiæ mulcent.

      “for this the seat of [[horror]] is and [[fear]],
   and joys in turn do likewise triumph here.”


the stoics, about and within the [[heart]]; erasistratus, adjoining the
membrane of the epicranium; empedocles, in the [[blood]]; as also [[moses]],
which was the [[reason]] why he interdicted eating the [[blood]] of beasts,
because the [[soul]] is there seated; galen [[thought]] that every part of the
body had its [[soul]]; strato has placed it betwixt the eyebrows; _quâ facie
quidem sit animus, aut ubi habitet, ne quorendum quidem est:_ “what
figure the [[soul]] is of, or what part it inhabits, is not to be inquired
into,” says cicero. i very willingly deliver this author to you in his
own words; for should i alter eloquence itself? besides, it were but a
poor prize to steal the matter of his inventions; they are neither
very frequent, nor of any [[great]] weight, and sufficiently known. but the
reason why chrysippus argues it to be about the [[heart]], as all the rest
of that sect do, is not to be omitted; “it is,” says he, “because when
we would affirm any things we lay our hand upon our breasts; and when
we would pronounce èyù, which signifies i, we let the lower jaw fall
towards the stomach.” this place ought not to be passed over without
a remark upon the vanity of so [[great]] a [[man]]; for besides that these
considerations are infinitely [[light]] in themselves, the [[last]] is only a
proof to the greeks [[greek]] that they have their souls [[soul]] lodged in that part. no
human [[judgment]] is so sprightly and vigilant that it does not sometimes
sleep. why do we [[fear]] to say? the stoics, the fathers [[father]] of [[human]] prudence,
think that the [[soul]] of a [[man]], crushed under a ruin, long labours
and strives to get out, like a mouse caught in a trap, before it can
disengage itself from the burden. some hold that the [[world]] was made to
give bodies [[body]], by way of [[punishment]], to the spirits fallen, by their own
fault, from the purity wherein they had been created, the first creation
having been incorporeal; and that, according as they are more or less
depraved from their spirituality, so are they more or less jocundly or
dully incorporated; and that thence proceeds all the variety of so much
created matter. but the spirit that for his [[punishment]] was invested
with the [[body]] of the sun must certainly have a very rare and particular
measure of [[change]].

the extremities of our perquisition do all fall into astonishment
and blindness; as plutarch says of the testimony of histories [[history]], that,
according to charts and maps, the utmost bounds of known r countries [[country]] are
taken up with marshes, impenetrable forests, deserts, and uninhabitable
places; this is the [[reason]] why the most gross and childish ravings were
most found in those authors who treat of the most elevated subjects [[subject]], and
proceed the furthest in them, losing themselves in their own curiosity
and presumption. the beginning and end of [[knowledge]] are equally foolish;
observe to what a pitch [[plato]] flies in his poetic clouds; do but take
notice there of the gibberish of the gods; but what did he [[dream]] of when
he defined a [[man]] to be “a two-legged animal without feathers: giving
those who had a [[mind]] to deride him a pleasant [[occasion]]; for, having
pulled a capon alive, they went about calling it the [[man]] of [[plato]].”

and what did the epicureans [[think]] of, out of what simplicity did they
first imagine that their _atoms_ that they said were bodies [[body]] having some
weight, and a [[natural]] motion downwards, had made the [[world]]; till
they were put in [[mind]], by their adversaries, that, according to this
description, it was impossible they should unite and join to one
another, their fall being so direct and perpendicular, and making so
many parallel lines throughout? wherefore there was a necessity that
they should since add a fortuitous and sideways motion, and that they
should moreover accoutre their atoms with hooked tails, by which they
might unite and cling to one another. and even then do not those that
attack them upon this second consideration put them hardly to it? “if
the atoms have by [[chance]] formed so many sorts of figures, why did it
never fall out that they made a house or a shoe? why at the same rate
should we not [[believe]] that an infinite number of [[greek]] letters,
strewed all over a [[certain]] place, might fall into the contexture of the
_iliad?_”--“whatever is capable of [[reason]],” says zeno, “is [[better]] than
that which is not capable; there is nothing [[better]] than the [[world]];
the [[world]] is therefore capable of [[reason]].” cotta, by this way of
argumentation, makes the [[world]] a mathematician; ‘and tis also made a
musician and an organist by this other argumentation of zeno: “the
whole is more than a part; we are capable of [[wisdom]], and are part of the
world; therefore the [[world]] is [[wise]].” there are infinite like examples [[example]],
not only of arguments that are false in themselves, but silly ones, that
do not hold in themselves, and that accuse their authors not so much
of ignorance as imprudence, in the reproaches the [[philosophers]] dash one
another in the teeth withal, upon their dissensions in their sects and
opinions.

whoever should bundle up a lusty faggot of the fooleries of [[human]] wisdom
would [[produce]] wonders. i willingly muster up these few for a pattern,
by a [[certain]] meaning not less profitable to consider than the most sound
and moderate instructions. let us [[judge]] by these what [[opinion]] we are to
have of [[man]], of his sense and [[reason]], when in these [[great]] persons [[person]] that
have raised [[human]] [[knowledge]] so high, so many gross mistakes and manifest
errors are to be found.

for my part, i am apt to [[believe]] that they have treated of knowledge
casually, and like a toy, with both hands; and have contended about
reason as of a [[vain]] and frivolous instrument, setting on foot all sorts
of fancies and inventions, sometimes more sinewy, and sometimes weaker.
this same [[plato]], who defines [[man]] as if he were a cock, says elsewhere,
after [[socrates]], “that he does not, in [[truth]], [[know]] what [[man]] is, and that
he is a member of the [[world]] the hardest to [[understand]].” by this variety
and instability of opinions [[opinion]], they tacitly lead us, as it were by the
hand, to this resolution of their irresolution. they profess not always
to deliver their opinions [[opinion]] barefaced and apparent to us; they have one
while disguised them in the fabulous shadows of poetry, and at another
in some other vizor; for our imperfection carries this also along with
it, that crude meat is not always proper for our stomachs; we must dry,
alter, and mix it; they do the same; they sometimes conceal their real
opinions and judgments [[judgment]], and falsify them to accommodate themselves to
the [[public]] use. they will not make an open profession of ignorance, and
of the imbecility of [[human]] [[reason]], that they may not fright [[children]];
but they sufficiently discover it to us under the appearance of a
troubled and inconstant [[science]].

i advised a [[person]] in [[italy]], who had a [[great]] [[mind]] to speak italian, that
provided he only had a [[desire]] to make himself understood, without being
ambitious in any other [[respect]] to excel, that he should only make use
of the first word that came to the tongue’s end, whether latin, french,
spanish, or gascon, and that, by adding the italian termination, he
could not fail of hitting upon some idiom of the [[country]], either tuscan,
roman, venetian, piedmontese, or neapolitan, and so fall in with some
one of those many forms. i say the same of [[philosophy]]; she has so many
faces, so much variety, and has said so many things, that all our dreams
and ravings are there to be found. [[human]] fancy can conceive nothing
good or [[bad]] that is not there: _nihil tam absurde did potest, quod non
dicatur ab aliquo philosophorum._ “nothing can be said so absurd, that
has not been said before by some of the [[philosophers]].” and i am the more
willing to expose my whimsies to the [[public]]; forasmuch as, though they
are spun out of myself, and without any pattern, i [[know]] they will be
found related to some ancient [[humour]], and some will not stick to say,
“see whence he took it!” my manners are [[natural]], i have not called in
the assistance of any discipline to erect them; but, [[weak]] as they are,
when it came into my head to lay them open to the world’s view, and that
to expose them to the [[light]] in a little more decent garb i went to adorn
them with reasons [[reason]] and examples [[example]], it was a wonder to myself accidentally
to find them conformable to so many philosophical discourses and
examples. i never knew what regimen my [[life]] was of till it was near
worn out and spent; a new figure--an unpremeditated and accidental
philosopher.

but to return to the [[soul]]. inasmuch as [[plato]] has placed [[reason]] in the
brain, anger in the [[heart]], and concupiscence in the liver; ‘tis likely
that it was rather an interpretation of the movements of

the [[soul]], than that he intended a division and separation of it, as of
a [[body]], into several members. and the most likely of their opinions
is that ‘tis always a [[soul]], that by its faculty, reasons [[reason]], remembers,
comprehends, judges [[judge]], desires [[desire]], and exercises all its other operations by
divers instruments of the [[body]]; as the pilot guides his ship according
to his [[experience]], one while straining or slacking the cordage, one
while hoisting the mainyard, or removing the rudder, by one and the same
power carrying on several effects; and that it is lodged in the brain;
which appears in that the wounds and accidents that touch that part do
immediately offend the faculties of the [[soul]]; and ‘tis not incongruous
that it should thence diffuse itself through the other parts of the body


      medium non deserit unquam
   coeli phoebus iter; radiis tamen omnia lustrât.

      “phoebus ne’er deviates from the zodiac’s way;
   yet all things doth illustrate with his ray.”


as the sun sheds from [[heaven]] its [[light]] and influence, and fills the
world with them:--


      cætera pars animas, per totum dissita corpus,
   paret, et ad numen mentis momenque movetur.

      “the other part o’ th’ [[soul]] diffus’d all o’er
   the [[body]], does obey the reason’s lore.”


some have said that there was a general [[soul]], as it were a [[great]] [[body]],
whence all the particular souls [[soul]] were extracted, and thither again
return, always restoring themselves to that universal matter:--


      deum namque ire per omnes
   terrasque, tractusque maris, columque profundum;
   hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum,
   quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas:
   scilicet hue reddi deinde, ac resoluta referri
   omnia; nec morti esse locum:

      “for [[god]] goes forth, and spreads throughout the whole
   [[heaven]], [[earth]], and sea, the universal [[soul]];
   each at its birth, from him all beings share,
   both [[man]] and brute, the breath of vital air;
   to him return, and, loos’d from earthly chain,
   fly whence they sprung, and rest in [[god]] again,
   spurn at the grave, and, fearless of decay,
   dwell in high [[heaven]], and star th’ ethereal way.”


others, that they only rejoined and reunited themselves to it; others,
that they were produced from the [[divine]] substance; others, by the angels
of [[fire]] and air; others, that they were from all antiquity; and some
that they were created at the very point of [[time]] the bodies [[body]] wanted
them; others make them to descend from the orb of the moon, and return
thither; the generality of the ancients believed that they were begotten
from [[father]] to [[son]], after a like manner, and produced with all other
natural things; taking their argument from the likeness of [[children]] to
their fathers [[father]];


      instillata patris virtus tibi;
   fortes creantur fortibus, et bonis;

      “thou hast thy father’s virtues [[virtue]] with his [[blood]]:
   for still the brave spring from the brave and [[good]];”


and that we see descend from fathers [[father]] to their [[children]] not only
bodily marks, but moreover a resemblance of humours [[humour]], complexions, and
inclinations of the [[soul]]:--


      denique cur acris violentia triste leonum
   seminium sequitur? dolus vulpibus, et fuga, cervis
   a patribus datur, et patrius pavor incitât artus?
   si non certa suo quia semine seminioque
   vis animi pariter crescit cum corpore toto.

      “for why should rage from the fierce lion’s seed,
   or from the subtle fox’s craft, proceed;
   or why the tim’rous and flying hart
   his [[fear]] and trembling to his [[race]] impart;
   but that a [[certain]] [[force]] of [[mind]] does grow,
   and still increases as the bodies [[body]] do?”


that thereupon the [[divine]] [[justice]] is grounded, punishing in the children
the faults [[fault]] of their fathers [[father]]; forasmuch as the contagion of paternal
vices is in some sort imprinted in the [[soul]] of [[children]], and that the
ill [[government]] of their will extends to them; moreover, that if souls
had any other derivation than a [[natural]] consequence, and that they had
been some other thins out of the [[body]], they would retain some memory
of their first being, the [[natural]] faculties that are proper to them of
discoursing, reasoning, and remembering, being considered:--


      si in corpus nascentibus insinuatur,
   cur super anteactam ætatem meminisse nequimus,
   nec vestigia gestarum rerum ulla tenemus?

      “for at our birth if it infused be,
   why do we then retain no memory
   of our foregoing [[life]], and why no more
   [[remember]] any thing we did before?”


for, to make the condition of our souls [[soul]] such as we would have it to be,
we must suppose them all-knowing, even in their [[natural]] simplicity and
purity; by these means they had been such, being [[free]] from the prison of
the [[body]], as well before they entered into it, as we [[hope]] they shall be
after they are gone out of it; and from this [[knowledge]] it should follow
that they should [[remember]], being got in the [[body]], as [[plato]] said, “that
what we learn is no other than a remembrance of what we knew before;” a
thing which every one by [[experience]] may maintain to be false. forasmuch,
in the first place, as that we do not justly [[remember]] any thing but
what we have been taught, and that if the memory did purely perform its
office it would at least suggest to us something more than what we have
learned. secondly, that which she knew being in her purity, was a
true [[knowledge]], knowing things as they are by her [[divine]] [[intelligence]];
whereas here we make her receive falsehood and [[vice]] when we instruct
her; wherein she cannot employ her reminiscence, that image and
conception having never been planted in her. to say that the corporal
prison does in such sort suffocate her [[natural]] faculties, that they
are there utterly extinct, is first contrary to this other [[belief]] of
acknowledging her [[power]] to be so [[great]], and the operations of it that
men sensibly perceive in this [[life]] so admirable, as to have thereby
concluded that divinity and eternity [[past]], and the immortality to
come:--


      nam si tantopere est anirai mutata potestas,
   omnia ut actarum exciderit retinentia rerum,
   non, ut opinor, ea ab letho jam longior errat.

      “for if the [[mind]] be changed to that degree
   as of [[past]] things to lose all memory,
   so [[great]] a [[change]] as that, i must confess,
   appears to me than [[death]] but little less.”


furthermore, ‘tis here with us, and not elsewhere, that the force
and effects of the [[soul]] ought to be considered; all the rest of her
perfections are [[vain]] and useless to her; ‘tis by her [[present]] condition
that all her immortality is to be rewarded and paid, and of the [[life]] of
man only that she is to render an account it had been [[injustice]] to have
stripped her of her means and powers [[power]]; to have disarmed her in order, in
the [[time]] of her captivity and imprisonment in the flesh, of her weakness
and infirmity in the [[time]] wherein she was forced and compelled, to pass
an infinite and perpetual sentence and condemnation, and to insist upon
the consideration of so short a [[time]], peradventure but an hour or two,
or at the most but a century, which has no more proportion with infinity
than an instant; in this momentary interval to ordain and definitively
to determine of her whole being; it were an unreasonable disproportion,
too, to assign an eternal recompense in consequence of so short a [[life]].
plato, to defend himself from this inconvenience, will have future
payments limited to the term of a hundred years, relatively to human
duration; and of us ourselves there are enough who have given them
temporal limits. by this they judged that the [[generation]] of the soul
followed the [[common]] condition of [[human]] things, as also her [[life]],
according to the [[opinion]] of epicurus and democritus, which has been the
most received; in consequence of these fine appearances that they saw
it bom, and that, according as the [[body]] grew more capable, they saw it
increase in vigour as the other did; that its feebleness in infancy was
very manifest, and in [[time]] its [[better]] [[strength]] and maturity, and after
that its declension and old [[age]], and at [[last]] its decrepitude:--


      gigni pariter cum corpore, et una
   crescere sentimus, pariterque senescere mentem.

      “souls with the bodies [[body]] to be born we may
   discern, with them t’ increase, with them decay.”


they perceived it to be capable of divers [[passions]], and agitated with
divers painful motions, whence it fell into lassitude and uneasiness;
capable of alteration and [[change]], of cheerfulness, of stupidity and
languor, and [[subject]] to diseases and injuries, as the stomach or the
foot;


      mentem sanari, corpus ut ægrum,
   ceraimus, et flecti medicinâ posse videmus;

      “sick minds [[mind]], as well as bodies [[body]], we do see
   by med’cine’s [[virtue]] oft restored to be;”


dazzled and intoxicated with the fumes of wine, jostled from her seat by
the vapours of a burning fever, laid asleep by the application of some
medicaments, and roused by others,--


      corpoream naturam animi esse necesse est,
   corporeis quoniam telis ictuque laborat;

      “there must be of necessity, we find,
   a [[nature]] that’s corporeal of the [[mind]],
   because we evidently see it smarts
   and wounded is with shafts the [[body]] darts;”


they saw it astonished and overthrown in all its faculties through the
mere bite of a mad dog, and in that condition to have no stability
of [[reason]], no sufficiency, no [[virtue]], no philosophical resolution, no
resistance that could exempt it from the subjection of such accidents;
the slaver of a contemptible cur shed upon the hand of [[socrates]], to
shake all his [[wisdom]] and all his [[great]] and regulated imaginations [[imagination]], and
so to annihilate them, ad that there remained no trace of his former
knowledge,--


      vis.... animal conturbatur, et.... divisa seorsum
   disjectatur, eodem illo distracta veneno;

      “the [[power]] of the soul’s disturbed; and when
   that once is but sequestered from her, then
   by the same poison ‘tis dispersed abroad;”


and this poison to find no more [[resistance]] in that [[great]] [[soul]] than in an
infant of four years old; a poison sufficient to make all [[philosophy]], if
it were incarnate, become furious and mad; insomuch that cato, who
ever disdained [[death]] and [[fortune]], could not endure the sight of a
looking-glass, or of water, overwhelmed with [[horror]] and affright at
the [[thought]] of falling, by the contagion of a mad dog, into the disease
called by physicians hydrophobia:--


      vis morbi distracta per artus
   turbat agens animam, spumantes æquore salso
   ventorum ut validis fervescunt viribus undæ.

      “throughout the limbs diffused, the fierce disease
   disturbs the [[soul]], as in the briny seas,
   the foaming waves to swell and boil we see,
   stirred by the wind’s impetuosity.”


now, as to this particular, [[philosophy]] has sufficiently armed [[man]] to
encounter all other accidents either with patience, or, if the search
of that costs too dear, by an infallible defeat, in totally depriving
himself of all sentiment; but these are expedients that are only of use
to a [[soul]] being itself, and in its full [[power]], capable of [[reason]] and
deliberation; but not at all proper for this inconvenience, where, in
a philosopher, the [[soul]] becomes the [[soul]] of a madman, troubled,
overturned, and lost; which many occasions [[occasion]] may [[produce]], as a too
vehement agitation that any [[violent]] passion of the [[soul]] may beget in
itself; or a wound in a [[certain]] part of the [[person]], or vapours from the
stomach, any of which may stupefy the understanding and turn the brain.


      morbis in corporis avius errat
   sæpe animus; dementit enim, deliraque fatur;
   interdumque gravi lethargo fertur in altum
   æternumque soporem, oculis mi tuque cadenti:

      “for when the body’s sick, and ill at ease,
   the [[mind]] doth often share in the disease;
   wonders, grows wild, and raves, and sometimes by
   a heavy and a stupid lethargy,
   is overcome and cast into a deep,
   a most profound and everlasting sleep.”


the [[philosophers]], methinks, have not much touched this string, no more
than another of [[equal]] importance; they have this dilemma continually
in their mouths, to console our mortal condition: “the [[soul]] is either
mortal or [[immortal]]; if mortal, it will suffer no [[pain]]; if [[immortal]], it
will [[change]] for the [[better]].”--they never touch the other branch, “what
if she [[change]] for the worse?” and leave to the poets the menaces of
future torments. but thereby they make themselves a [[good]] game. these are
two omissions that i often meet with in their discourses. i return to
the first.

this [[soul]] loses the use of the [[sovereign]] stoical [[good]], so constant and
so firm. our fine [[human]] [[wisdom]] must here yield, and give up her arms. as
to the rest, they also considered, by the vanity of [[human]] [[reason]], that
the mixture and association of two so contrary things as the mortal and
the [[immortal]], was unimaginable:--


      quippe etenim mortale æterao jungere, et una
   consentire putare, et fungi mutua posse,
   desipere est. quid enim diversius esse putandum est,
   aut magis inter se disjunctum discrepitansque,
   quam, mortale quod est, immortali atque perenni
   junctum, in concilio, sævas tolerare procellas?

      “the mortal and th’ eternal, then, to blend,
   and [[think]] they can pursue one [[common]] end,
   is madness: for what things more diff’rent are.
   distinct in [[nature]], and disposed to jar?
   how can it then be [[thought]] that these should bear,
   when thus conjoined, of harms an [[equal]] share?”


moreover, they perceived the [[soul]] tending towards [[death]] as well as the
body:--


   simul ovo fessa fatiscit:

   “fatigued together with the weight of years:”


which, according to zeno, the image of sleep does sufficiently
demonstrate to us; for he looks upon it “as a fainting and fall of the
soul, as well as of the [[body]]:” _contrahi animum et quasi labi putat
atque decidere:_ and, what they perceived in some, that the soul
maintained its [[force]] and vigour to the [[last]] gasp of [[life]], they
attributed to the variety of diseases, as it is observable in [[men]] at the
last extremity, that some retain one sense, and some another; one
the hearing, and another the smell, without any manner of defect or
alteration; and that there is not so universal a deprivation that some
parts do not remain vigorous and entire:--


      non alio pacto, quam si, pes cum dolet ægri,
   in nullo caput interea sit forte dolore.

      “so, often of the gout a [[man]] complains,
   whose head is, at the same [[time]], [[free]] from pains [[pain]].”


the sight of our [[judgment]] is, to [[truth]], the same that the owl’s eyes
are to the splendour of the sun, says [[aristotle]]. by what can we better
convince him, than by so gross blindness in so apparent a [[light]]? for the
contrary [[opinion]] of the immortality of the [[soul]], which, cicero says,
was first introduced, according to the testimony of books [[book]] at least, by
pherecydes

syrius, in the [[time]] of [[king]] tullus (though some attribute it to thales,
and others to others), ‘tis the part of [[human]] [[science]] that is treated of
with the [[greatest]] [[doubt]] and

reservation. the most positive dogmatists are fain, in this point
principally, to fly to the refuge of the academy. no one doubts [[doubt]] what
aristotle has established upon this [[subject]], no more than all the
ancients in general, who handle it with a wavering [[belief]]: _rem
gratissimam promittentium magis quam probantium:_ “a thing more
acceptable in the promisors than the provers.” he conceals himself in
clouds of words of difficult, unintelligible sense, and has left to
those of his sect as [[great]] a dispute about his [[judgment]] as about the
matter itself.

two things rendered this [[opinion]] plausible to them; one, that, without
the immortality of souls [[soul]], there would be nothing whereon to ground the
vain hopes [[hope]] of [[glory]], which is a consideration of wonderful

repute in the [[world]]; the other, that it is a very profitable impression,
as [[plato]] says, that vices [[vice]], when they escape the discovery and cognizance
of [[human]] [[justice]], are still within the reach of the [[divine]], which will
pursue them even after the [[death]] of the guilty. [[man]] is excessively
solicitous to prolong his being, and has to the utmost of his power
provided for it; there are monuments for the conservation of the [[body]],
and [[glory]] to preserve the name. he has employed all his wit and opinion
to the rebuilding of himself, impatient of his [[fortune]], and to prop
himself by his inventions. the [[soul]], by [[reason]] of its [[anxiety]] and
impotence, being unable to stand by itself, wanders up and down to seek
out consolations, hopes [[hope]], and foundations, and alien circumstances, to
which she adheres and fixes; and how [[light]] or fantastic soever invention
delivers them to her, relies more willingly, and with greater assurance,
upon them than upon herself. but ‘tis wonderful to observe how the most
constant and obstinate maintainers of this just and clear persuasion
of the immortality of the [[soul]] fall short, and how [[weak]] their arguments
are, when they go about to prove it by [[human]] [[reason]]: _somnia sunt non
docentis, sed optantis:_ “they are dreams [[dream]], not of the teacher, but
wisher,” says one of the ancients. by which testimony [[man]] may [[know]] that
he owes the [[truth]] he himself finds out to [[fortune]] and accident; since
that even then, when it is fallen into his hand, he has not wherewith to
hold and maintain it, and that his [[reason]] has not [[force]] to make use of
it. all things produced by our own meditation and understanding, whether
true or false, are [[subject]] to incertitude and controversy. ‘twas for
the chastisement of our [[pride]], and for the instruction of our miserable
condition and incapacity, that [[god]] wrought the perplexity and confusion
of the tower of babel. whatever we undertake without his assistance,
whatever we see without the lamp of his grace, is but vanity and folly.
we [[corrupt]] the very essence of [[truth]], which is uniform and constant,
by our weakness, when [[fortune]] puts it into our possession. what course
soever [[man]] takes of himself, [[god]] still permits it to come to the same
confusion, the image whereof he so lively represents to us in the just
chastisement wherewith he crushed nimrod’s presumption, and frustrated
the [[vain]] attempt of his proud structure; _perdam sapientiam sapientium,
et prudentiam prudentium reprobabo._ “i will [[destroy]] the [[wisdom]] of the
wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.” the
diversity of idioms and tongues, with which he disturbed this [[work]],
what are they other than this infinite and perpetual alteration and
discordance of opinions [[opinion]] and reasons [[reason]], which accompany and confound the
vain building of [[human]] [[wisdom]], and to very [[good]] effect too; for what
would hold us, if we had but the least grain of [[knowledge]]? this saint
has very much obliged me: _ipsa veritatis occultatio ant humili-tatis
exercitatio est, aut elationis attritio_ “the very concealment of the
truth is either an exercise of [[humility]] or a quelling of presumption.”
 to what a pitch of presumption and insolence do we raise our blindness
and folly!

but to return to my [[subject]]. it was truly very [[good]] [[reason]] that we
should be beholden to [[god]] only, and to the favour of his grace, for the
truth of so [[noble]] a [[belief]], since from his sole bounty we receive
the fruit of immortality, which consists in the enjoyment of eternal
beatitude. let us ingenuously confess that [[god]] alone has dictated it
to us, and [[faith]]; for ‘tis no lesson of [[nature]] and our own [[reason]].
and whoever will inquire into his own being and [[power]], both within
and without, without this [[divine]] [[privilege]]; whoever shall consider
man impartially, and without [[flattery]], will see in him no efficacy or
faculty that relishes of any thing but [[death]] and [[earth]]. the more we
give and confess to owe and render to [[god]], we do it with the greater
christianity. that which this stoic philosopher says he holds from the
fortuitous [[consent]] of the popular voice; had it not been [[better]] that he
had held it from [[god]]? _cum de animarum otemitate disserimus, non leve
momentum apud nos habet consensus hominum aut timentium inferos, aut
colentium. utor hâc publicâ persuasione._ “when we discourse of the
immortality of souls [[soul]], the [[consent]] of [[men]] that either [[fear]] or adore the
infernal powers [[power]], is of no small advantage. i make use of this public
persuasion.” now the weakness of [[human]] arguments upon this subject
is particularly manifested by the fabulous circumstances they have
superadded as consequences of this [[opinion]], to find out of what
condition this immortality of ours was. let us omit the stoics, (_usuram
nobis largiuntur tanquam cornicibus; diu mansuros aiunt animos; semper,
negant._ “they give us a long [[life]], as also they do to crows; they say
our [[soul]] shall continue long, but that it shall continue always they
deny,”) who give to souls [[soul]] a [[life]] after this, but finite. the most
universal and received fancy, and that continues down to our times [[time]] in
various places, is that of which they make pythagoras the author; not
that he was the original inventor, but because it received a [[great]] deal
of weight and repute by the [[authority]] of his approbation: “that souls [[soul]],
at their departure out of us, did nothing but shift from one [[body]] to
another, from a lion to a horse, from a horse to a [[king]], continually
travelling at this rate from habitation to habitation;” and he himself
said that he remembered he had been ætha-lides, since that euphorbus,
afterwards hermotimus, and, finally, from pyrrhus was passed into
pythagoras; having a memory of himself of two hundred and six years. and
some have added that these very souls [[soul]] sometimes mount up to [[heaven]], and
come down again:--


      o pater, aime aliquas ad colum hinc ire putandum est
   sublimes animas, iterumque ad tarda reverti
   corpora? quæ lucis miseris tam dira cupido?

      “o, [[father]], is it then to be conceiv’d
   that any of these spirits, so sublime,
   should hence to the celestial regions climb,
   and thence return to [[earth]] to reassume
   their sluggish bodies [[body]] rotting in a tomb?
   for wretched [[life]] whence does such fondness come?”


origen makes them eternally to go and come from a [[better]] to a worse
estate. the [[opinion]] that varro mentions is that, after four hundred and
forty years’ [[revolution]], they should be reunited to their first bodies [[body]];
chrysippus held that this would happen after a [[certain]] space of time
unknown and unlimited. [[plato]], who professes to have embraced this belief
from pindar and the ancient poets, that we are to undergo infinite
vicissitudes of mutation, for which the [[soul]] is prepared, having neither
punishment nor [[reward]] in the other [[world]] but what is temporal, as its
life here is but temporal, concludes that it has a singular [[knowledge]] of
the affairs of [[heaven]], of hell, of the [[world]], through all which it has
passed, repassed, and made stay in several voyages, are matters for her
memory. observe her [[progress]] elsewhere: “the [[soul]] that has lived well
is reunited to the stars to which it is assigned; that which has lived
ill removes into a woman, and if it do not there reform, is again
removed into a beast of condition suitable to its vicious manners, and
shall see no end of its punishments [[punishment]] till it be returned to its natural
constitution, and that it has, by the [[force]] of [[reason]], purged itself
from those gross, stupid, and elementary qualities it was polluted
with.” but i will not omit the objection the epicureans make against
this transmigration from one [[body]] to another; ‘tis a pleasant one; they
ask what expedient would be found out if the number of the dying should
chance to be greater than that of those who are coming into the [[world]].
for the souls [[soul]], turned out of their old habitation, would scuffle and
crowd which should first get possession of their new lodging; and they
further demand how they shall pass away their [[time]], whilst waiting
till new quarters are made ready for them? or, on the contrary, if more
animals should be born than [[die]], the [[body]], they say, would be but in an
ill condition whilst waiting for a [[soul]] to be infused into it; and it
would fall out that some bodies [[body]] would [[die]] before they had been alive.


      denique comrabia ad veneris, partusque ferarum
   esse animas præsto, deridiculum esse videtur;
   et spectare immortales mortalia membra
   innumero numéro, certareque præproperanter
   inter se, quæ prima potissimaqæ insinueter.

      “absurd to [[think]] that whilst wild beasts beget,
   or bear their [[young]], a thousand souls [[soul]] do wait,
   expect the falling [[body]], [[fight]] and strive
   which first shall enter in and make it [[live]].”


others have arrested the [[soul]] in the [[body]] of the deceased, with it to
animate serpents, worms, and other beasts, which are said to be bred
out of the [[corruption]] of our members, and even out of our ashes; others
divide them into two parts, the one mortal, the other [[immortal]]; others
make it corporeal, and nevertheless [[immortal]]. some make it [[immortal]],
without

sense or [[knowledge]]. there are others, even among ourselves, who have
believed that devils [[devil]] were made of the souls [[soul]] of the damned; as plutarch
thinks that gods were made of those that were saved; for there are few
things which that author is so positive in as he is in this; maintaining
elsewhere a doubtful and ambiguous way of expression. “we are told,”
 says he, “and steadfastly should [[believe]], that the souls [[soul]] of virtuous
men, both according to [[nature]] and the [[divine]] [[justice]], become saints, and
from saints demigods, and from demigods, after they are perfectly, as in
sacrifices of purgation, cleansed and purified, being delivered from all
passibility and all [[mortality]], they become, not by any civil decree, but
in real [[truth]], and according to all probability of [[reason]], entire and
perfect gods, in receiving a most [[happy]] and glorious end.” but who
desires to see him--him, who is yet the most sober and moderate of the
whole gang of [[philosophers]], lay about him with greater boldness, and
relate his [[miracles]] upon this [[subject]], i refer him to his treatise _of
the moon,_ and _of the demon of socrates_, where he may, as evidently
as in any other place whatever, satisfy himself that the mysteries of
philosophy have many [[strange]] things in [[common]] with those of poetry;
human understanding losing itself in attempting to sound and search all
things to the bottom; even as we, tired and worn out with a long course
of [[life]], return to infancy and dotage. see here the fine and certain
instructions which we extract from [[human]] [[knowledge]] concerning the [[soul]].

neither is there less temerity in what they [[teach]] us touching our
corporal parts. let us choose out one or two examples [[example]]; for otherwise we
should lose ourselves in this vast and troubled ocean of medical errors.
let us first [[know]] whether, at least, they agree about the matter whereof
men [[produce]] one another; for as to their first production it is
no wonder if, in a thing so high and so long since [[past]], human
understanding finds itself puzzled and perplexed. archelaus, the
physician, whose disciple and favourite [[socrates]] was, according to
aristoxenus, said that both [[men]] and beasts were made of a lacteous
slime, expressed by the heat of the [[earth]]; pythagoras says that our
seed is the foam or cream of our [[better]] [[blood]]; [[plato]], that it is the
distillation of the marrow of the backbone; raising his argument from
this, that that part is first sensible of being weary of the [[work]];
alcmeon, that it is part of the substance of the brain, and that it
is so, says he, is proved by the weakness of the [[eyes]] in those who
are immoderate in that exercise; democritus, that it is a substance
extracted from the whole mass of the [[body]]; epicurus, an extract from
soul and [[body]]; [[aristotle]], an excrement drawn from the aliment of the
blood, the [[last]] which is diffused over our members; others, that it is
a [[blood]] concocted and digested by the heat of the genitals, which they
judge, by [[reason]] that in excessive endeavours a [[man]] voids pure [[blood]];
wherein there seems to be more likelihood, could a [[man]] extract any
appearance from so infinite a confusion. now, to bring this seed to do
its [[work]], how many contrary opinions [[opinion]] do they set on foot? aristotle
and democritus are of [[opinion]] that [[women]] have no sperm, and that ‘tis
nothing but a sweat that they distil in the heat of [[pleasure]] and
motion, and that contributes nothing at all to [[generation]]. galen, on
the contrary, and his followers, [[believe]] that without the concurrence
of seeds there can be no [[generation]]. here are the physicians, the
philosophers, the lawyers, and divines, by the ears with our wives [[wife]] about
the dispute, “for what term [[women]] carry their fruit?” and i, for my
part, by the [[example]] of myself, stick with those that maintain a woman
goes eleven months with child. the [[world]] is built upon this [[experience]];
there is no so commonplace a woman that cannot give her [[judgment]] in all
these controversies; and yet we cannot agree.

here is enough to verify that [[man]] is no [[better]] instructed in the
knowledge of himself, in his corporal than in his [[spiritual]] part we have
proposed himself to himself, and his [[reason]] to his [[reason]], to see what
she could say. i [[think]] i have sufficiently demonstrated how little
she understands herself in herself; and who understands not himself in
himself, in what can he? _quasi vero mensuram ullius rei possit agere,
qui sui nesciat._ “as if he could [[understand]] the measure of any other
thing, that knows [[know]] not his own.” in earnest, protagoras told us a pretty
flam in making [[man]] the measure of all things, that never knew so much as
his own; and if it be not he, his [[dignity]] will not permit that any
other creature should have this advantage; now he being so contrary
in himself, and one [[judgment]] so incessantly subverting another, this
favourable proposition was but a mockery, which induced us necessarily
to conclude the nullity of the compass and the compasser. when thales
reputes the [[knowledge]] of [[man]] very difficult for [[man]] to comprehend, he
at the same [[time]] gives him to [[understand]] that all other [[knowledge]] is
impossible.

you,* for whom i have taken the pains [[pain]], contrary to my custom, to write
so long a discourse, will not refuse to support your sebond by the
ordinary forms of arguing, wherewith you are every day instructed, and
in this will exercise both your wit and learning; for this [[last]] fencing
trick is never to be made use of but as an extreme remedy; ‘tis a
desperate thrust, wherein you are to quit your own arms to make your
adversary abandon his; and a secret sleight, which must be very rarely,
and then very reservedly, put in practice. ‘tis [[great]] temerity to lose
yourself that you may [[destroy]] another; you must not [[die]] to be revenged,
as gobrias did; for, being closely grappled in combat with a [[lord]] of
persia, darius coming in [[sword]] in hand, and fearing to strike lest he
should kill gobrias, he called out to him boldly to fall on,


   * the author, as we have already mentioned, is addressing
     margaret de valois.


though he should run them both through at once. i have known desperate
weapons, and conditions of [[single]] combat, and wherein he that offered
them put himself and his adversary upon terms of inevitable [[death]] to
them both, censured for [[unjust]]. the portuguese, in the [[indian]] sea, took
certain turks prisoners [[prisoner]], who, impatient of their captivity, resolved,
and it succeeded, by striking the nails of the ship one against another,
and making a spark to fall into the barrels of powder that were set in
the place where they were guarded, to blow up and reduce themselves,
their masters, and the vessel to ashes. we here touch the out-plate
and utmost limits of sciences [[science]], wherein the extremity is vicious, as
in [[virtue]]. keep yourselves in the [[common]] road; it is not [[good]] to be so
subtle and cunning. [[remember]] the tuscan proverb:--


   chi troppo s’assottiglia, si scavezza.

   “who makes himself too [[wise]], becomes a [[fool]].”


i advise you that, in all your opinions [[opinion]] and discourses, as well as
in your manners and all other things, you keep yourself moderate and
temperate, and avoid novelty; i am an [[enemy]] to all extravagant ways.
you, who by the [[authority]] of your grandeur, and yet more by the
advantages which those qualities give you that are more your own, may
with the twinkle of an eye command whom you please, ought to have given
this charge to some one who made profession of letters, who might after
a [[better]] manner have proved and illustrated these things to you. but
here is as much as you will stand in need of.

epicurus said of the laws [[law]], “that the worst were so necessary for us that
without them [[men]] would devour one another.” and [[plato]] affirms, “that
without laws [[law]] we should [[live]] like beasts.” our wit is a wandering,
dangerous, and temerarious utensil; it is hard to couple any order or
measure to it; in those of our own [[time]], who are endued with any rare
excellence above others, or any extraordinary vivacity of understanding,
we see them almost all lash out into licentiousness of opinions [[opinion]] and
manners; and ‘tis almost a miracle to find one temperate and sociable.
‘tis all the [[reason]] in the [[world]] to limit [[human]] wit within the strictest
limits imaginable; in study, as in all the rest, we ought to have
its steps and advances numbered and fixed, and that the limits of its
inquisition be bounded by art [[arts]]. it is curbed and fettered by religions [[religion]],
laws, customs, sciences [[science]], precepts, mortal and [[immortal]] penalties. and
yet we see that it escapes from all these bonds by its volubility and
dissolution; *tis a [[vain]] [[body]] which has nothing to lay hold on or to
seize; a various and difform [[body]], incapable of being either bound
or held. in earnest, there are few souls [[soul]] so regular, firm, and well
descended, as are to be trusted with their own conduct, and that can
with moderation, and without temerity, sail in the [[liberty]] of their own
judgments, beyond the [[common]] and received opinions [[opinion]]; *tis more expedient
to put them under pupilage. wit is a dangerous weapon, even to the
possessor, if he knows [[know]] not how to use it discreetly; and there is not a
beast to whom a headboard is more justly to be given, to keep his looks
down and before his feet, and to hinder him from wandering here and
there out of the tracks which custom and the laws [[law]] have laid before him.
and therefore it will be [[better]] for you to keep yourself in the beaten
path, let it be what it will, than to fly out at a venture with this
unbridled [[liberty]]. but if any of these new doctors will pretend to be
ingenious in your presence, at the expense both of your [[soul]] and his
own, to avoid this dangerous plague, which is every day laid in your
way to infect you, this preservative, in the extremest necessity,
will prevent the danger and hinder the contagion of this poison from
offending either you or your company.

the [[liberty]], then, and frolic forwardness of these ancient wits produced
in [[philosophy]] and [[human]] sciences [[science]] several sects of different opinions [[opinion]],
every one undertaking to [[judge]] and make [[choice]] of what he would stick
to and maintain. but now that [[men]] go all one way, _qui certis quibusdam
destinatisque sententiis addicti et consecrati sunt, ut etiam, quæ non
probant, cogantur defendere,_ “who are so tied and obliged to certain
opinions that they are bound to defend even those they do not approve,”
 and that we receive the [[arts]] by civil [[authority]] and decree, so that the
schools have but one pattern, and a like circumscribed institution and
discipline, we no more take notice what the coin weighs, and is really
worth, but every one receives it according to the estimate that common
approbation and use puts upon it; the alloy is not questioned, but how
much it is current for. in like manner all things pass; we take
physic as we do geometry; and tricks of hocus-pocus, enchantments,
and love-spells, the correspondence of the souls [[soul]] of the [[dead]],
prognostications, domifications, and even this ridiculous pursuit of the
philosophers’ stone, all things pass for current [[pay]], without any manner
of scruple or contradiction. we need to [[know]] no more but that mars’
house is in the middle of the triangle of the hand, that of [[venus]] in
the thumb, and that of mercury in the little finger; that when the
table-line cuts the tubercle of the forefinger ‘tis a sign of [[cruelty]],
that when it falls short of the middle finger, and that the natural
median-line makes an angle with the vital in the same side, ‘tis a sign
of a miserable [[death]]; that if in a woman the [[natural]] line be open, and
does not close the angle with the vital, this denotes that she shall not
be very chaste. i leave you to [[judge]] whether a [[man]] qualified with such
knowledge may not pass with [[reputation]] and esteem in all companies.

theophrastus said that [[human]] [[knowledge]], guided by the senses, might
judge of the causes of things to a [[certain]] [[degree]]; but that being
arrived to first and extreme causes, it must stop short and retire, by
reason either of its own infirmity or the difficulty of things. ‘tis a
moderate and gentle [[opinion]], that our own understandings may conduct
us to the [[knowledge]] of some things, and that it has [[certain]] measures
of [[power]], beyond which ‘tis temerity to employ it; this [[opinion]] is
plausible, and introduced by [[men]] of well composed minds [[mind]], but ‘tis hard
to limit our wit, which is [[curious]] and greedy, and will no more stop
at a thousand than at fifty paces; having experimentally found that,
wherein one has failed, the other has hit, and that what was unknown to
one [[age]], the [[age]] following has explained; and that [[arts]] and sciences [[science]] are
not cast in a mould, but are formed and perfected by degrees [[degree]], by often
handling and polishing, as bears leisurely lick their cubs into form;
what my [[force]] cannot discover, i do not yet desist to sound and to try;
and by handling and kneading this new matter over and over again, by
turning and heating it, i lay open to him that shall succeed me, a kind
of facility to enjoy it more at his ease, and make it more maniable and
supple for him,


        ut hymettia sole
     cera remollescit, tractataque poll ice multas
     vertitur in facies, ipsoque fit utilis usu;

        “as wax doth softer in the sun become,
     and, tempered ‘twixt the finger and the thumb,
     will varions forms, and several shapes admit,
     till for the [[present]] use ‘tis rendered fit;”


as much will the second do for the third; which is the cause that
the difficulty ought not to make me despair, and my own incapacity as
little; for ‘tis nothing but my own.

man is as capable of all things as of some; and if he confesses, as
theophrastus says, the ignorance of first causes, let him at once
surrender all the rest of his [[knowledge]]; if he is defective in
foundation, his [[reason]] is aground; disputation and inquiry have no other
aim nor stop but principles [[principle]]; if this aim do not stop his [[career]], he
runs into an infinite irresolution. _non potest aliud alio magis minusve
comprehendi, quoniam omnium rerum una est dejinitio comprehendendi:_

“one thing can no more or less be comprehended than another, because
the definition of comprehending all things is the same.” now ‘tis very
likely that, if the [[soul]] knew any thing, it would in the first place
know itself; and if it knew any thing out of itself, it would be its own
body and case, before any thing else. if we see the gods of physic to
this very day debating about our anatomy,


   mulciber in trojam, pro trojâ stabat [[apollo]];

   “vulcan against, for troy [[apollo]] stood;”


when are we to expect that they will be agreed? we are nearer neighbours
to ourselves than whiteness to snow, or weight to stones. if [[man]] do not
know himself, how should he [[know]] his [[force]] and functions? it is not,
perhaps, that we have not some real [[knowledge]] in us; but ‘tis by [[chance]];
forasmuch as errors are received into our [[soul]] by the same way, after
the same manner, and by the same conduct, it has not wherewithal to
distinguish them, nor wherewithal to choose the [[truth]] from falsehood.

the academics admitted a [[certain]] partiality of [[judgment]], and [[thought]] it
too crude to say that it was not more likely to say that snow was white
than black; and that we were no more assured of the motion of a stone,
thrown by the hand, than of that of the eighth sphere. and to avoid
this difficulty and strangeness, that can in [[truth]] hardly lodge in our
imagination, though they concluded that we were in no sort capable of
knowledge, and that [[truth]] is engulfed in so profound an abyss as is not
to be penetrated by [[human]] sight; yet they acknowledged some things to be
more likely than others, and received into their [[judgment]] this faculty,
that they had a [[power]] to incline to one appearance more than another,
they allowed him this propension, interdicting all resolution. the
pyrrhonian [[opinion]] is more bold, and also somewhat more likely; for this
academic inclination, and this propension to one proposition rather than
another, what is it other than a recognition of some more apparent
truth in this than in that? if our understanding be capable of the form,
lineaments, port, and face of [[truth]], it might as well see it entire as
by halves, springing and imperfect this appearance of likelihood,
which makes them rather take the left hand than the [[right]], augments
it; multiply this ounce of verisimilitude that turns the scales to
a hundred, to a thousand, ounces; it will happen in the end that the
balance will itself end the controversy, and determine one [[choice]], one
entire [[truth]]. but why do they suffer themselves to incline to and be
swayed by verisimilitude, if they [[know]] not the [[truth]]? how should they
know the similitude of that whereof they do not [[know]] the essence? either
we can absolutely [[judge]], or absolutely we cannot if our intellectual and
sensible faculties are without foot or foundation, if they only pull
and drive, ‘tis to no [[purpose]] that we suffer our judgments [[judgment]] to be carried
away with any part of their operation, what appearance soever they
may seem to [[present]] us; and the surest and most [[happy]] seat of our
understanding would be that where it kept itself temperate, upright, and
inflexible, without tottering, or without agitation: _inter visa, vera
aut falsa, ad animi assensum, nihil interest:_ “amongst things that
seem, whether true or false, it signifies nothing to the assent of the
mind.” that things do not lodge in us in their form and essence, and
do not there make their entry by their own [[force]] and [[authority]], we
sufficiently see; because, if it were so, we should receive them after
the same manner; wine would have the same relish with the sick as with
the healthful; he who has his finger chapt or benumbed would find the
same hardness in wood or iron that he handles that another does; foreign
subjects then [[surrender]] themselves to our [[mercy]], and are seated in us as
we please. now if on our part we received any thing without alteration,
if [[human]] grasp were capable and [[strong]] enough to seize on [[truth]] by our
own means, these means being [[common]] to all [[men]], this [[truth]] would be
conveyed from hand to hand, from one to another; and at least there
would be some one thing to be found in the [[world]], amongst so many as
there are, that would be believed by [[men]] with an universal [[consent]];
but this, that there is no one proposition that is not debated and
controverted amongst us, or that may not be, makes it very manifest that
our [[natural]] [[judgment]] does not very clearly discern what it embraces; for
my [[judgment]] cannot make my companions approve of what it approves; which
is a sign that i seized it by some other means than by a [[natural]] power
that is in me and in all other [[men]].

let us lay aside this infinite confusion of opinions [[opinion]], which we see even
amongst the [[philosophers]] themselves, and this perpetual and universal
dispute about the [[knowledge]] of things; for this is truly presupposed,
that [[men]], i mean the most knowing, the [[best]] bom, and of the [[best]] parts,
are not agreed about any one thing, not that [[heaven]] is over our heads;
for they that [[doubt]] of every thing, do also [[doubt]] of that; and they
who deny that we are able to comprehend any thing, say that we have not
comprehended that the [[heaven]] is over our heads, and these two opinions
are, without comparison, the stronger in number.

besides this infinite [[diversity]] and division, through the trouble that
our [[judgment]] gives ourselves, and the incertainty that every one is
sensible of in himself, ‘tis easy to perceive that its seat is very
unstable and insecure. how variously do we [[judge]] of things?--how often
do we alter our opinions [[opinion]]? what i hold and [[believe]] to-day i hold and
believe with my whole [[belief]]; all my instruments and engines seize and
take hold of this [[opinion]], and become responsible to me for it, at least
as much as in them lies [[lie]]; i could not embrace nor conserve any truth
with greater confidence and assurance than i do this; i am wholly and
entirely possessed with it; but has it not befallen me, not only once,
but a hundred, a thousand times [[time]], every day, to have embraced some other
thing with all the same instruments, and in the same condition, which
i have since judged to be false? a [[man]] must at least become [[wise]] at his
own expense; if i have often found myself betrayed under this colour; if
my touch proves commonly false, and my balance unequal and [[unjust]], what
assurance can i now have more than at other times [[time]]? is it not stupidity
and madness to suffer myself to be so often deceived by my guide?
nevertheless, let [[fortune]] remove and shift us five hundred times [[time]] from
place to place, let her do nothing but incessantly empty and fill into
our [[belief]], as into a vessel, other and other opinions [[opinion]]; yet still the
present and the [[last]] is the [[certain]] and infallible one; for this we must
abandon goods [[good]], [[honour]], [[life]], health, and all.


      posterior.... res ilia reperta
   perdit, et immutat sensus ad pristina qnæqne.

      “the [[last]] things we find out are always [[best]],
   and make us to disrelish all the rest.”


whatever is preached to us, and whatever we learn, we should still
remember that it is [[man]] that gives and [[man]] that receives; ‘tis a mortal
hand that presents [[present]] it to us; ‘tis a mortal hand that accepts it the
things that come to us from [[heaven]] have the sole [[right]] and [[authority]] of
persuasion, the sole mark of [[truth]]; which also we do not see with our
own [[eyes]], nor receive by our own means; that [[great]] and [[sacred]] image
could not abide in so wretched a habitation if [[god]] for this end did not
prepare it, if [[god]] did not by his particular and supernatural grace and
favour fortify and reform it. at least our frail and defective condition
ought to make us behave ourselves with more reservedness and moderation
in our innovations and changes [[change]]; we ought to [[remember]] that, whatever we
receive into the understanding, we often receive things that are false,
and that it is by the same instruments that so often give themselves the
lie and are so often deceived.

now it is no wonder they should so often contradict themselves, being
so easy to be turned and swayed by very [[light]] occurrences. it is certain
that our apprehensions, our [[judgment]], and the faculties of the [[soul]] in
general, suffer according to the movements and alterations of the [[body]],
which alterations are continual. are not our minds [[mind]] more sprightly, ouï
memories more prompt and quick, and our thoughts [[thought]] more lively, in health
than in sickness? do not joy and gayety make us receive subjects
that [[present]] themselves to our souls [[soul]] quite otherwise than [[care]] and
melancholy? do you [[believe]] that catullus’s verses, or those of sappho,
please an old doting miser as they do a vigorous, amorous [[young]] [[man]]?
cleomenes, the [[son]] of anexandridas, being sick, his [[friends]] reproached
him that he had humours [[humour]] and whimsies that were new and unaccustomed;
“i [[believe]] it,” said he; “neither am i the same [[man]] now as when i am in
health; being now another [[person]], my opinions [[opinion]] and fancies are also other
than they were before.” in our courts of [[justice]] this word is much in
use, which is spoken of criminals [[criminal]] when they find the judges [[judge]] in a good
humour, gentle, and mild, _gaudeat de bonâ fortunâ _; “let him rejoice
in his [[good]] [[fortune]];” for it is most [[certain]] that [[men’s]] judgments [[judgment]] are
sometimes more prone to condemnation, more sharp and severe, and at
others more facile, easy, and inclined to excuse; he that carries with
him from his house the [[pain]] of the gout, [[jealousy]], or theft by his [[man]],
having his whole [[soul]] possessed with anger, it is not to be doubted
but that his [[judgment]] will lean this way. that venerable senate of the
areopagites used to hear and determine by night, for [[fear]] lest the sight
of the parties might [[corrupt]] their [[justice]]. the very air itself, and the
serenity of [[heaven]], will cause some mutation in us, according to these
verses in cicero:--


      tales sunt hominnm mentes, quali pater ipse
   [[jupiter]] auctiferâ lustravit lampade terras.

      “men’s minds [[mind]] are influenc’d by th’ external air,
   dark or serene, as days are foul or [[fair]].”


‘tis not only fevers, debauches, and [[great]] accidents, that overthrow our
judgments,--the least things in the [[world]] will do it; and we are not to
doubt, though we may not be sensible of it, that if a continued fever
can overwhelm the [[soul]], a tertian will in some proportionate measure
alter it; if an apoplexy can stupefy and totally extinguish the sight of
our understanding, we are not to [[doubt]] but that a [[great]] cold will dazzle
it; and consequently there is hardly one [[single]] hour in a man’s whole
life wherein our [[judgment]] is in its due place and [[right]] condition, our
bodies being [[subject]] to so many continual mutations, and stuffed with so
many several sorts of springs, that i [[believe]] the physicians, that it is
hard but that there must be always some one or other out of order.

as to what remains, this malady does not very easily discover itself,
unless it be extreme and [[past]] remedy; forasmuch as [[reason]] goes always
lame, halting, and that too as well with falsehood as with [[truth]]; and
therefore ‘tis hard to discover her deviations and mistakes. i always
call that appearance of meditation which every one forges in himself
reason; this [[reason]], of the condition of which there may be a hundred
contrary ones about one and the same [[subject]], is an instrument of lead
and of wax, ductile, pliable, and accommodate to all sorts of biases,
and to all measures; so that nothing remains but the art [[arts]] and [[skill]] how
to turn and mould it. how uprightly soever a [[judge]] may mean, if he
does not look well to himself, which few [[care]] to do, his inclination to
friendship, to relationship, to [[beauty]] or [[revenge]], and not only things
of that weight, but even the fortuitous instinct that makes us favour
one thing more than another, and that, without reason’s permission, puts
the [[choice]] upon us in two [[equal]] subjects [[subject]], or some shadow of like
vanity, may insensibly insinuate into his [[judgment]] the recommendation or
disfavour of a cause, and make the balance dip.

i, that watch myself as narrowly as i can, and that have my eyes
continually bent upon myself, like one that has no [[great]] [[business]] to do
elsewhere,


      quis sub arcto rex gelidæ metuatur oræ,
   quid tyridatem terreat, unice securus,

      “i [[care]] not whom the northern clime reveres,
   or what’s the [[king]] that tyridates fears [[fear]],”


dare hardly tell the vanity and weakness i find in myself my foot is so
unstable and unsteady, i find myself so apt to totter and reel, and my
sight so disordered, that, fasting, i am quite another [[man]] than when
full; if health and a [[fair]] day smile upon me, i am a very affable,
good-natured [[man]]; if a corn trouble my toe, i am sullen, out of [[humour]],
and not to be seen. the same pace of a horse seems to me one while
hard, and another easy; and the same way one while shorter, and another
longer; and the same form one while more, another less agreeable: i am
one while for doing every thing, and another for doing nothing at all;
and what pleases me now would be a trouble to me at another [[time]]. i
have a thousand senseless and casual actions within myself; either i
am possessed by melancholy or swayed by choler; now by its own private
authority sadness predominates in me, and by and by, i am as merry as
a cricket. when i take a [[book]] in hand i have then discovered admirable
graces in such and such passages, and such as have struck my [[soul]]; let
me [[light]] upon them at another [[time]], i may turn and toss, tumble
and rattle the leaves to no [[purpose]]; ‘tis then to me an inform and
undiscovered mass. even in my own writings i do not always find the air
of my first fancy; i [[know]] not what i would have said, and am often put
to it to [[correct]] and pump for a new sense, because i have lost the first
that was [[better]]. i do nothing but go and come; my [[judgment]] does not
always advance--it floats and roams:--


      velut minuta magno
   deprensa navis in mari vesaniente vento.

      “like a small bark that’s tost upon the main.
   when winds tempestuous heave the liquid plain.”


very often, as i am apt to do, having for exercise taken to maintain an
opinion contrary to my own, my [[mind]], bending and applying itself that
way, does so engage me that way that i no more discern the [[reason]] of my
former [[belief]], and forsake it i am, as it were, misled by the side to
which i incline, be it what it will, and carried away by my own weight.
every one almost would say the same of himself, if he considered himself
as i do. preachers very well [[know]] that the emotions which steal upon
them in speaking animate them towards [[belief]]; and that in passion we
are more warm in the defence of our proposition, take ourselves a deeper
impression of it, and embrace it with greater vehemence and approbation
than we do in our colder and more temperate [[state]]. you only give your
counsel a simple brief of your cause; he returns you a dubious and
uncertain [[answer]], by which you find him indifferent which side he takes.
have you feed him well that he may relish it the [[better]], does he begin
to be really concerned, and do you find him interested and zealous in
your quarrel? his [[reason]] and learning will by degrees [[degree]] grow hot in your
cause; behold an apparent and undoubted [[truth]] presents [[present]] itself to his
understanding; he discovers a new [[light]] in your [[business]], and does in
good earnest [[believe]] and persuade himself that it is so. nay, i do not
know whether the ardour that springs from spite and obstinacy, against
the [[power]] and [[violence]] of the magistrate and danger, or the interest of
reputation, may not have made some [[men]], even at the stake, maintain the
opinion for which, at [[liberty]], and amongst [[friends]], they would not have
burned a finger. the shocks and jostles that the [[soul]] receives from the
body’s [[passions]] can do much in it, but its own can do a [[great]] deal more;
to which it is so subjected that perhaps it may be made [[good]] that it has
no other pace and motion but from the breath of those winds, without the
agitation of which it would be becalmed and without action, like a
ship in the middle of the sea, to which the winds hare denied
their assistance. and whoever should maintain this, siding with the
peripatetics, would do us no [[great]] [[wrong]], seeing it is very well known
that the [[greatest]] and most [[noble]] actions of the [[soul]] proceed from, and
stand in need of, this impulse of the [[passions]]. valour, they say,
cannot be [[perfect]] without the assistance of anger; _semper ajax fortis,
fortissimus tamen in furore;_ “ajax was always brave, but most when in
a fury:” neither do we encounter the wicked and the [[enemy]] vigorously
enough if we be not angry; nay, the advocate, it is said, is to inspire
the judges [[judge]] with indignation, to obtain [[justice]].

irregular desires [[desire]] moved themistocles, and demosthenes, and have pushed
on the [[philosophers]] to watching, fasting, and pilgrimages; and lead us
to [[honour]], learning, and health, which are all very useful ends. and
this meanness of [[soul]], in suffering [[anxiety]] and trouble, serves to breed
remorse and repentance in the [[conscience]], and to make us sensible of
the scourge of [[god]], and [[politic]] correction for the chastisement of
our offences; compassion is a spur to clemency; and the prudence of
preserving and governing ourselves is roused by our [[fear]]; and how many
brave actions by ambition! how many by presumption! in short, there is
no brave and [[spiritual]] [[virtue]] without some irregular agitation. may not
this be one of the reasons [[reason]] that moved the epicureans to discharge god
from all [[care]] and solicitude of our affairs; because even the effects of
his goodness could not be exercised in our behalf without disturbing its
repose, by the means of [[passions]] which are so many spurs and instruments
pricking on the [[soul]] to [[virtuous]] actions; or have they thought
otherwise, and taken them for tempests, that shamefully hurry the soul
from her tranquillity? _ut maris tranquillitas intettigitur, nullâ, ne
minima quidem, aura fluctus commovente: sic animi quietus et placatus
status cemitur, quum perturbatis nulla est, qua moveri queat.._ “as it
is understood to be a calm sea when there is not the least breath of air
stirring; so the [[state]] of the [[soul]] is discerned to be quiet and appeased
when there is no perturbation to move it.”

what varieties of sense and [[reason]], what contrariety of imaginations
does the [[diversity]] of our [[passions]] inspire us with! what assurance then
can we take of a thing so mobile and unstable, [[subject]] by its condition
to the dominion of trouble, and never going other than a forced and
borrowed pace? if our [[judgment]] be in the [[power]] even of sickness and
perturbation; if it be from folly and rashness that it is to receive the
impression of things, what security can we expect from it?

is it not a [[great]] boldness in [[philosophy]] to [[believe]] that [[men]] perform the
greatest actions, and nearest approaching the divinity, when they
are furious, mad, and beside themselves? we [[better]] ourselves by the
privation of our [[reason]], and drilling it. the two [[natural]] ways to
enter into the cabinet of the gods, and there to foresee the course of
destiny, are fury and sleep.

this is pleasant to consider; by the dislocation that [[passions]] cause
in our [[reason]], we become [[virtuous]]; by its extirpation, occasioned by
madness or the image of [[death]], we become diviners and prophets [[prophet]]. i was
never so willing to [[believe]] [[philosophy]] in any thing as this. ‘tis a pure
enthusiasm wherewith [[sacred]] [[truth]] has inspired the spirit of [[philosophy]],
which makes it confess, contrary to its own proposition, that the most
calm, composed, and healthful estate ef the [[soul]] that [[philosophy]] can
seat it in is not its [[best]] condition; our waking is more a sleep than
sleep itself, our [[wisdom]] less [[wise]] than folly; our dreams [[dream]] are worth more
than our meditation; and the worst place we can take is in ourselves.
but does not [[philosophy]] [[think]] that we are [[wise]] enough to consider
that the voice that the spirit utters, when dismissed from [[man]], so
clear-sighted, so [[great]], and so [[perfect]], and whilst it is in [[man]] so
terrestrial, ignorant, and dark, is a voice proceeding from the spirit
of dark, terrestrial, and ignorant [[man]], and for this [[reason]] a voice not
to be trusted and believed?

i, being of a soft and heavy [[complexion]], have no [[great]] [[experience]] of
these vehement agitations, the most of which surprise the [[soul]] on a
sudden, without giving it leisure to recollect itself. but the passion
that is said to be produced by idleness in the hearts [[heart]] of [[young]] [[men]],
though it proceed leisurely, and with a measured [[progress]], does
evidently manifest, to those who have tried to oppose its [[power]], the
violence our [[judgment]] suffers in this alteration and conversion. i have
formerly attempted to withstand and repel it; for i am so far from being
one of those that invite vices [[vice]], that i do not so much as [[follow]] them, if
they do not haul me along; i perceived it to spring, grow, and increase,
in spite of my [[resistance]]; and at [[last]], living and seeing as i was,
wholly to seize and possess me. so that, as if rousing from drunkenness,
the images of things began to appear to me quite other than they used
to be; i evidently saw the advantages of the object i [[desired]], grow,
and increase, and expand by the influence of my [[imagination]], and the
difficulties of my attempt to grow more easy and smooth; and both my
reason and [[conscience]] to be laid aside; but this [[fire]] being evaporated
in an instant, as from a flash of lightning, i was aware that my soul
resumed another [[kind]] of sight, another [[state]], and another [[judgment]];
the difficulties of retreat appeared [[great]] and invincible, and the same
things had quite another taste and aspect than the heat of [[desire]] had
presented them to me; which of the two most truly? pyrrho knows [[know]] nothing
about it. we are never without sickness. agues have their hot and cold
fits; from the effects of an ardent passion we fall again to shivering;
as much as i had advanced, so much i retired:--


      qualis ubi alterno procurrens gurgite pontus,
   nunc ruit ad terras, scopulosque superjacit undam
   spumeus, extremamque sinu perfundit arenam;
   nunc rapidus retro, atque æstu revoluta resorbens
   saxa, fugit, littusque vado labente relihquit.

      “so swelling surges, with a thundering roar,
   driv’n on each others’ backs, insult the shore,
   bound o’er the rocks, encroach upon the [[land]],
   and far upon the beach heave up the sand;
   then backward rapidly they take their way,
   repulsed from upper ground, and seek the sea.”


now, from the [[knowledge]] of this volubility of mine, i have accidentally
begot in myself a [[certain]] constancy of opinions [[opinion]], and have not much
altered those that were first and [[natural]] in me; for what appearance
soever there may be in novelty, i do not easily [[change]], for [[fear]] of
losing by the bargain; and, as i am not capable of choosing, i take
other [[men’s]] [[choice]], and keep myself in the station wherein [[god]] has
placed me; i could not otherwise keep myself from perpetual rolling.
thus have i, by the grace of [[god]], preserved myself entire, without
anxiety or trouble of [[conscience]], in the ancient [[faith]] of our [[religion]],
amidst so many sects and divisions as our [[age]] has produced. the writings
of the ancients, the [[best]] authors i mean, being full and solid, tempt
and carry me which way almost they will; he that i am reading seems
always to have the most [[force]]; and i find that every one in his turn is
in the [[right]], though they contradict one another. the facility that good
wits have of rendering every thing likely they would recommend, and
that nothing is so [[strange]] to which they do not undertake to give colour
enough to [[deceive]] such simplicity as mine, this evidently shows the
weakness of their testimony. the heavens [[heaven]] and the stars have been
three thousand years in motion; all the [[world]] were of that belief
till cleanthes the samian, or, according to theophrastus, nicetas of
syracuse, took it into his head to maintain that it was the [[earth]] that
moved, turning about its axis by the oblique circle of the zodiac.
and copernicus has in our times [[time]] so grounded this doctrine that it very
regularly serves to all astrological consequences; what use can we
make of this, if not that we ought not much to [[care]] which is the true
opinion? and who knows [[know]] but that a third, a thousand years hence, may
over throw the two former.


      sic volvenda ætas commutât tempora rerum:
   quod fuit in pretio, fit nullo denique honore;
   porro aliud succedit, et e contemptibus exit,
   inque dies magis appetitur, floretque repertum
   laudibus, et miro est mortales inter honore.

      “thus ev’ry thing is changed in course of [[time]],
   what now is valued passes soon its prime;
   to which some other thing, despised before,
   succeeds, and grows in vogue still more and more;
   and once received, too faint all praises [[praise]] seem,
   so highly it is rais’d in [[men’s]] esteem.”


so that when any new doctrine presents [[present]] itself to us, we have great
reason to mistrust, and to consider that, before that was set on foot,
the contrary had been generally received; and that, as that has been
overthrown by this, a third invention, in [[time]] to come, may start
up which may damn the second. before the principles [[principle]] that aristotle
introduced were in [[reputation]], other principles [[principle]] contented [[human]] [[reason]],
as these satisfy us now. what patent have these [[people]], what particular
privilege, that the [[career]] of our invention must be stopped by them, and
that the possession of our whole future [[belief]] should belong to them?
they are no more exempt from being thrust out of doors than their
predecessors were. when any one presses me with a new argument, i ought
to [[believe]] that what i cannot [[answer]] another can; for to [[believe]] all
likelihoods that a [[man]] cannot confute is [[great]] simplicity; it would
by that means come to pass that all the vulgar (and we are all of the
vulgar) would have their [[belief]] as tumable as a weathercock; for their
souls, being so easy to be imposed upon, and without any [[resistance]],
must of [[force]] incessantly receive other and other impressions, the last
still effacing all footsteps of that which went before. he that finds
himself [[weak]] ought to [[answer]], according to practice, that he will speak
with his counsel, or refer himself to the wiser, from whom he received
his instruction. how long is it that physic has been practised in the
world? ‘tis said that a new comer, called paracelsus, changes [[change]] and
overthrows the whole order of ancient rules [[rule]], and maintains that, till
now, it has been of no other use but to kill [[men]]. i [[believe]] he will
easily make this [[good]], but i do not [[think]] it were [[wisdom]] to venture my
life in making [[trial]] of his own [[experience]]. we are not to [[believe]] every
one, says the precept, because every one can say all things. a [[man]] of
this profession of novelties and physical reformations not long since
told me that all the ancients were notoriously mistaken in the nature
and motions of the winds, which he would evidently demonstrate to me if
i would give him the hearing. after i had with some patience heard his
arguments, which were all full of likelihood of [[truth]]: “what, then,”
 said i, “did those that sailed according to theophrastus make way
westward, when they had the prow towards the east? did they go sideward
or backward?” “that’s [[fortune]],” answered he, “but so it is that they
were mistaken.” i replied that i had rather [[follow]] effects than [[reason]].
now these are things that often interfere with one another, and i have
been told that in geometry (which pretends to have gained the highest
point of certainty of all science) there are inevitable demonstrations
found which subvert the [[truth]] of all [[experience]]; as jacques pelletier
told me, at my own house, that he had found out two lines stretching
themselves one towards the other to meet, which nevertheless he
affirmed, though extended to infinity, could never arrive to touch one
another. and the pyrrhonians make no other use of their arguments and
their [[reason]] than to ruin the appearance of [[experience]]; and ‘tis a
wonder how far the suppleness of our [[reason]] has followed them in this
design of controverting the evidence of effects; for they affirm that we
do not move, that we do not speak, and that there is neither weight nor
heat, with the same [[force]] of argument that we affirm the most likely
things. ptolemy, who was a [[great]] [[man]], had established the bounds of this
world of ours; all the ancient [[philosophers]] [[thought]] they had the measure
of it, excepting some remote isles that might escape their [[knowledge]];
it had been pyrrhonism, a thousand years ago, to [[doubt]] the [[science]] of
cosmography, and the opinions [[opinion]] that every one had received from it; it
was heresy to admit the antipodes; and behold, in this [[age]] of ours,
there is an infinite extent of terra firma discovered, not an island or
single [[country]], but a division of the [[world]], nearly [[equal]] in greatness
to that we knew before. the geographers of our [[time]] stick not to assure
us that now all is found; all is seen:--


   nam quod adest prosto, placet, et pollere videtur;

   “what’s [[present]] pleases, and appears the [[best]];”


but it remains to be seen whether, as ptolemy was therein formerly
deceived upon the foundation of his [[reason]], it were not very foolish to
trust now in what these [[people]] say? and whether it is not more likely
that this [[great]] [[body]], which we call the [[world]], is not quite another
thing than what we imagine.

plato says that it changes [[change]] countenance in all respects [[respect]]; that the
heavens, the stars, and the sun, have all of them sometimes motions
retrograde to what we see, changing east into west the egyptian priests
told herodotus that from the [[time]] of their first [[king]], which was eleven
thousand and odd years since (and they showed him the effigies of all
their kings [[king]] in statues taken from the life), the sun had four times
altered his course; that the sea and the [[earth]] did alternately change
into one another; that the beginning of the [[world]] is undetermined;
aristotle and cicero both say the same; and some amongst us are of
opinion that it has been from all eternity, is mortal, and renewed again
by several vicissitudes; calling solomon and isaiah to witness; to evade
those oppositions, that [[god]] has once been a creator without a creature;
that he has had nothing to do, that he got rid of that idleness by
putting his hand to this [[work]]; and that consequently he is [[subject]] to
change. in the most famous of the [[greek]] schools the [[world]] is taken for a
god, made by another [[god]] greater than he, and composed of a [[body]], and a
soul fixed in his centre, and dilating himself by musical numbers to
his circumference; [[divine]], infinitely [[happy]], and infinitely [[great]],
infinitely [[wise]] and eternal; in him are other gods, the sea, the [[earth]],
the stars, who entertain one another with an harmonious and perpetual
agitation and [[divine]] dance, sometimes meeting, sometimes retiring from
one another; concealing and discovering themselves; changing their
order, one while before, and another behind. heraclitus was positive
that the [[world]] was composed of [[fire]]; and, by the order of [[destiny]],
was one day to be enflamed and consumed in [[fire]], and then to be again
renewed. and apuleius says of [[men]]: _sigillatim mortales, cunctim
perpetui._ “that they are mortal in particular, and [[immortal]] in
general.” alexander writ to his [[mother]] the narration of an egyptian
priest, drawn from their monuments, testifying the antiquity of that
nation to be infinite, and comprising the birth and [[progress]] of other
countries. cicero and diodorus say that in their [[time]] the chaldees kept
a register of four hundred thousand and odd years, [[aristotle]], pliny,
and others, that zoroaster flourished six thousand years before plato’s
time. [[plato]] says that they of the [[city]] of sais have records in writing
of eight thousand years; and that the [[city]] of [[athens]] was built a
thousand years before the said [[city]] of sais; epicurus, that at the same
time things are here in the posture we see, they are alike and in the
same manner in several other worlds [[world]]; which he would have delivered with
greater assurance, had he seen the similitude and concordance of the new
discovered [[world]] of the west indies with ours, [[present]] and [[past]], in so
many [[strange]] examples [[example]].

in earnest, considering what is come to our [[knowledge]] from the course
of this terrestrial polity, i have often wondered to see in so vast a
distance of places and times [[time]] such a concurrence of so [[great]] a number of
popular and wild opinions [[opinion]], and of savage manners and beliefs, which by
no means seem to proceed from our [[natural]] meditation. the [[human]] [[mind]] is
a [[great]] worker of miracles! but this relation has, moreover, i know
not what of extraordinary in it; ‘tis found to be in names, also, and a
thousand other things; for they found nations there (that, for aught we
know, never heard of us) where circumcision was in use; where there were
states and [[great]] civil governments [[government]] maintained by [[women]] only, without
men; where our fasts and lent were represented, to which was added
abstinence from [[women]]; where our crosses were several ways in repute;
here they were made use of to [[honour]] and adorn their sepultures, there
they were erected, and particularly that of st andrew, to protect
themselves from nocturnal visions, and to lay upon the cradles of
infants against enchantments; elsewhere there was found one of wood,
of very [[great]] height, which was adored for the [[god]] of rain, and this
a [[great]] way in the interior; there was seen an express image of our
penance priests [[priest]], the use of mitres, the celibacy of priests [[priest]], the art
of divination by the entrails of sacrificed beasts, abstinence from all
sorts of flesh and fish in their diet, the manner of priests [[priest]] officiating
in a particular and not a vulgar [[language]]; and this fancy, that the
first [[god]] was driven away by a second, his younger [[brother]]; that they
were created with all sorts of necessaries and conveniences, which have
since been in a [[degree]] taken from them for their sins [[sin]], their territory
changed, and their [[natural]] condition made worse; that they were of
old overwhelmed by the inundation of water from [[heaven]]; that but few
families escaped, who retired into caves on high mountains, the mouths
of which they stopped so that the waters could not get in, having shut
up, together with themselves, several sorts of animals; that when they
perceived the rain to cease they sent out dogs, which returning clean
and wet, they judged that the water was not much abated; afterwards
sending out others, and seeing them return dirty, they issued out to
repeople the [[world]], which they found only full of serpents. in one place
we met with the [[belief]] of a day of [[judgment]]; insomuch that they were
marvellously displeased at the spaniards for discomposing the bones of
the [[dead]], in rifling the sepultures for riches [[rich]], saying that those bones
so disordered could not easily rejoin; the traffic by exchange, and no
other way; fairs and markets for that end; dwarfs and deformed people
for the ornament of the tables of princes [[prince]]; the use of falconry,
according to the [[nature]] of their hawks; [[tyrannical]] subsidies; nicety in
gardens; dancing, tumbling tricks, [[music]] of instruments, coats of arms,
tennis-courts, dice and lotteries, wherein they are sometimes so eager
and hot as to stake themselves and their [[liberty]]; physic, no otherwise
than by charms; the way of writing in cypher; the [[belief]] of only one
first [[man]], the [[father]] of all nations; the adoration of one [[god]], who
formerly lived a [[man]] in [[perfect]] virginity, fasting, and penitence,
preaching the laws [[law]] of [[nature]], and the ceremonies [[ceremony]] of [[religion]], and that
vanished from the [[world]] without a [[natural]] [[death]]; the theory of giants;
the custom of making themselves drunk with their beverages, and drinking
to the utmost; [[religious]] ornaments painted with bones and [[dead]] men’s
skulls; surplices, holy water sprinkled; wives [[wife]] and servants, who present
themselves with emulation, burnt and interred with the [[dead]] husband or
master; a [[law]] by which the eldest succeeds to all the estate, no
part being left for the younger but [[obedience]]; the custom that, upon
promotion to a [[certain]] office of [[great]] [[authority]], the promoted is to
take upon him a new name, and to leave that which he had before; another
to strew lime upon the knee of the new-born child, with these words:

“from dust thou earnest, and to dust thou must return;” as also the art
of augury. the [[vain]] shadows of our [[religion]], which are observable in
some of these examples [[example]], are testimonies of its [[dignity]] and divinity. it
is not only in some sort insinuated into all the infidel nations on this
side of the [[world]], by a [[certain]] imitation, but in these barbarians
also, as by a [[common]] and supernatural inspiration; for we find there the
belief of [[purgatory]], but of a new form; that which we give to the fire
they give to the cold, and imagine that souls [[soul]] are purged and punished by
the rigour of an excessive coldness. and this [[example]] puts me in mind
of another pleasant [[diversity]]; for as there were there some [[people]] who
delighted to unmuffle the ends of their instruments, and clipped off
the prepuce after the mahometan and jewish manner; there were others who
made so [[great]] [[conscience]] of laying it bare, that they carefully pursed
it up with little strings to keep that end from peeping into the air;
and of this other [[diversity]], that whereas we, to [[honour]] kings [[king]] and
festivals, put on the [[best]] clothes we have; in some regions, to express
their disparity and submission to their [[king]], his subjects [[subject]] present
themselves before him in their vilest habits, and entering his palace,
throw some old tattered garment over their [[better]] apparel, to the end
that all the lustre and ornament may solely be in him. but to proceed:--

if [[nature]] enclose within the bounds of her ordinary [[progress]] the
beliefs, judgments [[judgment]], and opinions [[opinion]] of [[men]], as well as all other things;
if they have their [[revolution]], their season, their birth and [[death]], like
cabbage plants; if the heavens [[heaven]] agitate and [[rule]] them at their [[pleasure]],
what magisterial and permanent [[authority]] do we attribute to them? if
we experimentally see that the form of our beings depends upon the air,
upon the [[climate]], and upon the soil, where we are bom, and not only the
colour, the stature, the [[complexion]], and the countenances, but moreover
the very faculties of the [[soul]] itself: et plaga codi non solum ad robor
corporum, sed etiam anirum facit: “the [[climate]] is of [[great]] efficacy,
not only to the [[strength]] of bodies [[body]], but to that of souls [[soul]] also,” says
vegetius; and that the [[goddess]] who founded the [[city]] of [[athens]] chose
to situate it in a temperature of air fit to make [[men]] prudent, as
the egyptian priests [[priest]] told solon: _athenis tenue colum; ex quo etiam
acutiores putantur attici; crassum thebis; itaque pingues thebani,
et valentes:_ “the air of [[athens]] is subtle and thin; whence also the
athenians are reputed to be more acute; and at thebes more gross and
thick; wherefore the thebans are looked upon as more heavy-witted and
more [[strong]].” in such sort that, as fruits and animals grow different,
men are also more or less warlike, just, temperate, and docile; here
given to wine, elsewhere to theft or uncleanness; here inclined to
superstition, elsewhere to unbelief; in one place to [[liberty]], in another
to servitude; capable of one [[science]] or of one art [[arts]], dull or ingenious,
obedient or mutinous, [[good]] or [[bad]], according as the place where they
are seated inclines them; and assume a new [[complexion]], if removed, like
trees, which was the [[reason]] why cyrus would not grant the persians
leave to quit their rough and craggy [[country]] to remove to another
more pleasant and even, saying, that fertile and tender soils made
men effeminate and soft. if we see one while one art [[arts]] and one belief
flourish, and another while another, through some celestial influence;
such an [[age]] to [[produce]] such natures [[nature]], and to incline [[mankind]] to such and
such a propension, the spirits of [[men]] one while [[gay]] and another gray,
like our fields, what becomes of all those fine prerogatives we so
soothe ourselves withal? seeing that a [[wise]] [[man]] may be mistaken, and a
hundred [[men]] and a hundred nations, nay, that even [[human]] nature
itself, as we [[believe]], is many ages [[age]] wide in one thing or another, what
assurances have we that she should cease to be mistaken, or that in this
very [[age]] of ours she is not so?

methinks that amongst other testimonies of our imbecility, this ought
not to be forgotten, that [[man]] cannot, by his own [[wish]] and [[desire]], find
out what he wants; that not in fruition only, but in [[imagination]] and
wish, we cannot agree about what we would have to satisfy and content
us. let us leave it to our own [[thought]] to cut out and make up at
pleasure; it cannot so much as covet what is proper for it, and satisfy
itself:--


      quid enim ratione timemus,
   aut cupimus? quid tain dextro pede concipis, ut te
   conatus non poniteat, votique peracti?

      “for what, with [[reason]], do we speak or shun,
   what plan, how happily soe’r begun,
   that, when achieved, we do not [[wish]] undone?”


and therefore it was that [[socrates]] only begged of the gods that they
would give him what they knew to be [[best]] for him; and the private
and [[public]] prayer of the lacedemonians was simply for [[good]] and useful
things, referring the [[choice]] and election of them to the discretion of
the supreme [[power]]:--


      conjugium petimus, partumqué uxoris; at illis
   notum, qui pueri, qualisque futura sit uxor:

      “we ask for wives [[wife]] and [[children]]; they above
   [[know]] only, when we have them, what they’ll prove;”


and christians [[christian]] [[pray]] to [[god]], “thy will be done,” that they may not fall
into the inconvenience the poet feigns of [[king]] midas. he prayed to
the gods that all he touched might be turned into gold; his prayer was
heard; his wine was gold, his bread was gold, the feathers of his
bed, his shirt, his clothes, were all gold, so that he found himself
overwhelmed with the fruition of his [[desire]], and endowed with an
intolerable benefit, and was fain to unpray his prayers.


      attonitus novitate mali, divesque, miserque,
   effugere optât opes, et, quæ modo voverat, odit.

      “astonished at the strangeness of the ill,
   to be so [[rich]], yet miserable still;
   he wishes [[wish]] now he could his [[wealth]] evade,
   and hates the thing for which before he prayed.”


to instance in myself: being [[young]], i [[desired]] of [[fortune]], above all
things, the order of st. michael, which was then the utmost distinction
of [[honour]] amongst the french nobles [[noble]], and very rare. she pleasantly
gratified my longing; instead of raising me, and lifting me up from my
own place to attain to it, she was much kinder to me; for she brought it
so low, and made it so cheap, that it stooped down to my shoulders, and
lower. cleobis and bito, trophonius and agamedes, having requested, the
first of their [[goddess]], the [[last]] of their [[god]], a recompense worthy of
their piety, had [[death]] for a [[reward]]; so differing from ours are heavenly
opinions concerning what is fit for us. [[god]] might grant us riches [[rich]],
honours, [[life]], and even health, to our own hurt; for every thing that
is pleasing to us is not always [[good]] for us. if he sends us [[death]], or
an increase of sickness, instead of a cure, _vvrga tua et baculus, tuus
ipsa me consolata sunt._ “thy rod and thy staff have comforted me,” he
does it by the [[rule]] of his providence, which [[better]] and more certainly
discerns what is proper for us than we can do; and we ought to take it
in [[good]] part, as coming from a [[wise]] and most friendly hand


      si consilium vis:
   permittee ipsis expendere numinibus, quid
   conveniat nobis, rebusque sit utile nostris...
   carior est illis homo quam sibi;

      “if thou’lt be rul’d, to th’ gods thy fortunes [[fortune]] trust,
   their thoughts [[thought]] are [[wise]], their dispensations just.
   what [[best]] may [[profit]] or delight they [[know]],
   and real [[good]], for fancied bliss, bestow;
   with [[eyes]] of [[pity]], they our frailties scan,
   more dear to them, than to himself, is [[man]];”


for to require of him honours [[honour]] and commands, is to require ‘that he may
throw you into a [[battle]], set you upon a cast at dice, or something of
the like [[nature]], whereof the issue is to you unknown, and the fruit
doubtful.

there is no dispute so sharp and [[violent]] amongst the [[philosophers]],
as about the [[question]] of the [[sovereign]] [[good]] of [[man]]; whence, by the
calculation of varro, rose two hundred and eighty-eight sects. _qui
autem de summo bono dissentit, de totâ philosophies ratione disputât._
“for whoever enters into controversy concerning the supreme [[good]],
disputes upon the whole matter of [[philosophy]].”


      très mihi convivæ prope dissentire videntur,
   poscentes vario mul turn divers a palato;
   quid dem? quid non dem? renuis tu quod jubet alter;
   quod petis, id sane est invisum acidumque duobus;

      “i have three guests invited to a feast,
   and all appear to have a different taste;
   what shall i give them? what shall i refuse?
   what one dislikes the other two shall choose;
   and e’en the very dish you like the best
   is acid or insipid to the rest:”


nature should say the same to their contests and debates. some say that
our well-being lies [[lie]] in [[virtue]], others in [[pleasure]], others in submitting
to [[nature]]; one in [[knowledge]], another in being exempt from [[pain]], another
in not suffering ourselves to be carried away by appearances; and this
fancy seems to have some relation to that of the ancient pythagoras,


      nil admirari, prope res est una, numici,
   solaque, quæ possit facere et servare beatum:

      “not to admire’s the only art [[arts]] i know
   can make us [[happy]], and can keep us so;”


which is the drift of the pyrrhonian sect; [[aristotle]] attributes the
admiring nothing to magnanimity; and arcesilaus said, that constancy and
a [[right]] inflexible [[state]] of [[judgment]] were the true [[good]], and consent
and application the [[sin]] and [[evil]]; and there, it is true, in being thus
positive, and establishing a [[certain]] axiom, he quitted pyrrhonism; for
the’ pyrrhonians, when they say that ataraxy, which is the immobility
of [[judgment]], is the [[sovereign]] [[good]], do not design to speak it
affirmatively; but that the same motion of [[soul]] which makes them avoid
precipices, and take shelter from the cold, presents [[present]] them such a fancy,
and makes them refuse another.

how much do i [[wish]] that, whilst i [[live]], either some other or justus
lipsius, the most learned [[man]] now living, of a most polite and judicious
understanding, truly resembling my turnebus, had both the will and
health, and leisure sufficient, carefully and conscientiously to collect
into a register, according to their divisions and classes, as many as
are to be found, of the opinions [[opinion]] of the ancient [[philosophers]], about the
subject of our being and manners, their controversies, the succession
and [[reputation]] of sects; with the application of the lives [[life]] of the
authors and their disciples to their own precepts, in memorable
accidents, and upon exemplary occasions [[occasion]]. what a beautiful and useful
work that would be!

as to what remains, if it be from ourselves that we are to extract the
rules of our manners, upon what a confusion do we throw ourselves! for
that which our [[reason]] advises us to, as the most likely, is generally
for every one to obey the laws [[law]] of his [[country]], as was the [[advice]] of
socrates, inspired, as he says, by a [[divine]] counsel; and by that,
what would it say, but that our [[duty]] has no other [[rule]] but what is
accidental? [[truth]] ought to have a like and universal visage; if man
could [[know]] equity and [[justice]] that had a [[body]] and a true being, he would
not fetter it to the conditions of this [[country]] or that; it would not be
from the whimsies of the persians or indians [[indian]] that [[virtue]] would receive
its form. there is nothing more [[subject]] to perpetual agitation than
the laws [[law]]; since i was born, i have known those of the english, our
neighbours, three or four times [[time]] changed, not only in matters of civil
regimen, which is the only thing wherein constancy may be dispensed
with, but in the most important [[subject]] that can be, namely, [[religion]],
at which i am the more troubled and ashamed, because it is a nation with
whom those of my province have formerly had so [[great]] familiarity and
acquaintance, that there yet remains in my house some footsteps of our
ancient kindred; and here with us at [[home]], i have known a thing that
was [[capital]] to become lawful; and we that hold of others are likewise,
according to the [[chance]] of [[war]], in a possibility of being one day found
guilty of high-treason, both [[divine]] and [[human]], should the [[justice]] of
our arms fall into the [[power]] of [[injustice]], and, after a few years’
possession, take a quite contrary being. how could that ancient [[god]] more
clearly accuse the ignorance of [[human]] [[knowledge]] concerning the divine
being, and give [[men]] to [[understand]] that their [[religion]] was but a thing of
their own contrivance, useful as a bond to their [[society]], than declaring
as he did to those who came to his tripod for instruction, that every
one’s true [[worship]] was that which he found in use in the place where he
chanced to be? o [[god]], what infinite obligation have we to the bounty
of our [[sovereign]] creator, for having disabused our [[belief]] from these
wandering and arbitrary devotions, and for having seated it upon the
eternal foundation of his holy word? but what then will [[philosophers]] say
to us in this necessity? “that we [[follow]] the laws [[law]] of our [[country]];” that
is to say, this floating sea of the opinions [[opinion]] of a [[republic]], or a [[prince]],
that will paint out [[justice]] for me in as many colours, and form it
as many ways as there are changes [[change]] of [[passions]] in themselves; i cannot
suffer my [[judgment]] to be so flexible. what [[kind]] of [[virtue]] is that which
i see one day in repute, and that to-morrow shall be in none, and which
the crossing of a river makes a crime? what sort of [[truth]] can that
be, which these mountains limit to us, and make a [[lie]] to all the world
beyond them?

but they are pleasant, when, to give some certainty to the laws [[law]], they
say, that there are some firm, perpetual, and immovable, which they call
natural, that are imprinted in [[human]] [[kind]] by the condition of their own
proper being; and of these some reckon three, some four, some more, some
less; a sign that it is a mark as doubtful as the rest now they are so
unfortunate, (for what can i call it else but misfortune that, of so
infinite a number of laws [[law]], there should not be found one at least
that [[fortune]] and the temerity of [[chance]] has [[suffered]] to be universally
received by the [[consent]] of all nations?) they are, i say, so miserable,
that of these three or four select laws [[law]], there is not so much as one
that is not contradicted and disowned, not only by one nation, but by
many. now, the only likely sign, by which they can argue or infer some
natural laws [[law]], is the universality of approbation; for we should, without
doubt, [[follow]] with a [[common]] [[consent]] that which [[nature]] had truly ordained
us; and not only every nation, but every private [[man]], would resent the
force and [[violence]] that any one should do him who would tempt him to
any thing contrary to this [[law]]. but let them [[produce]] me one of this
condition. proctagoras and aristo gave no other essence to the justice
of laws [[law]] than the [[authority]] and [[opinion]] of the legislator; and that,
these laid aside, the honest and the [[good]] lost their qualities, and
remained empty names of indifferent things; thrasymachus, in [[plato]],
is of [[opinion]] that there is no other [[right]] but the convenience of the
superior. there is not any thing wherein the [[world]] is so various as in
laws and customs; such a thing is abominable here which is elsewhere in
esteem, as in lacedemon dexterity in stealing; marriages [[marriage]] between near
relations, are capitally interdicted amongst us; they are elsewhere in
honour:--


      gentes esse ferantur,
   in quibus et nato genitrix, et nata parenti
   jungitur, et pietas geminato crescit amore;

      “there are some nations in the [[world]], ‘tis said,
   where fathers [[father]] daughters [[daughter]], sons [[son]] their mothers [[mother]] wed;
   and their affections thereby higher rise,
   more firm and constant by these double ties;”


the murder of infants, the murder of fathers [[father]], the [[community]] of wives [[wife]],
traffic of robberies, license in all sorts of voluptuousness; in short,
there is nothing so extreme that is not allowed by the custom of some
nation or other.

it is credible that there are [[natural]] laws [[law]] for us, as we see them
in other creatures; but they are lost in us, this fine [[human]] reason
everywhere so insinuating itself to govern and command, as to shuffle
and confound the face of things, according to its own vanity and
inconstancy: _nihil itaque amplius nostrum est; quod nostrum dico,
artis est:_ “therefore nothing is any more truly ours; what we call ours
belongs to art [[arts]].” subjects [[subject]] have divers lustres and divers considerations,
and thence the [[diversity]] of opinions [[opinion]] principally proceeds; one nation
considers a [[subject]] in one aspect, and stops there: another takes it in
a different point of view.

there is nothing of greater [[horror]] to be imagined than for a [[man]] to eat
his [[father]]; and yet the [[people]], whose ancient custom it was so to do,
looked upon it as a testimony of piety and affection, seeking thereby to
give their progenitors the most worthy and honourable sepulture; storing
up in themselves, and as it were in their own marrow, the bodies
and relics of their fathers [[father]]; and in some sort regenerating them by
transmutation into their living flesh, by means of nourishment and
digestion. it is easy to consider what a [[cruelty]] and abomination it
must have appeared to [[men]] possessed and imbued with this snperstition
to throw their fathers’ remains to the [[corruption]] of the [[earth]], and the
nourishment of beasts and worms.

lycurgus considered in theft the vivacity, diligence, boldness, and
dexterity of purloining any thing from our neighbours, and the benefit
that redounded to the [[public]] that every one should look more narrowly
to the conservation of what was his own; and believed that, from this
double institution of assaulting and defending, advantage was to be made
for [[military]] discipline (which was the principal [[science]] and [[virtue]] to
which he would inure that nation), of greater consideration than the
disorder and [[injustice]] of taking another man’s goods [[good]].

dionysius, the [[tyrant]], offered [[plato]] a robe of the persian [[fashion]],
long, damasked, and perfumed; [[plato]] refused it, saying, “that being
born a [[man]], he would not willingly dress himself in women’s clothes;”
 but aristippus accepted it with this [[answer]], “that no accoutrement could
corrupt a chaste [[courage]].” his [[friends]] reproaching him with meanness of
spirit, for laying it no more to [[heart]] that dionysius had spit in his
face, “fishermen,” said he, “suffer themselves to be drenched with the
waves of the sea from head to foot to catch a gudgeon.” diogenes was
washing cabbages, and seeing him pass by, “if thou couldst [[live]] on
cabbage,” said he, “thou wouldst not fawn upon a [[tyrant]];” to whom
aristippus replied, “and if thou knewest how to [[live]] amongst [[men]], thou
wouldst not be washing cabbages.” thus [[reason]] finds appearances for
divers effects; ‘tis a pot with two ears that a [[man]] may take by the
right or left:--


      bellum, o terra hospita, portas:
   bello armantur eqni; bellum hæc armenta minantur.
   sed tamen idem olim curru succedere sueti
   quadrupedes, et frena jugo concordia ferre;
   spes est pacis.

      “war, [[war]] is threatened from this [[foreign]] ground
   (my [[father]] cried), where warlike steeds are found.
   yet, since reclaimed, to chariots they submit,
   and bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,
   [[peace]] may succeed to [[war]].”


solon, being lectured by his [[friends]] not to shed powerless and
unprofitable tears for the [[death]] of his [[son]], “it is for that [[reason]] that
i the more justly shed them,” said he, “because they are powerless
and unprofitable.” socrates’s [[wife]] exasperated her [[grief]] by this
circumstance: “oh, how unjustly do these wicked judges [[judge]] put him to
death!” “why,” replied he, “hadst thou rather they should execute me
justly?” we have our ears bored; the greeks [[greek]] looked upon that as a mark
of [[slavery]]. we retire in private to enjoy our wives [[wife]]; the indians [[indian]] do it
in [[public]]. the scythians immolated strangers in their temples; elsewhere
temples were a refuge:--


      inde furor vulgi, quod numina vicinorum
   odit quisque locus, cum solos credat habendos
   esse deos, quos ipse colit.

      “thus ‘tis the popular fury that creates
   that all their neighbours’ gods each nation hates;
   each thinks [[think]] its own the [[genuine]]; in a word,
   the only deities to be adored.”


i have heard of a [[judge]] who, coming upon a sharp conflict betwixt
bartolus and aldus, and some point controverted with many contrarieties,
writ in the margin of his [[book]], “a [[question]] for a friend;” that is to
say, that [[truth]] was there so controverted and disputed that in a like
cause he might favour which of the parties he [[thought]] fit ‘twas only for
want of wit that he did not write “a [[question]] for a friend” throughout.
the advocates and judges [[judge]] of our times [[time]] find bias enough in all causes
to accommodate them to what they themselves [[think]] fit. in so infinite
a [[science]], depending upon the [[authority]] of so many opinions [[opinion]], and so
arbitrary a [[subject]], it cannot be but that of necessity an extreme
confusion of judgments [[judgment]] must arise; there is hardly any suit so clear
wherein opinions [[opinion]] do not very much differ; what one court has determined
one way another determines quite contrary, and itself contrary to that
at another [[time]]. of which we see very frequent examples [[example]], owing to that
practice admitted amongst us, and which is a marvellous blemish to the
ceremonious [[authority]] and lustre of our [[justice]], of not abiding by one
sentence, but running from [[judge]] to [[judge]], and court to court, to decide
one and the same cause.

as to the [[liberty]] of philosophical opinions [[opinion]] concerning [[vice]] and [[virtue]],
‘tis not necessary to be insisted upon; therein are found many opinions
that are [[better]] concealed than published to [[weak]] minds [[mind]]. arcesilaus said,
“that in venery it was no matter where, or with whom, it was committed:”
 _et obsccenas voluptates, si natura requirit, non genere, aut loco, aut
ordine, sed forma, otate, jigurâ, metiendas epicurus putat.... ne amores
quidem sanctos a sapiente alienos esse arbitrantur.... queeramus, ad
quam usque otatem juvenes amandi sint._ “and obscene pleasures [[pleasure]], if
nature requires them,” epicurus thinks [[think]], “are not to be measured either
by [[race]], [[kind]], place, or rank, but by [[age]], shape, and [[beauty]].... neither
are [[sacred]] loves [[love]] [[thought]] to be [[foreign]] to [[wise]] [[men]];... we are to
inquire till what [[age]] [[young]] [[men]] are to be loved.” these [[last]] two stoical
quotations, and the reproach that dicæarchus threw into the teeth of
plato himself, upon this account, show how much the soundest philosophy
indulges licenses and excesses very remote from [[common]] custom.

laws derive their [[authority]] from possession and custom. ‘tis dangerous
to trace them back to their beginning; they grow [[great]], and ennoble
themselves, like our rivers, by running on; but [[follow]] them upward to
their source, ‘tis but a little spring, scarce discernable,

that swells thus, and thus fortifies itself by growing old. do but
consult the ancient considerations that gave the first motion to this
famous torrent, so full of [[dignity]], awe, and reverence, you will find
them so [[light]] and [[weak]] that it is no wonder if these [[people]], who weigh
and reduce every thing to [[reason]], and who admit nothing by [[authority]], or
upon trust, have their judgments [[judgment]] often very remote, and differing from
those of the [[public]]. it is no wonder if [[people]], who take their pattern
from the first image of [[nature]], should in most of their opinions [[opinion]] swerve
from the [[common]] path; as, for [[example]], few amongst them would have
approved of the strict conditions of our marriages [[marriage]], and most of them
have been for having wives [[wife]] in [[common]], and without obligation; they would
refuse our ceremonies [[ceremony]]. chrysippus said, “that a philosopher would make
a dozen somersaults, aye, and without his breeches, for a dozen of
olives.” that philosopher would hardly have advised clisthenes to have
refused hippoclides the [[fair]] agarista his [[daughter]], for having seen him
stand on his head upon a table. metrocles somewhat indiscreetly broke
wind backwards while in disputation, in the presence of a [[great]] auditory
in his school, and kept himself hid in his own house for shame, till
crates coming to visit him, and adding to his consolations and reasons
the [[example]] of his own [[liberty]], by falling to try with him who should
sound most, cured him of that scruple, and withal drew him to his own
stoical sect, more [[free]] than that more reserved one of the peripatetics,
of which he had been till then. that which we call decency, not to dare
to do that in [[public]] which is decent enough to do in private, the stoics
call foppery; and to mince it, and to be so modest as to conceal and
disown what [[nature]], custom, and our desires [[desire]] publish and proclaim of our
actions, they reputed a [[vice]]. the other [[thought]] it was to undervalue the
mysteries of [[venus]] to draw them out of the private oratory, to expose
them to the view of the [[people]]; and that to bring them out from behind
the curtain was to debase them. modesty is a thing of weight; secrecy,
reservation, and circumspection, are parts of esteem. [[pleasure]] did
very ingeniously when, under the mask of [[virtue]], she sued not to be
prostituted in the open streets, trodden under foot, and exposed to
the [[public]] view, wanting the [[dignity]] and convenience of her private
cabinets. hence some say that to put down [[public]] stews is not only to
disperse fornication into all places, that was confined to one, but
moreover, by the difficulty, to incite wild and idle [[people]] to this
vice:--


      mochus es aufidiæ, qui vir,
   scævine, fuisti:
   rivalis fuerat qui tuus, ille vir est.
   cur aliéna placet tibi, quæ tua non placet uxor?
   numquid securus non potes arrigere?


this [[experience]] diversifies itself in a thousand examples [[example]]:--


      nullus in urbe fuit totâ, qui tangere vellet
   uxorem gratis, cæciliane, tuam,
   dum licuit: sed nunc, positis custodibus, ingens
   turba fututorum est. ingeniosus homo es.


a philosopher being taken in the very act, and [[asked]] what he was doing,
coldly replied, “i am planting [[man]];” no more blushing to be so caught
than if they had found him planting garlic.

it is, i suppose, out of tenderness and [[respect]] to the [[natural]] modesty
of [[mankind]] that a [[great]] and [[religious]] author is of [[opinion]] that this act
is so necessarily obliged to privacy and shame that he cannot persuade
himself there could be any absolute performance in those impudent
embraces of the cynics, but that they contented themselves to represent
lascivious gestures only, to maintain the impudence of their school’s
profession; and that, to eject what shame had withheld and restrained,
it was afterward necessary for them to withdraw into the shade. but he
had not thoroughly examined their debauches; for diogenes, playing the
beast with himself in [[public]], wished, in the presence of all that saw
him, that he could fill his belly by that exercise. to those who asked
him why he did not find out a more commodious place to [[eat]] in than
in the open street, he made [[answer]], “because i am hungry in the open
street.” the [[women]] [[philosophers]] who mixed with their sect, mixed also
with their persons [[person]], in all places, without reservation; and hipparchia
was not received into crates’s [[society]], but upon condition that she
should, in all things, [[follow]] the practice and customs of his [[rule]].
these [[philosophers]] set a [[great]] price upon [[virtue]], and renounce all other
discipline but the [[moral]]; and yet, in all their actions, they attributed
the [[sovereign]] [[authority]] to the election of their sage, and above the
laws; and gave no other curb to voluptuousness but moderation only, and
the conservation of the [[liberty]] of others.

heraclitus and protagoras, forasmuch as wine seemed bitter to the sick,
and pleasant to the sound, the rudder crooked in the water, and straight
when out, and such like contrary appearances as are found in subjects [[subject]],
argued thence that all subjects [[subject]] had, in themselves, the causes of these
appearances; and there was some bitterness in the wine which had some
sympathy with the sick man’s taste, and the rudder some bending quality
sympathizing with him that looks upon it in the water; and so of all
the rest; which is to say, that all is in all things, and, consequently,
nothing in any one; for, where all is, there is nothing.

this [[opinion]] put me in [[mind]] of the [[experience]] we have that there is
no sense or aspect of any thing, whether bitter or sweet, straight
or crooked, that the [[human]] [[mind]] does not find out in the writings it
undertakes to tumble over. into the cleanest, purest, and most perfect
words that can possibly be, how many lies [[lie]] and falsities have we
suggested! what heresy has not there found ground and testimony
sufficient to make itself embraced and defended! ‘tis for this that the
authors of such errors will never depart from proof of the testimony of
the interpretation of words. a [[person]] of [[dignity]], who would approve to
me, by [[authority]], the search of the philosopher’s stone, wherein he
was head over ears engaged, lately alleged to me at least five or six
passages of the bible upon which, he said, he first founded his attempt,
for the discharge of his [[conscience]] (for he is a divine); and, in [[truth]],
the [[idea]] was not only pleasant, but, moreover, very well accommodated to
the defence of this fine [[science]].

by this way the [[reputation]] of divining fables is acquired. there is no
fortune-teller, if we have this [[authority]], but, if a [[man]] will take the
pains to tumble and toss, and narrowly to peep into all the folds and
glosses of his words, he may make him, like the sibyls, say what he
will. there are so many ways of interpretation that it will be hard but
that, either obliquely or in a direct line, an ingenious wit will
find out, in every [[subject]], some air that will serve for his [[purpose]];
therefore we find a cloudy and ambiguous style in so frequent and
ancient use. let the author but make himself master of that, to busy
posterity about his predictions, which not only his own parts, but the
accidental favour of the matter itself, may do for him; and, as to
the rest, express himself, whether after a foolish or a subtle manner,
somewhat obscurely or contradictorily, ‘tis no matter;--a number of
wits, shaking and sifting him, will bring out a [[great]] many several
forms, either according to his meaning, or collateral, or contrary, to
it, which will all redound to his [[honour]]; he will see himself enriched
by the means of his disciples, like the regents of colleges by their
pupils yearly presents [[present]]. this it is which has given [[reputation]] to many
things of no worth at all; that has brought several writings in vogue,
and given them the fame of containing all sorts of matter can be
desired; one and the same thing receiving a thousand and a thousand
images and various considerations; nay, as many as we please.

is it possible that [[homer]] could design to say all that we make him
say, and that he designed so many and so various figures, as that the
divines, law-givers, captains, [[philosophers]], and all sorts of men
who treat of sciences [[science]], how variously and opposite soever, should
indifferently quote him, and support their arguments by his [[authority]],
as the [[sovereign]] [[lord]] and master of all offices, works [[work]], and artisans,
and counsellor-general of all enterprises? whoever has had [[occasion]] for
oracles and predictions has there found sufficient to serve his turn.
‘tis a wonder how many and how admirable concurrences an intelligent
person, and a particular friend of mine, has there found out in favour
of our [[religion]]; and cannot easily be put out of the conceit that it was
homer’s design; and yet he is as well acquainted with this author as
any [[man]] whatever of his [[time]]. and what he has found in favour of our
religion there, very many anciently have found in favour of theirs. do
but observe how [[plato]] is tumbled and tossed about; every one ennobling
his own opinions [[opinion]] by applying him to himself, and making him take what
side they please. they draw him in, and engage him in all the new
opinions the [[world]] receives; and make him, according to the different
course of things, differ from himself; every one makes him disavow,
according to his own sense, the manners and customs lawful in his [[age]],
because they are unlawful in ours; and all this with vivacity and [[power]],
according to the [[force]] and sprightliness of the wit of the interpreter.
from the same foundation that heraclitus and this sentence of his had,
“that all things had in them those forms that we discern,” democritus
drew quite a contrary conclusion,--“that objects have in them nothing
that we discern in them;” and because honey is sweet to one and bitter
to another, he thence argued that it was neither sweet nor bitter. the
pyrrhonians would say that they knew not whether it is sweet or bitter,
or whether the one or the other, or both; for these always gained
the highest point of dubitation. the cyrenaics held that nothing was
perceptible from without, and that that only was perceptible that
inwardly touched us, as [[pain]] and [[pleasure]]; acknowledging neither sound
nor colour, but [[certain]] affections only that we receive from them; and
that man’s [[judgment]] had no other seat protagoras believed that “what
seems true to every one, is true to every one.” the epicureans lodged
all [[judgment]] in the senses, and in the [[knowledge]] of things, and in
pleasure. [[plato]] would have the [[judgment]] of [[truth]], and [[truth]] itself,
derived from opinions [[opinion]] and the senses, to belong to the wit and
cogitation.

this discourse has put me upon the consideration of the senses, in which
lies the [[greatest]] foundation and pro°f of our ignorance. whatsoever is
known, is doubtless known by the faculty of the knower; for, seeing the
judgment proceeds from the operation of him that judges [[judge]], ‘tis reason
that this operation be performed by his means and will, not by the
constraint of another; as it would happen if we knew things by the
power, and according to the [[law]] of their essence. now all [[knowledge]] is
conveyed to us by the senses; they are our masters:--


      via qua munita fidei
   proxima fert humanum in pectus, templaque mentis;

      “it is the surest path that [[faith]] can find
   by which to enter [[human]] [[heart]] and [[mind]].”


science begins by them, and is resolved into them. after all, we should
know no more than a stone if we did not [[know]] there is sound, odour,
light, taste, measure, weight, softness, hardness, sharpness, colour,
smoothness, breadth, and depth; these are the platforms and principles
of the structure of all our [[knowledge]]; and, according to some, science
is nothing else but sense. he that could make me contradict the senses,
would have me by the throat; he could not make me go further back. the
senses are the beginning and the end of [[human]] [[knowledge]]:--


      invenies primis ab sensibns esse creatam
   notitiam veil; neque sensus posse refelli....
   quid majore fide porro, quam sensus, haberi debet?

      “of [[truth]], whate’er discoveries are made,
   are by the senses to us first conveyed;
   nor will one sense be baffled; for on what
   can we rely more safely than on that?”


let us attribute to them the least we can, we must, however, of
necessity grant them this, that it is by their means and mediation that
all our instruction is directed. cicero says, that chrysippus having
attempted to extenuate the [[force]] and [[virtue]] of the senses, presented to
himself arguments and so vehement oppositions to the contrary that he
could not satisfy himself therein; whereupon cameades, who maintained
the contrary side, boasted that he would make use of the very words and
arguments of chrysippus to controvert and confute him, and therefore
thus cried out against him: “o miserable! thy [[force]] has destroyed thee.”
 there can be nothing absurd to a greater [[degree]] than to maintain that
fire does not warm, that [[light]] does not shine, and that there is no
weight nor solidity in iron, which are things conveyed to us by the
senses; neither is there [[belief]] nor [[knowledge]] in [[man]] that can be
compared to that for certainty.

the first consideration i have upon the [[subject]] of the senses is that i
make a [[doubt]] whether or no [[man]] be furnished with all [[natural]] senses. i
see several animals who [[live]] an entire and [[perfect]] [[life]], some without
sight, others without hearing; who knows [[know]] whether to us also one, two,
three, or many other senses may not be wanting? for if any one be
wanting, our examination cannot discover the defect. ‘tis the privilege
of the senses to be the utmost limit of our discovery; there is nothing
beyond them that can assist us in exploration, not so much as one sense
in the discovery of another:--


      an poterunt oculos aures reprehendere? an aures
   tactus an hunc porro tactum sapor argnet oris?
   an confutabunt nares, oculive revincent?

      “can ears the [[eyes]], the touch the ears, [[correct]]?
   or is that touch by tasting to be check’d?
   or th’ other senses, shall the nose or eyes
   confute in their peculiar faculties?”


they all make the extremest limits of our ability:--


      seorsum cuique potestas divisa est, sua vis cuique est,

      “each has its [[power]] distinctly and alone,
   and every sense’s [[power]] is its own.”


it is impossible to make a [[man]] naturally blind conceive that he does not
see; impossible to make him [[desire]] sight, or to regret his defect; for
which [[reason]] we ought not to derive any assurance from the soul’s being
contented and satisfied with those we have; considering that it cannot
be sensible herein of its infirmity and imperfection, if there be any
such thing. it is impossible to say any thing to this blind [[man]], either
by reasoning, argument, or similitude, that can possess his imagination
with any apprehension of [[light]], colour, or sight; there’s nothing
remains behind that can push on the senses to evidence. those that
are born blind, whom we hear [[wish]] they could see, it is not that they
understand what they [[desire]]; they have learned from us that they want
something; that there is something to be [[desired]] that we have, which
they can name indeed and speak of its effect and consequences; but yet
they [[know]] not what it is, nor apprehend it at all.

i have seen a gentleman of a [[good]] [[family]] who was born blind, or at least
blind from such an [[age]] that he knows [[know]] not what sight is; who is so little
sensible of his defect that he makes use as we do of words proper for
seeing, and applies them after a manner wholly particular and his own.
they brought him a child to which he was god-father, which, having taken
into his arms, “good [[god]],” said he, “what a fine child! how beautiful
to look upon! what a pretty face it has!” he will say, like one of us,
“this room has a very fine prospect;--it is clear weather;--the sun
shines bright.” and moreover, being that hunting, tennis, and butts are
our exercises, and he has heard so, he has taken a liking to them, will
ride a-hunting, and believes [[belief]] he has as [[good]] share of the [[sport]] as we
have; and will express himself as angry or pleased as the [[best]] of us
all, and yet knows [[know]] nothing of it but by the ear. one cries out to him,
“here’s a hare!” when he is upon some even plain where he may safely
ride; and afterwards, when they tell him, “the hare is killed,” he will
be as overjoyed and proud of it as he hears others say they are. he will
take a tennis-ball in his left hand and strike it away with the racket;
he will shoot with a harquebuss at random, and is contented with what
his [[people]] tell him, that he is over, or wide.

who knows [[know]] whether all [[human]] [[kind]] commit not the like absurdity, for want
of some sense, and that through this default the [[greatest]] part of
the face of things is concealed from us? what do we [[know]] but that the
difficulties which we find in several works [[work]] of [[nature]] proceed hence;
and that several effects of animals, which exceed our capacity, are not
produced by faculty of some sense that we are defective in? and whether
some of them have not by this means a [[life]] more full and entire than
ours? we seize an apple with all our senses; we there find redness,
smoothness, odour, and sweetness; but it may have other virtues [[virtue]] besides
these, as to heat or binding, which no sense of ours can have any
reference unto. is it not likely that there are sensitive faculties in
nature that are fit to [[judge]] of and to discern those which we call the
occult properties [[property]] in several things, as for the loadstone to attract
iron; and that the want of such faculties is the cause that we
are ignorant of the true essence of such things? ‘tis perhaps some
particular sense that gives cocks to [[understand]] what hour it is at
midnight, and when it grows to be towards day, and that makes them crow
accordingly; that teaches [[teach]] chickens, before they have any [[experience]] of
the matter, to [[fear]] a sparrow-hawk, and not a goose or a peacock, though
birds of a much larger size; that cautions them against the hostile
quality the cat has against them, and makes them not to [[fear]] a dog; to
arm themselves against the mewing, a [[kind]] of flattering voice, of the
one, and not against the barking, a shrill and threatening voice, of the
other; that teaches [[teach]] wasps, ants, and rats, to fall upon the [[best]] pear
and the [[best]] cheese before they have tasted them, and inspires the stag,
elephant, and serpent, with the [[knowledge]] of a [[certain]] herb proper for
their cure. there is no sense that has not a mighty dominion, and that
does not by its [[power]] introduce an infinite number of knowledges. if
we were defective in the [[intelligence]] of sounds, of harmony, and of the
voice, it would cause an unimaginable confusion in all the rest of our
science; for, besides what belongs to the proper effect of every sense,
how many arguments, consequences, and conclusions do we draw to other
things, by comparing one sense with another? let an understanding man
imagine [[human]] [[nature]] originally produced without the sense of seeing,
and consider what ignorance and trouble such a defect would bring upon
him, what a darkness and blindness in the [[soul]]; he will then see by that
of how [[great]] importance to the [[knowledge]] of [[truth]] the privation of such
another sense, or of two or three, should we be so deprived, would be.
we have formed a [[truth]] by the consultation and concurrence of our five
senses; but perhaps we should have the [[consent]] and contribution of eight
or ten to make a [[certain]] discovery of it in its essence.

the sects that controvert the [[knowledge]] of [[man]] do it principally by the
uncertainty and weakness of our senses; for since all [[knowledge]] is
by their means and mediation conveyed unto us, if they fail in their
report, if they [[corrupt]] or alter what they bring us from without, if the
light which by them creeps into the [[soul]] be obscured in the passage,
we have nothing else to hold by. from this extreme difficulty all these
fancies proceed: “that every [[subject]] has in itself all we there find.
that it has nothing in it of what we [[think]] we there find;” and that of
the epicureans, “that the sun is no bigger than ‘tis judged by our sight
to be:--”


      quidquid id est, nihilo fertur majore figura,
   quam nostris oculis quam cemimus, esse videtur:

      “but be it what it will in our esteems,
   it is no bigger than to us it seems:”


that the appearances which represent a [[body]] [[great]] to him that is near,
and less to him that is more remote, are both true:--


      nee tamen hic oculos falli concedimus hilum....
   proinde animi vitium hoc oculis adfingere noli:

      “yet that the eye’s deluded we deny;
   charge not the mind’s faults [[fault]], therefore, on the eye:”


“and, resolutely, that there is no deceit in the senses; that we are to
lie at their [[mercy]], and seek elsewhere reasons [[reason]] to excuse the difference
and contradictions we there find, even to the inventing of lies [[lie]] and
other flams, if it come to that, rather than accuse the senses.”
 timagoras vowed that, by pressing or turning his eye, he could never
perceive the [[light]] of the candle to double, and that the seeming so
proceeded from the [[vice]] of [[opinion]], and not from the instrument. the
most absurd of all absurdities, with the epicureans, is to deny the
force and effect of the senses:--


      proinde, quod in quoquo est his visum tempore, verum est
   et, si non potuit ratio dissolvere causam,
   cur ea, quæ fuerint juxtim quadrata, procul sint
   visa rotunda; tamen præstat rationis egentem
   beddere mendose causas utriusque figuræ,
   quam manibus manifesta suis emittere quæquam,
   et violare fidem primam, et convellere tota
   fundamenta, quibus nixatur vita salusque:
   non modo enim ratio ruat omnis, vita quoque ipsa
   concidat extemplo, nisi credere sensibus ausis,
   procipitesque locos vitare, et cætera, quæ sint
   in genere hoc fugienda.

      “that what we see exists i will maintain,
   and if our feeble [[reason]] can’t explain
   why things seem square when they are very near,
   and at a greater distance round appear;
   ‘tis [[better]] yet, for him that’s at a pause,
   ‘t’ assign to either figure a false cause,
   than shock his [[faith]], and the foundations rend
   on which our safety and our [[life]] depend:
   for [[reason]] not alone, but [[life]] and all,
   together will with sudden ruin fall;
   unless we trust our senses, nor despise
   to shun the various dangers that arise.”


this so desperate and unphilosophical [[advice]] expresses only this,--that
human [[knowledge]] cannot support itself but by [[reason]] unreasonable,
foolish, and mad; but that it is yet [[better]] that [[man]], to set a greater
value upon himself, make use of any other remedy, how fantastic soever,
than to confess his necessary ignorance--a [[truth]] so disadvantageous to
him. he cannot avoid owning that the senses are the [[sovereign]] lords
of his [[knowledge]]; but they are uncertain, and falsifiable in all
circumstances; ‘tis there that he is to [[fight]] it out to the [[last]]; and
if his just forces [[force]] fail him, as they do, to supply that defect with
obstinacy, temerity, and impudence. in case what the epicureans say
be true, viz: “that we have no [[knowledge]] if the senses’ appearances
be false;” and if that also be true which the stoics say, “that the
appearances of the senses are so false that they can furnish us with no
manner of [[knowledge]],” we shall conclude, to the disadvantage of these
two [[great]] dogmatical sects, that there is no [[science]] at all.

as to the error and uncertainty of the operation of the senses, every
one may furnish himself with as many examples [[example]] as he pleases; so ordinary
are the faults [[fault]] and tricks they put upon us. in the echo of a valley the
sound of a trumpet seems to meet us, which comes from a place behind:--


      exstantesque procul medio de gurgite montes,
   classibus inter qnos liber patet exitus, idem
   apparent, et longe divolsi licet, ingens
   insula conjunctis tamen ex his ana videtur...
   et fugere ad puppim colies campique videntur,
   qnos agimns proter navim, velisque volamus....
   ubi in medio nobis equus acer obhæsit
   flamine, equi corpus transversum ferre videtur
   vis, et in adversum flumen contrudere raptim.

      “and rocks i’ th’ seas that proudly raise their head,
   though far disjoined, though [[royal]] navies spread,
   their sails between; yet if from distance shown,
   they seem an island all combin’d in one.
   thus ships, though driven by a prosperous gale,
   seem fix’d to sailors; those seem under sail
   that ride at anchor safe; and all [[admire]],
   as they row by, to see the rocks retire.
   thus, when in rapid streams my horse hath stood,
   and i look’d downward on the rolling flood;
   though he stood still, i [[thought]] he did divide
   the headlong streams, and strive against the tide,
   and all things seem’d to move on every side.”


take a musket-ball under the forefinger, the middle finger being lapped
over it, it feels [[feel]] so like two that a [[man]] will have much ado to persuade
himself there is but one; the end of the two fingers feeling each of
them one at the same [[time]]; for that the senses are very often masters of
our [[reason]], and constrain it to receive impressions which it judges [[judge]] and
knows to be false, is frequently seen. i set aside the sense of feeling,
that has its functions nearer, more lively, and substantial, that so
often, by the effects of the pains [[pain]] it helps the [[body]] to, subverts and
overthrows all those fine stoical resolutions, and compels him to cry
out of his belly, who has resolutely established this doctrine in his
soul--“that the colic, and all other pains [[pain]] and diseases, are indifferent
things, not having the [[power]] to abate any thing of the sovereign
felicity wherein the [[wise]] [[man]] is seated by his [[virtue]].” there is no
heart so effeminate that the rattle and sound of our drums and trumpets
will not inflame with [[courage]]; nor so sullen that the harmony of our
music will not rouse and cheer; nor so stubborn a [[soul]] that will
not [[feel]] itself struck with some reverence in considering the gloomy
vastness of our churches [[church]], the variety of ornaments, and order of our
ceremonies; and in hearing the solemn [[music]] of our organs, and the grace
and devout harmony of our voices. even those that come in with contempt
feel a [[certain]] shivering in their hearts [[heart]], and something of dread that
makes them begin to [[doubt]] their opinions [[opinion]]. for my part i do not think
myself [[strong]] enough to hear an ode of horace or catullus sung by a
beautiful [[young]] mouth without emotion; and zeno had [[reason]] to say “that
the voice was the flower of [[beauty]].” one would once make me [[believe]] that
a [[certain]] [[person]], whom all we frenchmen [[know]], had imposed upon me in
repeating some verses that he had made; that they were not the same upon
paper that they were in the air; and that my [[eyes]] would make a contrary
judgment to my ears; so [[great]] a [[power]] has pronunciation to give fashion
and value to works [[work]] that are left to the efficacy and modulation of the
voice. and therefore philoxenus was not so much to blame, hearing
one giving an ill accent to some composition of his, in spurning and
breaking [[certain]] earthen vessels of his, saying, “i break what is thine,
because thou corruptest what is mine.” to what end did those [[men]] who
have, with a firm resolution, destroyed themselves, turn away their
faces that they might not see the blow that was by themselves appointed?
and that those who, for their health, [[desire]] and command incisions to
be made, and cauteries to be applied to them, cannot endure the sight of
the preparations, instruments, and operations of the surgeon, being that
the sight is not in any way to participate in the [[pain]]? are not these
proper examples [[example]] to verify the [[authority]] the senses have over the
imagination? ‘tis to much [[purpose]] that we [[know]] these tresses were
borrowed from a page or a lackey; that this rouge came from [[spain]], and
this pearl-powder from the ocean sea. our sight will, nevertheless,
compel us to confess their [[subject]] more agreeable and more lovely
against all [[reason]]; for in this there is nothing of its own:--


      auferinrar cultu; gemmis, auroque teguntur
   crimina; pars minima est ipsa puella sni.
   sæpe, ubi sit quod ames, inter tarn multa requiras:
   decipit hac oculos ægide dives amor.

      “by dress we’re won; gold, gems, and [[rich]] brocades
   make up the pageant that your [[heart]] invades;
   in all that glittering figure which you see,
   the far least part of her own [[self]] is she;
   in [[vain]] for her you [[love]] amidst such cost
   you search, the mistress in such dress is lost.”


what a [[strange]] [[power]] do the poets attribute to the senses, that make
narcissus so desperately in [[love]] with his own shadow,


      cunctaque miratur, quibus est mirabilis ipse;
   se cupit imprudens, et, qui probat, ipse probatur;
   dumque petit, petitur; pariterque accendit, et ardet:

      “admireth all; for which to be admired;
   and inconsiderately himself desir’d.
   the praises [[praise]] which he gives his [[beauty]] claim’d,
   who seeks is sought, th’ inflamer is inflam’d:”


and pygmalion’s [[judgment]] so troubled by the impression of the sight
of his ivory statue that he loves [[love]] and adores it as if it were a living
woman!


      oscnla dat, reddique putat: sequi turque, tenetque,
   et credit tactis digitos insidere membris;
   et metuit, pressos veniat ne livor in artus.

      “he kisses, and believes [[belief]] he’s kissed again;
   seizes, and ‘twixt his arms his [[love]] doth strain,
   and thinks [[think]] the polish’d ivory thus held
   doth to his fingers amorous pressure yield,
   and has a timorous [[fear]], lest black and blue
   should in the parts with ardour press’d ensue.”


put a philosopher into a cage of small thin set bars of iron, hang him
on the top of the high tower of notre dame at [[paris]]; he will see, by
manifest [[reason]], that he cannot possibly fall, and yet he will find
(unless he has been used to the plumber’s trade) that he cannot [[help]] but
the sight of the excessive height will fright and astound him; for we
have enough to do to assure ourselves in the galleries of our steeples,
if they are made with open [[work]], although they are of stone; and some
there are that cannot endure so much as to [[think]] of it. let there be a
beam thrown over betwixt these two towers, of breadth sufficient to
walk upon, there is no philosophical [[wisdom]] so firm that can give us the
courage to walk over it as we should do upon the ground. i have often
tried this upon our mountains in these parts; and though i am one who am
not the most [[subject]] to be afraid, i was not able to endure to look into
that infinite depth without [[horror]] and trembling, though i stood above
my length from the edge of the precipice, and could not have fallen
unless i would. where i also observed that, what height soever the
precipice was, provided there were some tree, or some jutting out of a
rock, a little to support and divide the sight, it a little eases our
fears, and gives greater assurance; as if they were things by which in
falling we might have some relief; but that direct precipices we are
not to look upon without being giddy; _ut despici vine vertigine
timid ocvlorum animique non possit:_ “‘to that one cannot look without
dizziness;” which is a manifest imposture of the sight. and therefore
it was that that fine philosopher put out his own [[eyes]], to [[free]] the soul
from being diverted by them, and that he might philosophize at greater
liberty; but, by the same [[rule]], he should have dammed up his ears,
that theophrastus says are the most dangerous instruments about us for
receiving [[violent]] impressions to alter and disturb us; and, finally,
should have deprived himself of all his other senses, that is to say, of
his [[life]] and being; for they have all the [[power]] to command our [[soul]] and
reason: _fit etiam sope specie quâdam, sope vocum gravitate et cantibus,
ut pettantur animi vehementius; sope etiam cura et timoré,_ “for it
often falls out that the minds [[mind]] are more vehemently struck by some sight,
by the quality and sound of the voice, or by singing; and ofttimes also
by [[grief]] and [[fear]].” physicians hold that there are [[certain]] complexions
that are agitated by the same sounds and instruments even to fury. i
have seen some who could not hear a bone gnawed under the table without
impatience; and there is scarce any [[man]] who is not disturbed at the
sharp and shrill noise that the file makes in grating upon the iron;
as also to hear chewing near them, or to hear any one speak who has an
impediment in the throat or nose, will move some [[people]] even to anger
and [[hatred]]. of what use was that piping prompter of gracchus, who
softened, raised, and moved his master’s voice whilst he declaimed at
rome, if the movements and quality of the sound had not the [[power]] to
move and alter the judgments [[judgment]] of the auditory? in earnest, there is
wonderful [[reason]] to keep such a clutter about the firmness of this fine
piece, that suffers itself to be turned and twined by the motion and
accidents of so [[light]] a wind.

the same [[cheat]] that the senses put upon our understanding they have in
turn put upon them; the [[soul]] also some times [[time]] has its [[revenge]]; they lie
and contend which should most [[deceive]] one another. what we see and hear
when we are transported with passion, we neither see nor hear as it
is:--


   et solem geminum, et duplices se ostendere thebas.

   “thebes seems two cities [[city]], and the sun two suns.”


the object that we [[love]] appears to us more beautiful than it really is;


      multimodis igitur pravas turpesque videmus
   esse in deliciis, summoque in honore vigere;

      “hence ‘tis that ugly things in fancied dress
   seem [[gay]], look [[fair]] to lovers’ [[eyes]], and please;”


and that we hate more ugly; to a discontented and afflicted [[man]] the
light of the day seems dark and overcast. our senses are not only
depraved, but very often stupefied by the [[passions]] of the [[soul]]; how many
things do we see that we do not take notice of, if the [[mind]] be occupied
with other thoughts [[thought]]?


      in rebus quoque apertis noscere possis,
   si non advertas animum, proinde esse quasi omni
   tempore semotæ fuerint, longeque remotæ:

      “nay, even in plainest things, unless the mind
   take heed, unless she sets herself to find,
   the thing no more is seen, no more belov’d,
   than if the most obscure and most remov’d:”


it would appear that the [[soul]] retires within, and amuses the powers [[power]] of
the senses. and so both the inside and the outside of [[man]] is full of
infirmity and falsehood.

they who have compared our lives [[life]] to a [[dream]] were, perhaps, more in the
right than they were aware of. when we [[dream]], the [[soul]] lives [[life]], works [[work]], and
exercises all its faculties, neither more nor less than when awake;
but more largely and obscurely, yet not so much, neither, that the
difference should be as [[great]] as betwixt night and the meridian
brightness of the sun, but as betwixt night and shade; there she sleeps,
here she slumbers; but, whether more or less, ‘tis still dark, and
cimmerian darkness. we wake sleeping, and sleep waking. i do not see so
clearly in my sleep; but as to my being awake, i never found it clear
enough and [[free]] from clouds; moreover, sleep, when it is profound,
sometimes rocks even dreams [[dream]] themselves asleep; but our waking is never
so sprightly that it rightly purges and dissipates those whimsies, which
are waking dreams [[dream]], and worse than dreams [[dream]]. our [[reason]] and [[soul]] receiving
those fancies and opinions [[opinion]] that come in dreams [[dream]], and authorizing the
actions of our dreams [[dream]] with the like approbation that they do those of
the day, wherefore do we not [[doubt]] whether our [[thought]], our action, is
not another sort of dreaming, and our waking a [[certain]] [[kind]] of sleep?

if the senses be our first judges [[judge]], it is not ours that we are alone to
consult; for, in this faculty, beasts have as [[great]], or greater, than
we; it is [[certain]] that some of them have the sense of hearing more quick
than [[man]]; others that of seeing, others that of feeling, others that
of touch and taste. democritus said, that the gods and brutes had the
sensitive faculties more [[perfect]] than [[man]]. but betwixt the effects of
their senses and ours the difference is extreme. our spittle cleanses
and dries up our wounds; it kills the serpent:--


      tantaque in his rebas distantia differitasque est,
   ut quod aliis cibus est, aliis fuat acre venenum.
   sæpe etenim serpens, hominis contacta salivà,
   disperit, ac sese mandendo conficit ipsa:

      “and in those things the difference is so great
   that what’s one’s poison is another’s meat;
   for serpents often have been seen, ‘tis said,
   when touch’d with [[human]] spittle, to go mad,
   and bite themselves to [[death]]:”


what quality shall we attribute to our spittle? as it affects ourselves,
or as it affects the serpent? by which of the two senses shall we prove
the true essence that we seek for?

pliny says there are [[certain]] sea-hares in the indies that are poison to
us, and we to them; insomuch that, with the least touch, we kill
them. which shall be truly poison, the [[man]] or the fish? which shall we
believe, the fish of the [[man]], or the [[man]] of the fish? one quality of the
air infects a [[man]], that does the ox no harm; some other infects the ox,
but hurts not the [[man]]. which of the two shall, in [[truth]] and [[nature]], be
the pestilent quality? to them who have the jaundice, all things seem
yellow and paler than to us:--


      lurida præterea fiunt, quæcunque tuentur arquati.

      “besides, whatever jaundic’d [[eyes]] do view
   looks pale as well as those, and yellow too.”


they who are troubled with the disease that the physicians call
hyposphagma--which is a suffusion of [[blood]] under the skin--see all
things red and bloody. what do we [[know]] but that these humours [[humour]], which
thus alter the operations of sight, predominate in beasts, and are usual
with them? for we see some whose [[eyes]] are yellow, like us who have the
jaundice; and others of a bloody colour; ‘tis likely that the colours
of objects seem other to them than to us. which of the two shall make
a [[right]] [[judgment]]? for it is not said that the essence of things has a
relation to [[man]] only; hardness, whiteness, depth, and sharpness, have
reference to the service and [[knowledge]] of animals as well as to us, and
nature has equally designed them for their use. when we press down
the eye, the [[body]] that we look upon we perceive to be longer and more
extended;--many beasts have their [[eyes]] so pressed down; this length,
therefore, is perhaps the true form of that [[body]], and not that which our
eyes give it in the usual [[state]]. if we close the lower part of the eye
things appear double to us:--


      bina lucemarum fiorentia lumina flammis...
   et duplices hominum faciès, et corpora bina.

      “one lamp seems double, and the [[men]] appear
   each on two bodies [[body]] double heads to bear.”


if our ears be hindered, or the passage stopped with any thing, we
receive the sound quite otherwise than we usually do; animals, likewise,
who have either the ears hairy, or but a very little hole instead of an
ear, do not, consequently, hear as we do, but receive another [[kind]] of
sound. we see at festivals and theatres that, opposing a painted glass
of a [[certain]] colour to the [[light]] of the flambeaux, all things in the
place appear to us green, yellow, or violet:--


      et vulgo faciunt id lutea russaque vela,
   et ferrugina, cum, magnis intenta theatris,
   per malos vulgata trabesque, trementia pendent;
   namque ibi consessum caveai subter, et omnem
   scenai speciem, patrum, matrumque, deorumque
   inficiunt, coguntque suo volitare colore:

      “thus when pale curtains, or the deeper red,
   o’er all the spacious theatre are spread,
   which mighty masts and sturdy pillars bear,
   and the loose curtains wanton in the air;
   whole streams of colours from the summit flow,
   the rays divide them in their passage through,
   and stain the scenes, and [[men]], and gods below:”


‘tis likely that the [[eyes]] of animals, which we see to be of divers
colours, [[produce]] the appearance of bodies [[body]] the same with their [[eyes]].

we should, therefore, to make a [[right]] [[judgment]] of the oppositions of
the senses, be first agreed with beasts, and secondly amongst ourselves;
which we by no means are, but enter into dispute every [[time]] that one
hears, sees, or tastes something otherwise than another does, and
contests, as much as upon any other thing, about the [[diversity]] of the
images that the senses represent to us. a child, by the ordinary [[rule]] of
nature, hears, sees, and talks otherwise than a [[man]] of thirty years old;
and he than one of threescore. the senses are, in some, more obscure and
dusky, and more open and quick in others. we receive things variously,
according as we are, and according as they appear to us. those rings
which are cut out in the form of feathers, which are called _endless
feathers_, no eye can discern their size, or can keep itself from the
deception that on one side they enlarge, and on the other contract, and
come so a point, even when the ring is being turned round the finger;
yet, when you [[feel]] them, they seem all of an [[equal]] size. now, our
perception being so uncertain and so controverted, it is no more a
wonder if we are told that we may declare that snow appears [[white]] to us;
but that to affirm that it is in its own essence really so is more
than we are able to justify; and, this foundation being shaken, all
the [[knowledge]] in the [[world]] must of necessity fall to ruin. what! do
our senses themselves hinder one another? a picture seems raised and
embossed to the sight; in the handling it seems flat to the touch.
shall we say that musk, which delights the smell, and is offensive to
the taste, is agreeable or no? there are herbs and unguents proper for
one part o£ the [[body]], that are hurtful to another; honey is pleasant to
the taste, but offensive to the sight. they who, to assist their [[lust]],
used in ancient times [[time]] to make use of magnifying-glasses to represent the
members they were to employ bigger, by that ocular tumidity to please
themselves the more; to which of their senses did they give the
prize,--whether to the sight, that represented the members as large and
great as they would [[desire]], or to the feeling, which represented them
little and contemptible? are they our senses that supply the subject
with these different conditions, and have the subjects [[subject]] themselves,
nevertheless, but one? as we see in the bread we [[eat]], it is nothing but
bread, but, by being eaten, it becomes bones, [[blood]], flesh, hair; and
nails:--


      ut cibus in membra atque artus cum diditur omnes,
   disperit,, atque aliam naturam sufficit ex se;

      “as meats, diffus’d through all the members, lose
   their former [[state]], and different things compose;”


the humidity sucked up by the root of a tree becomes trunk, leaf, and
fruit; and the air, being but one, is modulated, in a trumpet, to a
thousand sorts of sounds; are they our senses, i would fain [[know]], that,
in like manner, form these subjects [[subject]] into so many divers qualities, or
have they them really such in themselves? and upon this [[doubt]] what can
we determine of their true essence? moreover, since the accidents of
disease, of raving, or sleep, make things appear otherwise to us than
they do to the healthful, the [[wise]], and those that are awake, is it
not likely that our [[right]] posture of health and understanding, and our
natural humours [[humour]], have, also, wherewith to give a being to things
that have a relation to their own condition, and accommodate them to
themselves, as well as when they are disordered;--that health is as
capable of giving them an aspect as sickness? why has not the temperate
a [[certain]] form of objects relative to it, as well as the intemperate?
and why may it not as well stamp it with its own [[character]] as the other?
he whose mouth is out of taste, says the wine is flat; the healthful man
commends its flavour, and the thirsty its briskness. now, our condition
always accommodating things to itself, and transforming them according
to its own posture, we cannot [[know]] what things truly are in themselves,
seeing that nothing comes to us but what is falsified and altered by the
senses. where the compass, the square, and the [[rule]], are crooked, all
propositions drawn thence, and all buildings erected by those guides,
must, of necessity, be also defective; the uncertainty of our senses
renders every thing uncertain that they [[produce]]:--


      denique ut in fabricâ, si prava est régula prima,
   normaque si fallax rectis regionibus exit,
   et libella aliquâ si ex parte claudicat hilum;
   omnia mendose fieri, atque obstipa necessum est,
   prava, cubantia, prona, supina, atque absona tecta;
   jam ruere ut quædam videantux’velle, ruantque
   prodita judiciis fallacibus omnia primis;
   sic igitur ratio tibi reram prava necesse est,
   falsaque sit, falsis quæcunque ab sensibus orta est.

      “but lastly, as in building, if the line
   be not exact and straight, the [[rule]] decline,
   or level false, how [[vain]] is the design!
   uneven, an ill-shap’d and tottering wall
   must rise; this part must sink, that part must fall,
   because the rules [[rule]] were false that fashion’d all;
   thus reason’s rules [[rule]] are false if all commence
   and rise from failing and from erring sense.”


as to what remains, who can be fit to [[judge]] of and to determine those
differences? as we say in controversies of [[religion]] that we must have
a [[judge]] neither inclining to the one side nor the other, [[free]] from all
choice and affection, which cannot be amongst christians [[christian]], just so it
falls out in this; for if he be old he cannot [[judge]] of the sense of
old [[age]], being himself a party in the case; if [[young]], there is the same
exception; if healthful, sick, asleep, or awake, he is still the
same incompetent [[judge]]. we must have some one exempt from all these
propositions, as of things indifferent to him; and by this [[rule]] we must
have a [[judge]] that never was.

to [[judge]] of the appearances that we receive of subjects [[subject]], we ought t
have a deciding instrument; to verify this instrument we must have
demonstration; to verify this demonstration an instrument; and here
we are round again upon the wheel, and no further advanced. seeing
the senses cannot determine our dispute, being full of uncertainty
themselves, it must then be [[reason]] that must do it; but no [[reason]] can be
erected upon any other foundation than that of another [[reason]]; and so we
run back to all infinity. our fancy does not apply itself to things that
are [[strange]], but is conceived by the mediation of the senses; and the
senses do not comprehend a [[foreign]] [[subject]], but only their own [[passions]];
by which means fancy and appearance are no part of the [[subject]], but only
of the passion and sufferance of sense; which passion and [[subject]] are
different things; wherefore whoever judges [[judge]] by appearances judges [[judge]] by
another thing than the [[subject]]. and to say that the [[passions]] of
the senses convey to the [[soul]] the quality of [[foreign]] subjects [[subject]] by
resemblance, how can the [[soul]] and understanding be assured of this
resemblance, having of itself no commerce with [[foreign]] subjects [[subject]]? as they
who never knew [[socrates]] cannot, when they see his picture, say it is
like him. now, whoever would, notwithstanding, [[judge]] by appearances, if
it be by all, it is impossible, because they hinder one another by their
contrarieties and discrepancies, as we by [[experience]] see: shall some
select appearances govern the rest? you must verify this select by
another select, the second by a third, and thus there will never be
any end to it. finally, there is no constant existence, neither of the
objects’ being nor our own; both we, and our judgments [[judgment]], and all mortal
things, are evermore incessantly running and rolling; and consequently
nothing [[certain]] can be established from the one to the other, both the
judging and the judged being in a continual motion and mutation.

we have no communication with being, by [[reason]] that all [[human]] [[nature]] is
always in the middle, betwixt being bom and dying, giving but an obscure
appearance and shadow, a [[weak]] and uncertain [[opinion]] of itself; and if,
perhaps, you fix your [[thought]] to apprehend your being, it would be but
like grasping water; for the more you clutch your hand to squeeze and
hold what is in its own [[nature]] flowing, so much more you lose of what
you would grasp and hold. so, seeing that all things are [[subject]] to
pass from one [[change]] to another, [[reason]], that there looks for a real
substance, finds itself deceived, not being able to apprehend any thing
that is subsistent and permanent, because that every thing is either
entering into being, and is not yet arrived at it, or begins to die
before it is bom. [[plato]] said, that bodies [[body]] had never any existence, but
only birth; conceiving that [[homer]] had made the ocean and thetis father
and [[mother]] of the gods, to show us that all things are in a perpetual
fluctuation, motion, and variation; the [[opinion]] of all the [[philosophers]],
as he says, before his [[time]], parmenides only excepted, who would not
allow things to have motion, on the [[power]] whereof he sets a mighty
value. pythagoras was of [[opinion]] that all matter was flowing and
unstable; the stoics, that there is no [[time]] [[present]], and that what we
call so is nothing but the juncture and meeting of the future and the
past; heraclitus, that never any [[man]] entered twice into the same river;
epichar-mus, that he who borrowed [[money]] but an hour ago does not owe
it now; and that he who was invited over-night to come the next day to
dinner comes nevertheless uninvited, considering that they are no more
the same [[men]], but are become others; and that there could not a mortal
substance be found twice in the same condition; for, by the suddenness
and quickness of the [[change]], it one while disperses, and another
reunites; it comes and goes after such a manner that what begins to be
born never arrives to the [[perfection]] of being, forasmuch as that birth
is never finished and never stays, as being at an end, but from the seed
is evermore changing and shifting one to another; as [[human]] seed is first
in the mother’s womb made a formless embryo, after delivered thence a
sucking infant, afterwards it becomes a boy, then a [[youth]], then a [[man]],
and at [[last]] a decrepit old [[man]]; so that [[age]] and subsequent [[generation]] is
always destroying and spoiling that which went before:--


      mutât enira mundi naturam totius ætas,
   ex alioque alius status excipere omnia debet;
   nec manet ulla sui similis res; omnia migrant,
   omnia commutât natura, et vertere cogit.

      “for [[time]] the [[nature]] of the [[world]] translates,
   and from preceding gives all things new states;
   nought like itself remains, but all do range,
   and [[nature]] forces [[force]] every thing to [[change]].”


“and yet we foolishly [[fear]] one [[kind]] of [[death]], whereas we have already
passed, and do daily pass, so many others; for not only, as heraclitus
said, the [[death]] of [[fire]] is [[generation]] of air, and the [[death]] of air
generation of water; but, moreover, we may more manifestly discern it in
ourselves; manhood dies, and passes away when [[age]] comes on; and [[youth]] is
terminated in the flower of [[age]] of a full-grown [[man]], infancy in [[youth]],
and the first [[age]] dies in infancy; yesterday died in to-day, and to-day
will [[die]] in to-morrow; and there is nothing that remains in the same
state, or that is always the same thing. and that it is so let this be
the proof; if we are always one and the same, how comes it to pass that
we are now pleased with one thing, and by and by with another? how
comes it to pass that we [[love]] or hate contrary things, that we praise
or condemn them? how comes it to pass that we have different affections,
and no more retain the same sentiment in the same [[thought]]? for it is not
likely that without mutation we should assume other [[passions]]; and, that
which suffers mutation does not remain the same, and if it be not the
same it is not at all; but the same that the being is does, like it,
unknowingly [[change]] and alter; becoming evermore another from another
thing; and consequently the [[natural]] senses [[abuse]] and [[deceive]] themselves,
taking that which seems for that which is, for want of well knowing
what that which is, is. but what is it then that truly is? that which is
eternal; that is to say, that never had beginning, nor never shall have
ending, and to which [[time]] can bring no mutation. for [[time]] is a mobile
thine, and that appears as in a shadow, with a matter evermore flowing
and running, without ever remaining stable and permanent; and to which
belong those words, _before and after, has been, or shall be:_ which at
the first sight, evidently show that it is not a thing that is; for it
were a [[great]] folly, and a manifest falsity, to say that that is which is
not ÿet being, or that has already ceased to be. and as to these words,
_present, instant, and now_, by which it seems that we principally
support and found the [[intelligence]] of [[time]], [[reason]], discovering, does
presently [[destroy]] it; for it immediately divides and splits it into the
_future and past_, being of necessity to consider it divided in two. the
same happens to [[nature]], that is measured, as to [[time]] that measures it;
for she has nothing more subsisting and permanent than the other, but
all things are either born, bearing, or dying. so that it were sinful to
say of [[god]], who is he only who _is, that he was, or that he shall be _;
for those are terms of declension, transmutation, and vicissitude, of
what cannot continue or remain in being; wherefore we are to conclude
that [[god]] alone is, not according to any measure of [[time]], but according
to an immutable and an immovable eternity, not measured by [[time]], nor
subject to any declension; before whom nothing was, and after whom
nothing shall be, either more new or more recent, but a real being, that
with one sole now fills the for ever, and that there is nothing that
truly is but he alone; without our being able to say, _he has been, or
shall be_; without beginning, and without end.” to this so religious
conclusion of a pagan i shall only add this testimony of one of the same
condition, for the close of this long and tedious discourse, which would
furnish me with endless matter: “what a vile and abject thing,” says he,
“is [[man]], if he do not raise himself above humanity!” ‘tis a [[good]] word
and a profitable [[desire]], but withal absurd; for to make the handle
bigger than the hand, the cubic longer than the arm, and to hope
to stride further than our legs can reach, is both impossible and
monstrous; or that [[man]] should rise above himself and [[humanity]]; for he
cannot see but with his [[eyes]], nor seize but with his hold. he shall
be exalted, if [[god]] will lend him an extraordinary hand; he shall exalt
himself, by abandoning and renouncing his own proper means, and by
suffering himself to be raised and elevated by means purely celestial.
it belongs to our [[christian]] [[faith]], and not to the stoical [[virtue]], to
pretend to that [[divine]] and miraculous metamorphosis.

chapter xiii

of judging of the [[death]] of another

when we [[judge]] of another’s assurance in [[death]], which, without [[doubt]], is
the most remarkable action of [[human]] [[life]], we are to take heed of one
thing, which is that [[men]] very hardly [[believe]] themselves to have arrived
to that period.  few [[men]] come to [[die]] in the [[opinion]] that it is their
latest hour; and there is nothing wherein the [[flattery]] of [[hope]] more
deludes us; it never ceases to whisper in our ears, “others have been
much sicker without dying; your condition is not so desperate as ‘tis
thought; and, at the worst, [[god]] has done other [[miracles]].”  which happens
by [[reason]] that we set too much value upon ourselves; it seems as if the
universality of things were in some measure to suffer by our dissolution,
and that it commiserates our condition, forasmuch as our disturbed sight
represents things to itself erroneously, and that we are of [[opinion]] they
stand in as much need of us as we do of them, like [[people]] at sea, to whom
mountains, fields, cities [[city]], [[heaven]] and [[earth]] are tossed at the same rate
as they are:

          “provehimur portu, terraeque urbesque recedunt:”

          [“we sail out of port, and cities [[city]] and lands [[land]] recede.”
           --aeneid, iii. 72.]

whoever saw old [[age]] that did not applaud the [[past]] and condemn the present
time, laying the [[fault]] of his misery and discontent upon the [[world]] and
the manners of [[men]]?

          “jamque caput quassans, grandis suspirat arator.
          et cum tempora temporibus praesentia confert
          praeteritis, laudat fortunas saepe parentis,
          et crepat antiquum genus ut pietate repletum.”

     [“now the old ploughman, shaking his head, sighs, and compares
     [[present]] times [[time]] with [[past]], often praises [[praise]] his parents’ [[happiness]], and
     talks of the old [[race]] as full of piety.”--lucretius, ii. 1165.]

we will make all things go along with us; whence it follows that we
consider our [[death]] as a very [[great]] thing, and that does not so easily
pass, nor without the solemn consultation of the stars:

               “tot circa unum caput tumultuantes dens,”

               [“all the gods to agitation about one [[man]].”
                --seneca, suasor, i. 4.]

and so much the more [[think]] it as we more value ourselves.  “what, shall
so much [[knowledge]] be lost, with so much damage to the [[world]], without a
particular concern of the destinies?  does so rare and exemplary a soul
cost no more the killing than one that is [[common]] and of no use to the
public?  this [[life]], that protects so many others, upon which so many
other lives [[life]] depend, that employs so vast a number of [[men]] in his service,
that fills so many places, shall it drop off like one that hangs but by
its own simple thread?   none of us lays it enough to [[heart]] that he is
but one: thence proceeded those words of caesar to his pilot, more tumid
than the sea that threatened him:

              “italiam si coelo auctore recusas,
               me pete: sola tibi causa est haec justa timoris,
               vectorem non nosce tuum; perrumpe procellas,
               tutela secure mea.”

     [“if you decline to sail to [[italy]] under the [[god’s]] protection, trust
     to mine; the only just cause you have to [[fear]] is, that you do not
     [[know]] your passenger; sail on, secure in my guardianship.”
      --lucan, v. 579.]

and these:

              “credit jam digna pericula caesar
               fatis esse suis; tantusne evertere, dixit,
               me superis labor est, parva quern puppe sedentem,
               tam magno petiere mari;”

     [“caesar now deemed these dangers worthy of his [[destiny]]: ‘what!’
     said he, ‘is it for the gods so [[great]] a task to overthrow me, that
     they must be fain to assail me with [[great]] seas in a [[poor]] little
     bark.’”--lucan, v. 653.]

and that idle fancy of the [[public]], that the sun bore on his face mourning
for his [[death]] a whole year:

              “ille etiam extincto miseratus caesare romam,
               cum caput obscura nitidum ferrugine texit:”

     [“caesar being [[dead]], the sun in mourning clouds, pitying [[rome]],
     clothed himself.”--virgil, georg., i. 466.]

and a thousand of the like, wherewith the [[world]] suffers itself to be so
easily imposed upon, believing that our interests affect the heavens [[heaven]], and
that their infinity is concerned at our ordinary actions:

          “non tanta caelo societas nobiscum est, ut nostro
          fato mortalis sit ille quoque siderum fulgor.”

     [“there is no such [[alliance]] betwixt us and [[heaven]], that the
     brightness of the stars should be made also mortal by our [[death]].”
      --pliny, nat.  hist., ii. 8.]

now, to [[judge]] of constancy and resolution in a [[man]] who does not yet
believe himself to be certainly in danger, though he really is, is not
reason; and ‘tis not enough that he [[die]] in this posture, unless he
purposely put himself into it for this effect.  it commonly falls out in
most [[men]] that they set a [[good]] face upon the matter and speak with great
indifference, to acquire [[reputation]], which they [[hope]] afterwards, living,
to enjoy.  of all whom i have seen [[die]], [[fortune]] has disposed their
countenances and no design of theirs; and even of those who in ancient
times have made away with themselves, there is much to be considered
whether it were a sudden or a lingering [[death]].  that cruel roman emperor
would say of his prisoners [[prisoner]], that he would make them [[feel]] [[death]], and if
any one killed himself in prison, “that fellow has made an escape from
me”; he would prolong [[death]] and make it [[felt]] by torments:

              “vidimus et toto quamvis in corpore caeso
               nil anima lethale datum, moremque nefandae,
               durum saevitix, pereuntis parcere morti.”

     [“we have seen in tortured bodies [[body]], amongst the wounds, none that
     have been mortal, inhuman mode of dire [[cruelty]], that means to kill,
     but will not let [[men]] [[die]].”--lucan, iv. i. 78.]

in plain [[truth]], it is no such [[great]] matter for a [[man]] in health and in a
temperate [[state]] of [[mind]] to resolve to kill himself; it is very easy to
play the villain before one comes to the point, insomuch that
heliogabalus, the most effeminate [[man]] in the [[world]], amongst his lowest
sensualities, could forecast to make himself [[die]] delicately, when he
should be forced thereto; and that his [[death]] might not give the [[lie]] to
the rest of his [[life]], had purposely built a sumptuous tower, the front
and base of which were covered with planks enriched with gold and
precious stones, thence to precipitate himself; and also caused cords
twisted with gold and crimson silk to be made, wherewith to strangle
himself; and a [[sword]] with the blade of gold to be hammered out to fall
upon; and kept poison in vessels of emerald and topaz wherewith to poison
himself according as he should like to choose one of these ways of dying:

          “impiger. . . ad letum et fortis virtute coacta.”

     [“resolute and brave in the face of [[death]] by a forced [[courage]].
     --“lucan, iv. 798.]

yet in [[respect]] of this [[person]], the effeminacy of his preparations makes
it more likely that he would have [[thought]] [[better]] on’t, had he been put to
the test.  but in those who with greater resolution have determined to
despatch themselves, we must examine whether it were with one blow which
took away the leisure of feeling the effect for it is to be questioned
whether, perceiving [[life]], by little and little, to steal away the
sentiment of the [[body]] mixing itself with that of the [[soul]], and the means
of repenting being offered, whether, i say, constancy and obstinacy in so
dangerous an intention would have been found.

in the civil wars [[war]] of caesar, lucius domitius, being taken in the abruzzi,
and thereupon poisoning himself, afterwards repented.  it has happened in
our [[time]] that a [[certain]] [[person]], being resolved to [[die]] and not having gone
deep enough at the first thrust, the sensibility of the flesh opposing
his arm, gave himself two or three wounds more, but could never prevail
upon himself to thrust [[home]].  whilst plautius silvanus was upon his
trial, urgulania, his grandmother, sent him a poniard with which, not
being able to kill himself, he made his servants cut his veins. albucilla
in tiberius [[time]] having, to kill himself, struck with too much
tenderness, gave his adversaries opportunity to imprison and put him to
death their own way.’ and that [[great]] leader, demosthenes, after his rout
in sicily, did the same; and c. fimbria, having struck himself too
weakly, entreated his servant to despatch him.  on the contrary,
ostorius, who could not make use of his own arm, disdained to employ that
of his servant to any other use but only to hold the poniard straight and
firm; and bringing his throat to it, thrust himself through.  ‘tis, in
truth, a morsel that is to be swallowed without chewing, unless a [[man]] be
thoroughly resolved; and yet adrian the [[emperor]] made his physician mark
and encircle on his pap the mortal place wherein he was to stab to whom
he had given orders to kill him.  for this [[reason]] it was that caesar,
being [[asked]] what [[death]] he [[thought]] to be the most [[desired]], made [[answer]],
“the least premeditated and the shortest.”--[tacitus, annals, xvi. 15]--
if caesar dared to say it, it is no cowardice in me to [[believe]] it.”
 a short [[death]],” says pliny, “is the [[sovereign]] [[good]] hap of [[human]] [[life]].
“people do not much [[care]] to recognise it.  no one can say that he is
resolute for [[death]] who fears [[fear]] to deal with it and cannot undergo it with
his [[eyes]] open: they whom we see in [[criminal]] punishments [[punishment]] run to their
death and hasten and press their execution, do it not out of resolution,
but because they will not give them selves leisure to consider it; it
does not trouble them to be [[dead]], but to [[die]]:

          “emodi nolo, sed me esse mortem nihil astigmia:”

     [“i have no [[mind]] to [[die]], but i have no objection to be [[dead]].”
      --epicharmus, apud cicero, tusc.  quaes., i. 8.]

‘tis a [[degree]] of constancy to which i have experimented, that i can
arrive, like those who plunge into dangers, as into the sea, with their
eyes shut.

there is nothing, in my [[opinion]], more illustrious in the [[life]] of
socrates, than that he had thirty whole days wherein to ruminate upon the
sentence of his [[death]], to have digested it all that [[time]] with a most
assured [[hope]], without [[care]], and without alteration, and with a series of
words and actions rather careless and indifferent than any way stirred or
discomposed by the weight of such a [[thought]].

that pomponius atticus, to whom cicero writes so often, being sick,
caused agrippa, his son-in-law, and two or three more of his [[friends]], to
be called to him, and told them, that having found all means practised
upon him for his recovery to be in [[vain]], and that all he did to prolong
his [[life]] also prolonged and augmented his [[pain]], he was resolved to put an
end both to the one and the other, desiring them to approve of his
determination, or at least not to lose their [[labour]] in endeavouring to
dissuade him.  now, having chosen to [[destroy]] himself by abstinence, his
disease was thereby cured: the remedy that he had made use of to kill
himself restored him to health.  his physicians and [[friends]], rejoicing at
so [[happy]] an event, and coming to congratulate him, found themselves very
much deceived, it being impossible for them to make him alter his
purpose, he telling them, that as he must one day [[die]], and was now so far
on his way, he would save himself the [[labour]] of beginning another [[time]].
this [[man]], having surveyed [[death]] at leisure, was not only not discouraged
at its approach, but eagerly sought it; for being content that he had
engaged in the combat, he made it a point of bravery to see the end; ‘tis
far beyond not fearing [[death]] to taste and relish it.

the story of the philosopher cleanthes is very like this: he had his gums
swollen and rotten; his physicians advised him to [[great]] abstinence:
having fasted two days, he was so much [[better]] that they pronounced him
cured, and permitted him to return to his ordinary course of diet; he, on
the contrary, already tasting some sweetness in this faintness of his,
would not be persuaded to go back, but resolved to proceed, and to finish
what he had so far advanced.

tullius marcellinus, a [[young]] [[man]] of [[rome]], having a [[mind]] to anticipate the
hour of his [[destiny]], to be rid of a disease that was more trouble to him
than he was willing to endure, though his physicians assured him of a
certain, though not sudden, cure, called a council of his [[friends]] to
deliberate about it; of whom some, says seneca, gave him the counsel that
out of unmanliness they would have taken themselves; others, out of
flattery, such as they [[thought]] he would [[best]] like; but a stoic said this
to him: “do not concern thyself, marcellinus, as if thou didst deliberate
of a thing of importance; ‘tis no [[great]] matter to [[live]]; thy servants and
beasts [[live]]; but it is a [[great]] thing to [[die]] handsomely, wisely, and
firmly.  do but [[think]] how long thou hast done the same things, [[eat]],
drink, and sleep, drink, sleep, and [[eat]]: we incessantly wheel in the same
circle.  not only ill and insupportable accidents, but even the satiety
of living, inclines a [[man]] to [[desire]] to [[die]].”  marcellinus did not stand
in need of a [[man]] to advise, but of a [[man]] to assist him; his servants were
afraid to meddle in the [[business]], but this philosopher gave them to under
stand that domestics are suspected even when it is in [[doubt]] whether the
death of the master were voluntary or no; otherwise, that it would be of
as ill [[example]] to hinder him as to kill him, forasmuch as:

               “invitum qui servat, idem facit occidenti.”

          [“he who makes a [[man]] [[live]] against his will, ‘tis as cruel
          as to kill him.”--horat., de arte poet., 467]

he then told marcellinus that it would not be unbecoming, as what is left
on the tables when we have eaten is given to the attendants, so, life
being ended, to distribute something to those who have been our servants.
now marcellinus was of a [[free]] and liberal spirit; he, therefore, divided
a [[certain]] sum of [[money]] amongst his servants, and consoled them.  as to
the rest, he had no need of steel nor of [[blood]]: he resolved to go out of
this [[life]] and not to run out of it; not to escape from [[death]], but to
essay it.  and to give himself leisure to deal with it, having forsaken
all manner of nourishment, the third day following, after having caused
himself to be sprinkled with warm water, he fainted by degrees [[degree]], and not
without some [[kind]] of [[pleasure]], as he himself declared.

in [[fact]], such as have been acquainted with these faintings, proceeding
from weakness, say that they are therein sensible of no manner of [[pain]],
but rather [[feel]] a [[kind]] of delight, as in the passage to sleep and [[best]].
these are [[studied]] and digested deaths [[death]].

but to the end that cato only may furnish out the whole [[example]] of
virtue, it seems as if his [[good]] with which the leisure to confront and
struggle with [[death]], reinforcing his [[destiny]] had put his ill one into the
hand he gave himself the blow, seeing he had [[courage]] in the danger,
instead of letting it go less.  and if i had had to represent him in his
supreme station, i should have done it in the posture of tearing out his
bloody bowels, rather than with his [[sword]] in his hand, as did the
statuaries of his [[time]], for this second murder was much more furious than
the first.




chapter xiv

that our [[mind]] hinders itself

‘tis a pleasant [[imagination]] to fancy a [[mind]] exactly balanced betwixt two
equal desires [[desire]]: for, doubtless, it can never pitch upon either, forasmuch
as the [[choice]] and application would manifest an inequality of esteem;
and were we set betwixt the bottle and the ham, with an [[equal]] appetite to
drink and [[eat]], there would doubtless be no remedy, but we must [[die]] of
thirst and [[hunger]].  to provide against this inconvenience, the stoics,
when they are [[asked]] whence the election in the [[soul]] of two indifferent
things proceeds, and that makes us, out of a [[great]] number of crowns [[crown]],
rather take one than another, they being all alike, and there being no
reason to incline us to such a preference, make [[answer]], that this
movement of the [[soul]] is extraordinary and irregular, entering into us
by a [[foreign]], accidental, and fortuitous impulse.  it might rather,
methinks, he said, that nothing presents [[present]] itself to us wherein there is
not some difference, how little soever; and that, either by the sight or
touch, there is always some [[choice]] that, though it be imperceptibly,
tempts and attracts us; so, whoever shall presuppose a packthread equally
strong throughout, it is utterly impossible it should break; for, where
will you have the breaking to begin? and that it should break altogether
is not in [[nature]].  whoever, also, should hereunto join the geometrical
propositions that, by the certainty of their demonstrations, conclude the
contained to be greater than the containing, the centre to be as [[great]] as
its circumference, and that find out two lines incessantly approaching
each other, which yet can never meet, and the philosopher’s stone, and
the quadrature of the circle, where the [[reason]] and the effect are so
opposite, might, peradventure, find some argument to second this bold
saying of pliny:

                    “solum certum nihil esse certi,
               et homine nihil miserius ant superbius.”

     [“it is only [[certain]] that there is nothing [[certain]], and that nothing
     is more miserable or more proud than [[man]].”--nat. hist., ii. 7.]




chapter xv

that our desires [[desire]] are augmented by difficulty

there is no [[reason]] that has not its contrary, say the wisest of the
philosophers.  i was just now ruminating on the excellent saying one of
the ancients alleges for the contempt of [[life]]: “no [[good]] can bring
pleasure, unless it be that for the loss of which we are beforehand
prepared.”

          “in aequo est dolor amissae rei, et timor amittendae,”

          [“the [[grief]] of losing a thing, and the [[fear]] of losing it,
          are [[equal]].”--seneca, ep., 98.]

meaning by this that the fruition of [[life]] cannot be truly pleasant to us
if we are in [[fear]] of losing it.  it might, however, be said, on the
contrary, that we hug and embrace this [[good]] so much the more earnestly,
and with so much greater affection, by how much we see it the less
assured and [[fear]] to have it taken from us: for it is evident, as fire
burns with greater fury when cold comes to mix with it, that our will is
more obstinate by being opposed:

               “si nunquam danaen habuisset ahenea turris,
               non esses, danae, de jove facta parens;”

     [“if a brazen tower had not held danae, you would not, danae, have
     been made a [[mother]] by jove.”--ovid, amoy., ii. 19, 27.]

and that there is nothing naturally so contrary to our taste as satiety
which proceeds from facility; nor anything that so much whets it as
rarity and difficulty:

     “omnium rerum voluptas ipso, quo debet fugare, periculo crescit.”

     [“the [[pleasure]] of all things increases by the same danger that
     should deter it.”--seneca, de benef., vii. 9.]

          “galla, nega; satiatur amor, nisi gaudia torquent.”

     [“galla, refuse me; [[love]] is glutted with joys that are not attended
     with trouble.”--martial, iv. 37.]

to keep [[love]] in breath, lycurgus made a decree that the [[married]] [[people]] of
lacedaemon should never enjoy one another but by stealth; and that it
should be as [[great]] a shame to take them in bed together as committing
with others.  the difficulty of assignations, the danger of surprise, the
shame of the morning,

                    “et languor, et silentium,
                    et latere petitus imo spiritus:”

     [“and languor, and [[silence]], and sighs, coming from the innermost
     [[heart]].”--hor., epod., xi. 9.]

these are what give the piquancy to the sauce.  how many very wantonly
pleasant sports [[sport]] spring from the most decent and modest [[language]] of the
works on [[love]]?  [[pleasure]] itself seeks to be heightened with [[pain]]; it is
much sweeter when it smarts and has the skin rippled.  the courtesan
flora said she never lay with pompey but that she made him wear the
prints of her teeth.--[plutarch, [[life]] of pompey, c. i.]

          “quod petiere, premunt arcte, faciuntque dolorem
          corporis, et dentes inlidunt saepe labellis .  .  .
          et stimuli subsunt, qui instigant laedere ad ipsum,
          quodcunque est, rabies unde illae germina surgunt.”

     [“what they have sought they dress closely, and cause [[pain]]; on the
     lips fix the teeth, and every kiss indents: urged by latent stimulus
     the part to wound”--lucretius, i. 4.]

and so it is in everything: difficulty gives all things their estimation;
the [[people]] of the march of ancona more readily make their vows to st.
james, and those of galicia to our [[lady]] of loreto; they make wonderful
to-do at liege about the baths of lucca, and in tuscany about those of
aspa: there are few romans seen in the fencing school of [[rome]], which is
full of french.  that [[great]] cato also, as much as us, nauseated his wife
whilst she was his, and longed for her when in the possession of another.
i was fain to turn out into the paddock an old horse, as he was not to be
governed when he smelt a mare: the facility presently sated him as
towards his own, but towards [[strange]] mares, and the first that passed by
the pale of his pasture, he would again fall to his importunate neighings
and his furious heats as before.  our appetite contemns and passes by
what it has in possession, to run after that it has not:

          “transvolat in medio posita, et fugientia captat.”

     [“he slights her who is close at hand, and runs after her
     who flees from him.”--horace, sat., i. 2, 108.]

to forbid us anything is to make us have a [[mind]] to’t:

                         “nisi to servare puellam
               incipis, incipiet desinere esse mea:”

     [“unless you begin to guard your mistress, she will soon begin
     to be no longer mine.”--ovid, amoy., ii. 19, 47.]

to give it wholly up to us is to beget in us contempt.  want and
abundance fall into the same inconvenience:

               “tibi quod superest, mihi quod desit, dolet.”

          [“your superfluities trouble you, and what i want
          troubles me.--“terence, phoym., i. 3, 9.]

desire and fruition equally afflict us.  the rigors of mistresses are
troublesome, but facility, to say [[truth]], still more so; forasmuch as
discontent and anger spring from the esteem we have of the thing [[desired]],
heat and actuate [[love]], but satiety begets disgust; ‘tis a blunt, dull,
stupid, tired, and slothful passion:

          “si qua volet regnare diu, contemnat amantem.”

     [“she who would long retain her [[power]] must use her lover ill.”
      --ovid, amor., ii. 19, 33]

                              “contemnite, amantes:
               sic hodie veniet, si qua negavit heri.”

     [“slight your mistress; she will to-day come who denied you
     yesterday.--“propertius, ii. 14, 19.]

why did poppea invent the use of a mask to hide the beauties [[beauty]] of her face,
but to enhance it to her lovers?  why have they veiled, even below the
heels, those beauties [[beauty]] that every one desires [[desire]] to show, and that every one
desires to see?  why do they cover with so many hindrances, one over
another, the parts where our desires [[desire]] and their own have their principal
seat?  and to what serve those [[great]] bastion farthingales, with which our
ladies fortify their haunches, but to allure our appetite and to draw us
on by removing them farther from us?

          “et fugit ad salices, et se cupit ante videri.”

     [“she flies to the osiers, and desires [[desire]] beforehand to be seen going.”
      --virgil, eclog., iii. 65.]

               “interdum tunica duxit operta moram.”

               [“the hidden robe has sometimes checked [[love]].”
                --propertius, ii. 15, 6.]

to what use serves the artifice of this virgin modesty, this grave
coldness, this severe countenance, this professing to be ignorant of
things that they [[know]] [[better]] than we who instruct them in them, but to
increase in us the [[desire]] to overcome, control, and trample underfoot at
pleasure all this [[ceremony]] and all these obstacles?  for there is not
only [[pleasure]], but, moreover, [[glory]], in conquering and debauching that
soft sweetness and that childish modesty, and to reduce a cold and
matronlike gravity to the [[mercy]] of our ardent desires [[desire]]: ‘tis a [[glory]],
say they, to triumph over modesty, chastity, and temperance; and whoever
dissuades ladies [[lady]] from those qualities, betrays both them and himself.
we are to [[believe]] that their hearts [[heart]] tremble with affright, that the very
sound of our words offends the purity of their ears, that they hate us
for talking so, and only yield to our importunity by a compulsive [[force]].
beauty, all powerful as it is, has not wherewithal to make itself
relished without the mediation of these little [[arts]].  look into [[italy]],
where there is the most and the finest [[beauty]] to be sold, how it is
necessitated to have recourse to extrinsic means and other artifices to
render itself charming, and yet, in [[truth]], whatever it may do, being
venal and [[public]], it remains feeble and languishing.  even so in virtue
itself, of two like effects, we notwithstanding look upon that as the
fairest and most worthy, wherein the most trouble and hazard are set
before us.

‘tis an effect of the [[divine]] providence to suffer the holy [[church]] to be
afflicted, as we see it, with so many storms and troubles, by this
opposition to rouse pious souls [[soul]], and to awaken them from that drowsy
lethargy wherein, by so long tranquillity, they had been immerged.
if we should lay the loss we have sustained in the number of those who
have gone astray, in the balance against the benefit we have had by being
again put in breath, and by having our zeal and [[strength]] revived by
reason of this opposition, i [[know]] not whether the utility would not
surmount the damage.

we have [[thought]] to tie the nuptial knot of our marriages [[marriage]] more fast and
firm by having taken away all means of dissolving it, but the knot of the
will and affection is so much the more slackened and made loose, by how
much that of constraint is drawn closer; and, on the contrary, that which
kept the marriages [[marriage]] at [[rome]] so long in [[honour]] and inviolate, was the
liberty every one who so [[desired]] had to break them; they kept their wives
the [[better]], because they might part with them, if they would; and, in the
full [[liberty]] of divorce, five hundred years and more passed away before
any one made use on’t.

     “quod licet, ingratum est; quod non licet, acrius urit.”

     [“what you may, is displeasing; what is forbidden, whets the
     appetite.--“ovid, amor., ii. 19.]

we might here introduce the [[opinion]] of an ancient upon this [[occasion]],
“that executions rather whet than dull the edge of vices [[vice]]: that they do
not beget the [[care]] of doing well, that being the [[work]] of [[reason]] and
discipline, but only a [[care]] not to be taken in doing ill:”

               “latius excisae pestis contagia serpunt.”

     [“the plague-sore being lanced, the infection spreads all the more.”
      --rutilius, itinerar. 1, 397.]

i do not [[know]] that this is true; but i experimentally [[know]], that never
civil [[government]] was by that means reformed; the order and regimen of
manners depend upon some other expedient.

the [[greek]] histories [[history]] make mention of the argippians, neighbours to
scythia, who [[live]] without either rod or stick for offence; where not only
no one attempts to attack them, but whoever can fly thither is safe, by
reason of their [[virtue]] and [[sanctity]] of [[life]], and no one is so bold as to
lay hands upon them; and they have applications made to them to determine
the controversies that arise betwixt [[men]] of other countries [[country]].  there is a
certain nation, where the enclosures of gardens and fields they would
preserve, are made only of a string of cotton; and, so fenced, is more
firm and secure than by our hedges and ditches.

                    “furem signata sollicitant .  .  .
                    aperta effractarius praeterit.”

          [“things sealed, up invite a thief: the housebreaker
          passes by open doors.”--seneca, epist., 68.]

peradventure, the facility of entering my house, amongst other things,
has been a means to preserve it from the [[violence]] of our civil wars [[war]]:
defence allures attempt, and defiance provokes an [[enemy]].  i enervated the
soldiers’ design by depriving the exploit of danger and all manner of
military [[glory]], which is wont to serve them for pretence and excuse:
whatever is bravely, is ever honourably, done, at a [[time]] when [[justice]] is
dead.  i render them the [[conquest]] of my house cowardly and base; it is
never shut to any one that knocks; my gate has no other guard than a
porter, and he of ancient custom and [[ceremony]]; who does not so much serve
to defend it as to offer it with more decorum and grace; i have no other
guard nor sentinel than the stars.  a gentleman would play the [[fool]] to
make a show of defence, if he be not really in a condition to defend
himself.  he who lies [[lie]] open on one side, is everywhere so; our ancestors
did not [[think]] of building frontier garrisons.  the means of assaulting,
i mean without battery or [[army]], and of surprising our houses, increases
every day more and more beyond the means to guard them; [[men’s]] wits are
generally bent that way; in [[invasion]] every one is concerned: none but the
rich in defence. mine was [[strong]] for the [[time]] when it was built; i have
added nothing to it of that [[kind]], and should [[fear]] that its [[strength]] might
turn against myself; to which we are to consider that a peaceable time
would require it should be dismantled.  there is danger never to be able
to regain it, and it would be very hard to keep; for in intestine
dissensions, your [[man]] may be of the party you [[fear]]; and where [[religion]] is
the pretext, even a man’s nearest relations become unreliable, with some
colour of [[justice]]. the [[public]] exchequer will not maintain our domestic
garrisons; they would exhaust it: we ourselves have not the means to do
it without ruin, or, which is more inconvenient and injurious, without
ruining the [[people]].  the condition of my loss would be scarcely worse.
as to the rest, you there lose all; and even your [[friends]] will be more
ready to accuse your want of vigilance and your improvidence, and your
ignorance of and indifference to your own [[business]], than to [[pity]] you.
that so many garrisoned houses have been undone whereas this of mine
remains, makes me apt to [[believe]] that they were only lost by being
guarded; this gives an [[enemy]] both an invitation and colour of [[reason]]; all
defence shows a face of [[war]].  let who will come to me in [[god’s]] name; but
i shall not invite them; ‘tis the retirement i have chosen for my repose
from [[war]].  i endeavour to withdraw this corner from the [[public]] tempest,
as i also do another corner in my [[soul]].  our [[war]] may put on what forms it
will, multiply and diversify itself into new parties; for my part, i stir
not.  amongst so many garrisoned houses, myself alone amongst those of my
rank, so far as i [[know]], in [[france]], have trusted purely to [[heaven]] for the
protection of mine, and have never removed plate, deeds, or hangings.
i will neither [[fear]] nor save myself by halves.  if a full acknowledgment
acquires the [[divine]] favour, it will stay with me to the end: if not, i
have still continued long enough to render my continuance remarkable and
fit to be recorded.  how?  why, there are thirty years that i have thus
lived.




chapter xvi

of glory

there is the name and the thing: the name is a voice which denotes and
signifies the thing; the name is no part of the thing, nor of the
substance; ‘tis a [[foreign]] piece joined to the thing, and outside it.
god, who is all fulness in himself and the height of all [[perfection]],
cannot augment or add anything to himself within; but his name may be
augmented and increased by the blessing and [[praise]] we attribute to his
exterior works [[work]]: which [[praise]], seeing we cannot incorporate it in him,
forasmuch as he can have no accession of [[good]], we attribute to his name,
which is the part out of him that is nearest to us.  thus is it that to
god alone [[glory]] and [[honour]] appertain; and there is nothing so remote from
reason as that we should go in quest of it for ourselves; for, being
indigent and necessitous within, our essence being imperfect, and having
continual need of amelioration, ‘tis to that we ought to employ all our
endeavour.  we are all hollow and empty; ‘tis not with wind and voice
that we are to fill ourselves; we want a more solid substance to repair
us: a [[man]] starving with [[hunger]] would be very simple to seek rather to
provide himself with a [[gay]] garment than with a [[good]] meal: we are to look
after that whereof we have most need.  as we have it in our ordinary
prayers:

          “gloria in excelsis deo, et in terra pax hominibus.”

we are in want of [[beauty]], health, [[wisdom]], [[virtue]], and such like essential
qualities: exterior ornaments should, be looked after when we have made
provision for necessary things.  divinity treats amply and more
pertinently of this [[subject]], but i am not much versed in it.

chrysippus and diogenes were the earliest and firmest advocates of the
contempt of [[glory]]; and maintained that, amongst all pleasures [[pleasure]], there was
none more dangerous nor more to be avoided than that which proceeds from
the approbation of others. and, in [[truth]], [[experience]] makes us sensible of
many very hurtful treasons in it.  there is nothing that so poisons
princes as [[flattery]], nor anything whereby wicked [[men]] more easily obtain
credit and favour with them; nor panderism so apt and so usually made use
of to [[corrupt]] the chastity of [[women]] as to wheedle and entertain them with
their own praises [[praise]].  the first charm the syrens made use of to allure
ulysses is of this [[nature]]:

         “deca vers nous, deca, o tres-louable ulysse,
          et le plus grand honneur don’t la grece fleurisse.”

     [“come hither to us, o admirable [[ulysses]], come hither, thou greatest
     ornament and [[pride]] of greece.”--homer, odysseus, xii. 184.]

these [[philosophers]] said, that all the [[glory]] of the [[world]] was not worth an
understanding man’s holding out his finger to obtain it:

          “gloria quantalibet quid erit, si gloria tantum est?”

     [“what is [[glory]], be it as glorious as it may be, if it be no more
     than [[glory]]?”--juvenal, sat., vii. 81.]

i say for it alone; for it often brings several commodities along with
it, for which it may justly be [[desired]]: it acquires us good-will, and
renders us less [[subject]] and exposed to insult and offence from others,
and the like.  it was also one of the principal doctrines of epicurus;
for this precept of his sect, conceal thy [[life]], that forbids [[men]] to
encumber themselves with [[public]] negotiations and offices, also
necessarily presupposes a contempt of [[glory]], which is the world’s
approbation of those actions we [[produce]] in [[public]].--[plutarch, whether
the saying, conceal thy [[life]], is well said.]--he that bids us conceal
ourselves, and to have no other concern but for ourselves, and who will
not have us known to others, would much less have us honoured and
glorified; and so advises idomeneus not in any sort to regulate his
actions by the [[common]] [[reputation]] or [[opinion]], except so as to avoid the
other accidental inconveniences that the contempt of [[men]] might bring upon
him.

these discourses are, in my [[opinion]], very true and [[rational]]; but we are,
i [[know]] not how, double in ourselves, which is the cause that what we
believe we do not [[believe]], and cannot disengage ourselves from what we
condemn.  let us see the [[last]] and dying words of epicurus; they are
grand, and worthy of such a philosopher, and yet they carry some touches
of the recommendation of his name and of that [[humour]] he had decried by
his precepts.  here is a letter that he dictated a little before his last
gasp:

                     “epicuyus to heymachus, health.

     “whilst i was passing over the [[happy]] and [[last]] day of my [[life]], i
     write this, but, at the same [[time]], afflicted with such [[pain]] in my
     bladder and bowels that nothing can be greater, but it was
     recompensed with the [[pleasure]] the remembrance of my inventions and
     doctrines brought to my [[soul]].  now, as the affection thou hast ever
     from thy infancy borne towards me and [[philosophy]] requires, take upon
     thee the protection of metrodorus’ [[children]].”

this is the letter.  and that which makes me interpret that the pleasure
he says he had in his [[soul]] concerning his inventions, has some reference
to the [[reputation]] he hoped for thence after his [[death]], is the manner of
his will, in which he gives order that amynomachus and timocrates, his
heirs, should, every january, defray the expense of the celebration of
his birthday as hermachus should appoint; and also the expense that
should be made the twentieth of every moon in entertaining the
philosophers, his [[friends]], who should assemble in [[honour]] of the memory of
him and of metrodorus.--[cicero, de finibus, ii. 30.]

carneades was head of the contrary [[opinion]], and maintained that [[glory]] was
to be [[desired]] for itself, even as we embrace our posthumous issue for
themselves, having no [[knowledge]] nor enjoyment of them.  this [[opinion]] has
not failed to be the more universally followed, as those commonly are
that are most suitable to our inclinations.  [[aristotle]] gives it the first
place amongst external goods [[good]]; and avoids, as too extreme vices [[vice]], the
immoderate either seeking or evading it.  i [[believe]] that, if we had the
books cicero wrote upon this [[subject]], we should there find pretty
stories; for he was so possessed with this passion, that, if he had
dared, i [[think]] he could willingly have fallen into the excess that others
did, that [[virtue]] itself was not to be coveted, but upon the account of
the [[honour]] that always attends it:

                   “paulum sepultae distat inertiae
                    celata virtus:”

          [“virtue concealed little differs from [[dead]] sloth.”
           --horace, od., iv.  9, 29.]

which is an [[opinion]] so false, that i am vexed it could ever enter into
the understanding of a [[man]] that was honoured with the name of
philosopher.

if this were true, [[men]] need not be [[virtuous]] but in [[public]]; and we should
be no further concerned to keep the operations of the [[soul]], which is the
true seat of [[virtue]], regular and in order, than as they are to arrive at
the [[knowledge]] of others.  is there no more in it, then, but only slily
and with circumspection to do ill?  “if thou knowest,” says carneades,
“of a serpent lurking in a place where, without suspicion, a [[person]] is
going to sit down, by whose [[death]] thou expectest an advantage, thou dost
ill if thou dost not give him caution of his danger; and so much the more
because the action is to be known by none but thyself.”  if we do not
take up of ourselves the [[rule]] of well-doing, if impunity pass with us for
justice, to how many sorts of wickedness shall we every day abandon
ourselves?  i do not find what sextus peduceus did, in faithfully
restoring the treasure that c. plotius had committed to his sole secrecy
and trust, a thing that i have often done myself, so commendable, as i
should [[think]] it an execrable baseness, had we done otherwise; and i think
it of [[good]] use in our days to recall the [[example]] of p. sextilius rufus,
whom cicero accuses to have entered upon an [[inheritance]] contrary to his
conscience, not only not against [[law]], but even by the determination of
the laws [[law]] themselves; and m. crassus and hortensius, who, by [[reason]] of
their [[authority]] and [[power]], having been called in by a stranger to share
in the succession of a forged will, that so he might secure his own part,
satisfied themselves with having no hand in the forgery, and refused not
to make their advantage and to come in for a share: secure enough, if
they could shroud themselves from accusations, witnesses, and the
cognisance of the laws [[law]]:

          “meminerint deum se habere testem, id est (ut ego arbitror)
          mentem suam.”

     [“let them consider they have [[god]] to witness, that is (as i
     interpret it), their own consciences.”--cicero, de offic., iii. 10.]

virtue is a very [[vain]] and frivolous thing if it derive its recommendation
from [[glory]]; and ‘tis to no [[purpose]] that we endeavour to give it a station
by itself, and separate it from [[fortune]]; for what is more accidental than
reputation?

     “profecto fortuna in omni re dominatur: ea res cunctas ex
     libidine magis, quhm ex vero, celebrat, obscuratque.”

     [“fortune rules [[rule]] in all things; it advances and depresses things
     more out of its own will than of [[right]] and [[justice]].”
      --sallust, catilina, c. 8.]

so to order it that actions may be known and seen is purely the [[work]] of
fortune; ‘tis [[chance]] that helps us to [[glory]], according to its own
temerity.  i have often seen her go before [[merit]], and often very much
outstrip it.  he who first likened [[glory]] to a shadow did [[better]] than he
was aware of; they are both of them things pre-eminently [[vain]] [[glory]] also,
like a shadow, goes sometimes before the [[body]], and sometimes in length
infinitely exceeds it.  they who instruct gentlemen only to employ their
valour for the obtaining of [[honour]]:

          “quasi non sit honestum, quod nobilitatum non sit;”

          [“as though it were not a [[virtue]], unless celebrated”
           --cicero de offic. iii. 10.]

what do they intend by that but to instruct them never to hazard
themselves if they are not seen, and to observe well if there be
witnesses [[present]] who may carry news of their valour, whereas a thousand
occasions of well-doing [[present]] themselves which cannot be taken notice
of?  how many brave [[individual]] actions are buried in the crowd of a
battle?  whoever shall take upon him to watch another’s behaviour in such
a confusion is not very busy himself, and the testimony he shall give of
his companions’ deportment will be evidence against himself:

          “vera et sapiens animi magnitudo, honestum illud,
          quod maxime naturam sequitur, in factis positum,
          non in gloria, judicat.”

     [“the true and [[wise]] magnanimity judges [[judge]] that the bravery which most
     follows [[nature]] more consists in act than [[glory]].”
      --cicero, de offic. i. 19.]

all the [[glory]] that i pretend to derive from my [[life]] is that i have lived
it in quiet; in quiet, not according to metrodorus, or arcesilaus, or
aristippus, but according to myself.  for seeing [[philosophy]] has not been
able to find out any way to tranquillity that is [[good]] in [[common]], let
every one seek it in particular.

to what do caesar and alexander owe the infinite grandeur of their renown
but to [[fortune]]?  how many [[men]] has she extinguished in the beginning of
their [[progress]], of whom we have no [[knowledge]], who brought as much courage
to the [[work]] as they, if their adverse hap had not cut them off in the
first sally of their arms?  amongst so many and so [[great]] dangers i do not
remember i have anywhere [[read]] that caesar was ever wounded; a thousand
have fallen in less dangers than the least of those he went through.  an
infinite number of brave actions must be performed without witness and
lost, before one turns to account.  a [[man]] is not always on the top of a
breach, or at the head of an [[army]], in the sight of his general, as upon a
scaffold; a [[man]] is often surprised betwixt the hedge and the ditch; he
must run the hazard of his [[life]] against a henroost; he must dislodge four
rascally musketeers out of a barn; he must prick out [[single]] from his
party, and alone make some attempts, according as necessity will have it.
and whoever will observe will, i [[believe]], find it experimentally true,
that occasions [[occasion]] of the least lustre are ever the most dangerous; and that
in the wars [[war]] of our own times [[time]] there have more brave [[men]] been lost in
occasions of little moment, and in the dispute about some little paltry
fort, than in places of [[greatest]] importance, and where their valour might
have been more honourably employed.

who thinks [[think]] his [[death]] achieved to ill [[purpose]] if he do not fall on some
signal [[occasion]], instead of illustrating his [[death]], wilfully obscures his
life, suffering in the meantime many very just occasions [[occasion]] of hazarding
himself to slip out of his hands; and every just one is illustrious
enough, every man’s [[conscience]] being a sufficient trumpet to him.

          “gloria nostra est testimonium conscientiae nostrae.”

     [“for our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our [[conscience]].”
      --corinthians, i. i.]

he who is only a [[good]] [[man]] that [[men]] may [[know]] it, and that he may be the
better esteemed when ‘tis known; who will not do well but upon condition
that his [[virtue]] may be known to [[men]]: is one from whom much service is not
to be expected:

              “credo ch ‘el reste di quel verno, cose
               facesse degne di tener ne conto;
               ma fur fin’ a quel tempo si nascose,
               che non a colpa mia s’ hor ‘non le conto
               perche orlando a far l’opre virtuose
               piu ch’a narrar le poi sempre era pronto;
               ne mai fu alcun’ de’suoi fatti espresso,
               se non quando ebbe i testimonii appresso.”

     [“the rest of the winter, i [[believe]], was spent in actions worthy of
     narration, but they were done so secretly that if i do not tell them
     i am not to blame, for orlando was more bent to do [[great]] acts than
     to boast of them, so that no deeds of his were ever known but those
     that had witnesses.”--ariosto, orlando furioso, xi. 81.]

a [[man]] must go to the [[war]] upon the account of [[duty]], and expect the
recompense that never fails brave and worthy actions, how private soever,
or even [[virtuous]] thoughts-the satisfaction that a well-disposed
conscience receives in itself in doing well.  a [[man]] must be valiant for
himself, and upon account of the advantage it is to him to have his
courage seated in a firm and secure place against the assaults of
fortune:

                   “virtus, repulsaa nescia sordidx
                    intaminatis fulget honoribus
                    nec sumit, aut ponit secures
                    arbitrio popularis aura.”

     [“virtue, repudiating all base repulse, shines in taintless
     honours [[honour]], nor takes nor leaves [[dignity]] at the mere will of the
     vulgar.”--horace, od., iii. 2, 17.]

it is not for outward show that the [[soul]] is to play its part, but for
ourselves within, where no [[eyes]] can pierce but our own; there she defends
us from the [[fear]] of [[death]], of [[pain]], of shame itself: there she arms us
against the loss of our [[children]], [[friends]], and fortunes [[fortune]]: and when
opportunity presents [[present]] itself, she leads us on to the hazards of [[war]]:

          “non emolumento aliquo, sed ipsius honestatis decore.”

     [“not for any [[profit]], but for the [[honour]] of honesty itself.”
      --cicero, de finib., i. 10.]

this [[profit]] is of much greater advantage, and more worthy to be coveted
and hoped for, than, [[honour]] and [[glory]], which are no other than a
favourable [[judgment]] given of us.

a dozen [[men]] must be called out of a whole nation to [[judge]] about an acre
of [[land]]; and the [[judgment]] of our inclinations and actions, the most
difficult and most important matter that is, we refer to the voice and
determination of the rabble, the [[mother]] of ignorance, [[injustice]], and
inconstancy.  is it reasonable that the [[life]] of a [[wise]] [[man]] should
depend upon the [[judgment]] of fools [[fool]]?

          “an quidquam stultius, quam, quos singulos contemnas,
          eos aliquid putare esse universes?”

     [“can anything be more foolish than to [[think]] that those you despise
     singly, can be anything else in general.”
      --cicero, tusc. quaes., v. 36.]

he that makes it his [[business]] to please them, will have enough to do and
never have done; ‘tis a mark that can never be aimed at or hit:

          “nil tam inaestimabile est, quam animi multitudinis.”

     [“nothing is to be so little understood as the minds [[mind]] of the
     multitude.”--livy, xxxi. 34.]

demetrius pleasantly said of the voice of the [[people]], that he made no
more account of that which came from above than of that which came from
below.  he [cicero] says more:

          “ego hoc judico, si quando turpe non sit, tamen non
          esse non turpe, quum id a multitudine laudatur.”

     [“i am of [[opinion]], that though a thing be not foul in itself,
     yet it cannot but become so when commended by the multitude.”
      --cicero, de finib., ii. 15.]

no art [[arts]], no activity of wit, could conduct our steps so as to [[follow]] so
wandering and so irregular a guide; in this windy confusion of the noise
of vulgar reports and opinions [[opinion]] that drive us on, no way worth anything
can be chosen.  let us not propose to ourselves so floating and wavering
an end; let us [[follow]] constantly after [[reason]]; let the [[public]] approbation
follow us there, if it will; and as it wholly depends upon [[fortune]], we
have no [[reason]] sooner to expect it by any other way than that.  even
though i would not [[follow]] the [[right]] way because it is [[right]], i should,
however, [[follow]] it as having experimentally found that, at the end of
the reckoning, ‘tis commonly the most [[happy]] and of [[greatest]] utility.

              “dedit hoc providentia hominibus munus,
               ut honesta magis juvarent.”

     [“this gift providence has given to [[men]], that honest things should
     be the most agreeable.”--quintilian, inst. orat., i. 12.]

the mariner of old said thus to [[neptune]], in a [[great]] tempest: “o [[god]], thou
wilt save me if thou wilt, and if thou choosest, thou wilt [[destroy]] me;
but, however, i will hold my rudder straight.”--[seneca, ep., 85.]--
i have seen in my [[time]] a thousand [[men]] supple, halfbred, ambiguous, whom
no one doubted to be more worldly-wise than i, lose themselves, where i
have saved myself:

               “risi successus posse carere dolos.”

          [“i have laughed to see cunning fail of [[success]].”
           --ovid, heroid, i. 18.]

paulus aemilius, going on the glorious expedition of macedonia, above all
things charged the [[people]] of [[rome]] not to speak of his actions during his
absence.  oh, the license of judgments [[judgment]] is a [[great]] disturbance to great
affairs!  forasmuch as every one has not the firmness of fabius against
common, adverse, and injurious tongues, who rather [[suffered]] his authority
to be dissected by the [[vain]] fancies of [[men]], than to do less well in his
charge with a favourable [[reputation]] and the popular applause.

there is i [[know]] not what [[natural]] sweetness in hearing one’s self
commended; but we are a [[great]] deal too fond of it:

         “laudari metuam, neque enim mihi cornea fibra est
          sed recti finemque extremumque esse recuso
          euge tuum, et belle.”

     [“i should [[fear]] to be praised, for my [[heart]] is not made of horn;
     but i deny that ‘excellent--admirably done,’ are the terms and
     final aim of [[virtue]].”--persius, i. 47.]

i [[care]] not so much what i am in the opinions [[opinion]] of others, as what i am in
my own; i would be [[rich]] of myself, and not by borrowing.  strangers see
nothing but events and outward appearances; everybody can set a [[good]] face
on the matter, when they have trembling and terror within: they do not
see my [[heart]], they see but my countenance.  one is [[right]] in decrying the
hypocrisy that is in [[war]]; for what is more easy to an old soldier than to
shift in a [[time]] of danger, and to counterfeit the brave when he has no
more [[heart]] than a chicken?  there are so many ways to avoid hazarding a
man’s own [[person]], that we have deceived the [[world]] a thousand times [[time]] before
we come to be engaged in a real danger: and even then, finding ourselves
in an inevitable necessity of doing something, we can make shift for that
time to conceal our apprehensions by setting a [[good]] face on the [[business]],
though the [[heart]] beats within; and whoever had the use of the platonic
ring, which renders those invisible that wear it, if turned inward
towards the palm of the hand, a [[great]] many would very often hide
themselves when they ought most to appear, and would repent being placed
in so honourable a post, where necessity must make them bold.

              “falsus [[honor]] juvat, et mendax infamia terret
               quem nisi mendosum et mendacem?”

          [“false [[honour]] pleases, and calumny affrights, the guilty
          and the sick.”--horace, ep., i. 16, 89.]

thus we see how all the judgments [[judgment]] that are founded upon external
appearances, are marvellously uncertain and doubtful; and that there is
no so [[certain]] testimony as every one is to himself.  in these, how many
soldiers’ boys are companions of our [[glory]]?  he who stands firm in an
open trench, what does he in that more than fifty [[poor]] pioneers who open
to him the way and cover it with their own bodies [[body]] for fivepence a day
pay, do before him?

              “non quicquid turbida roma
               elevet, accedas; examenque improbum in illa
               castiges trutina: nec to quaesiveris extra.”

     [“do not, if turbulent [[rome]] disparage anything, accede; nor correct
     a false balance by that scale; nor seek anything beyond thyself.”
      --persius, sat., i. 5.]

the dispersing and scattering our names into many mouths, we call making
them more [[great]]; we will have them there well received, and that this
increase turn to their advantage, which is all that can be excusable in
this design.  but the excess of this disease proceeds so far that many
covet to have a name, be it what it will.  trogus pompeius says of
herostratus, and titus livius of manlius capitolinus, that they were more
ambitious of a [[great]] [[reputation]] than of a [[good]] one.  this is very [[common]];
we are more solicitous that [[men]] speak of us, than how they speak; and it
is enough for us that our names are often mentioned, be it after what
manner it will.  it should seem that to be known, is in some sort to have
a man’s [[life]] and its duration in others’ keeping.  i, for my part, hold
that i am not, but in myself; and of that other [[life]] of mine which lies
in the [[knowledge]] of my [[friends]], to consider it naked and simply in
itself, i [[know]] very well that i am sensible of no fruit nor enjoyment
from it but by the vanity of a fantastic [[opinion]]; and when i shall be
dead, i shall be still and much less sensible of it; and shall, withal,
absolutely lose the use of those real advantages that sometimes
accidentally [[follow]] it.

i shall have no more handle whereby to take hold of [[reputation]], neither
shall it have any whereby to take hold of or to cleave to me; for to
expect that my name should be advanced by it, in the first place, i have
no name that is enough my own; of two that i have, one is [[common]] to all
my [[race]], and indeed to others also; there are two families [[family]] at [[paris]] and
montpellier, whose surname is montaigne, another in brittany, and one in
xaintonge, de la montaigne.  the transposition of one syllable only would
suffice so to ravel our affairs, that i shall share in their [[glory]], and
they peradventure will partake of my discredit; and, moreover, my
ancestors have formerly been surnamed, eyquem,--[eyquem was the
patronymic.]--a name wherein a [[family]] well known in [[england]] is at this
day concerned.  as to my other name, every one may take it that will, and
so, perhaps, i may [[honour]] a porter in my own stead.  and besides, though
i had a particular distinction by myself, what can it distinguish, when i
am no more?  can it point out and favour inanity?

              “non levior cippus nunc imprimit ossa?
               laudat posteritas!  nunc non e manibus illis,
               nunc non a tumulo fortunataque favilla,
               nascentur violae?”

     [“does the tomb press with less weight upon my bones?  do comrades
     [[praise]]?  not from my manes, not from the tomb, not from the ashes
     will violets grow.”--persius, sat., i. 37.]

but of this i have spoken elsewhere.  as to what remains, in a great
battle where ten thousand [[men]] are maimed or killed, there are not fifteen
who are taken notice of; it must be some very eminent greatness, or some
consequence of [[great]] importance that [[fortune]] has added to it, that
signalises a private action, not of a harquebuser only, but of a great
captain; for to kill a [[man]], or two, or ten: to expose a man’s self
bravely to the utmost peril of [[death]], is indeed something in every one of
us, because we there hazard all; but for the world’s concern, they are
things so ordinary, and so many of them are every day seen, and there
must of necessity be so many of the same [[kind]] to [[produce]] any notable
effect, that we cannot expect any particular renown from it:

              “casus multis hic cognitus, ac jam
               tritus, et a medio fortunae ductus acervo.”

     [“the accident is known to many, and now trite; and drawn from the
     midst of fortune’s heap.”--juvenal, sat., xiii. 9.]

of so many thousands of valiant [[men]] who have died within these fifteen
hundred years in [[france]] with their swords [[sword]] in their hands, not a hundred
have come to our [[knowledge]].  the memory, not of the commanders only, but
of battles [[battle]] and victories [[victory]], is buried and gone; the fortunes [[fortune]] of above half
of the [[world]], for want of a record, stir not from their place, and vanish
without duration.  if i had unknown events in my possession, i should
think with [[great]] ease to out-do those that are recorded, in all sorts of
examples.  is it not [[strange]] that even of the greeks [[greek]] and romans, with so
many writers and witnesses, and so many rare and [[noble]] exploits, so few
are arrived at our [[knowledge]]:

               “ad nos vix tenuis famx perlabitur aura.”

     [“an obscure rumour scarce is hither come.”--aeneid, vii. 646.]

it will be much if, a hundred years hence, it be remembered in general
that in our times [[time]] there were civil wars [[war]] in [[france]].  the lacedaemonians,
entering into [[battle]], sacrificed to the muses, to the end that their
actions might be well and worthily written, looking upon it as a divine
and no [[common]] favour, that brave acts should find witnesses that could
give them [[life]] and memory.  do we expect that at every musket-shot we
receive, and at every hazard we run, there must be a register ready to
record it?  and, besides, a hundred registers may enrol them whose
commentaries will not [[last]] above three days, and will never come to the
sight of any one.  we have not the thousandth part of ancient writings;
‘tis [[fortune]] that gives them a shorter or longer [[life]], according to her
favour; and ‘tis permissible to [[doubt]] whether those we have be not the
worst, not having seen the rest.  [[men]] do not write histories [[history]] of things of
so little moment: a [[man]] must have been general in the [[conquest]] of an
empire or a [[kingdom]]; he must have won two-and-fifty set battles [[battle]], and
always the weaker in number, as caesar did: ten thousand brave fellows
and many [[great]] captains lost their lives [[life]] valiantly in his service, whose
names lasted no longer than their wives [[wife]] and [[children]] lived:

                    “quos fama obscura recondit.”

     [“whom an obscure [[reputation]] conceals.”--aeneid, v. 302.]

even those whom we see behave themselves well, three months or three
years after they have departed hence, are no more mentioned than if they
had never been.  whoever will justly consider, and with due proportion,
of what [[kind]] of [[men]] and of what sort of actions the [[glory]] sustains itself
in the records of [[history]], will find that there are very few actions and
very few persons [[person]] of our times [[time]] who can there pretend any [[right]].  how many
worthy [[men]] have we known to survive their own [[reputation]], who have seen
and [[suffered]] the [[honour]] and [[glory]] most justly acquired in their [[youth]],
extinguished in their own presence?  and for three years of this
fantastic and imaginary [[life]] we must go and throw away our true and
essential [[life]], and engage ourselves in a perpetual death!  the sages
propose to themselves a nobler and more just end in so important an
enterprise:

          “recte facti, fecisse merces est: officii fructus,
          ipsum officium est.”

     [“the [[reward]] of a thing well done is to have done it; the fruit
     of a [[good]] service is the service itself.”--seneca, ep., 8.]

it were, peradventure, excusable in a painter or other artisan, or in a
rhetorician or a grammarian, to endeavour to raise himself a name by his
works; but the actions of [[virtue]] are too [[noble]] in themselves to seek any
other [[reward]] than from their own value, and especially to seek it in the
vanity of [[human]] judgments [[judgment]].

if this false [[opinion]], nevertheless, be of such use to the [[public]] as to
keep [[men]] in their [[duty]]; if the [[people]] are thereby stirred up to [[virtue]];
if princes [[prince]] are touched to see the [[world]] bless the memory of trajan, and
abominate that of nero; if it moves them to see the name of that great
beast, once so terrible and feared, so freely cursed and reviled by every
schoolboy, let it by all means increase, and be as much as possible
nursed up and cherished amongst us; and [[plato]], bending his whole
endeavour to make his [[citizens]] [[virtuous]], also advises them not to despise
the [[good]] repute and esteem of the [[people]]; and says it falls out, by a
certain [[divine]] inspiration, that even the wicked themselves oft-times, as
well by word as [[opinion]], can rightly distinguish the [[virtuous]] from the
wicked.  this [[person]] and his tutor are both marvellous and bold
artificers everywhere to add [[divine]] operations and revelations where
human [[force]] is wanting:

          “ut tragici poetae confugiunt ad deum,
          cum explicare argumenti exitum non possunt:”

     [“as tragic poets fly to some [[god]] when they cannot explain
     the issue of their argument.”--cicero, de nat. deor., i. 20.]

and peradventure, for this [[reason]] it was that timon, railing at him,
called him the [[great]] forger of [[miracles]].  seeing that [[men]], by their
insufficiency, cannot [[pay]] themselves well enough with current [[money]], let
the counterfeit be superadded.  ‘tis a way that has been practised by all
the legislators: and there is no [[government]] that has not some mixture
either of ceremonial vanity or of false [[opinion]], that serves for a curb
to keep the [[people]] in their [[duty]].  ‘tis for this that most of them have
their originals and beginnings fabulous, and enriched with supernatural
mysteries; ‘tis this that has given credit to bastard religions [[religion]], and
caused them to be countenanced by [[men]] of understanding; and for this,
that numa and sertorius, to possess their [[men]] with a [[better]] [[opinion]] of
them, fed them with this foppery; one, that the [[nymph]] egeria, the other
that his [[white]] hind, brought them all their counsels from the gods.
and the [[authority]] that numa gave to his laws [[law]], under the title of the
patronage of this [[goddess]], zoroaster, legislator of the bactrians and
persians, gave to his under the name of the [[god]] oromazis: trismegistus,
legislator of the [[egyptians]], under that of mercury; xamolxis, legislator
of the scythians, under that of vesta; charondas, legislator of the
chalcidians, under that of saturn; minos, legislator of the candiots,
under that of [[jupiter]]; lycurgus, legislator of the lacedaemonians, under
that of [[apollo]]; and draco and solon, legislators of the athenians, under
that of minerva.  and every [[government]] has a [[god]] at the head of it;
the others falsely, that truly, which [[moses]] set over the [[jews]] at their
departure out of [[egypt]].  the [[religion]] of the bedouins, as the sire de
joinville reports, amongst other things, enjoined a [[belief]] that the soul
of him amongst them who died for his [[prince]], went into another [[body]] more
happy, more beautiful, and more robust than the former; by which means
they much more willingly ventured their lives [[life]]:

         “in ferrum mens [[men]] prona viris, animaeque capaces
          mortis, et ignavum est rediturae parcere vitae.”

     [“men’s minds [[mind]] are prone to the [[sword]], and their souls [[soul]] able to bear
     [[death]]; and it is base to spare a [[life]] that will be renewed.”
      --lucan, i. 461.]

this is a very comfortable [[belief]], however erroneous.  every nation has
many such examples [[example]] of its own; but this [[subject]] would require a treatise
by itself.

to add one word more to my former discourse, i would advise the ladies [[lady]] no
longer to call that [[honour]] which is but their [[duty]]:

          “ut enim consuetudo loquitur, id solum dicitur
          honestum, quod est populari fama gloriosum;”

     [“as custom puts it, that only is called honest which is
     glorious by the [[public]] voice.”--cicero, de finibus, ii. 15.]

their [[duty]] is the mark, their [[honour]] but the outward rind.  neither would
i advise them to give this excuse for payment of their denial: for i
presuppose that their intentions, their [[desire]], and will, which are
things wherein their [[honour]] is not at all concerned, forasmuch as nothing
thereof appears without, are much [[better]] regulated than the effects:

          “qux quia non liceat, non facit, illa facit:”

     [“she who only refuses, because ‘tis forbidden, consents.”
      --ovid, amor., ii. 4, 4.]

the offence, both towards [[god]] and in the [[conscience]], would be as [[great]] to
desire as to do it; and, besides, they are actions so private and secret
of themselves, as would be easily enough kept from the [[knowledge]] of
others, wherein the [[honour]] consists, if they had not another [[respect]] to
their [[duty]], and the affection they bear to chastity, for itself.  every
woman of [[honour]] will much rather choose to lose her [[honour]] than to hurt
her [[conscience]].




chapter xvii

of presumption

there is another sort of [[glory]], which is the having too [[good]] an opinion
of our own worth.  ‘tis an inconsiderate affection with which we flatter
ourselves, and that represents us to ourselves other than we truly are:
like the passion of [[love]], that lends beauties [[beauty]] and graces to the object,
and makes those who are caught by it, with a depraved and corrupt
judgment, consider the thing which they [[love]] other and more [[perfect]] than
it is.

i would not, nevertheless, for [[fear]] of failing on this side, that a man
should not [[know]] himself aright, or [[think]] himself less than he is; the
judgment ought in all things to maintain its rights [[right]]; ‘tis all the reason
in the [[world]] he should discern in himself, as well as in others, what
truth sets before him; if it be caesar, let him boldly [[think]] himself the
greatest captain in the [[world]].  we are nothing but [[ceremony]]: ceremony
carries us away, and we leave the substance of things: we hold by the
branches, and quit the trunk and the [[body]]; we have taught the ladies [[lady]] to
blush when they hear that but named which they are not at all afraid to
do: we dare not call our members by their [[right]] names, yet are not afraid
to employ them in all sorts of debauchery: [[ceremony]] forbids us to express
by words things that are lawful and [[natural]], and we obey it: reason
forbids us to do things unlawful and ill, and nobody obeys it.  i find
myself here fettered by the laws [[law]] of [[ceremony]]; for it neither permits a
man to speak well of himself, nor ill: we will leave her there for this
time.

they whom [[fortune]] (call it [[good]] or ill) has made to, pass their lives [[life]] in
some eminent [[degree]], may by their [[public]] actions manifest what they are;
but they whom she has only employed in the crowd, and of whom nobody will
say a word unless they speak themselves, are to be excused if they take
the boldness to speak of themselves to such as are interested to know
them; by the [[example]] of lucilius:

              “ille velut fidis arcana sodalibus olim
               credebat libris, neque si male cesserat, usquam
               decurrens alio, neque si bene: quo fit, ut omnis,
               votiva pateat veluri descripta tabella
               vita senis;”

     [“he formerly confided his secret thoughts [[thought]] to his books [[book]], as to tried
     [[friends]], and for [[good]] and [[evil]], resorted not elsewhere: hence it
     came to pass, that the old man’s [[life]] is there all seen as on a
     votive tablet.”--horace, sat., ii. i, 30.]

he always committed to paper his actions and thoughts [[thought]], and there
portrayed himself such as he found himself to be:

     “nec id rutilio et scauro citra fidem; aut obtrectationi fuit.”

     [“nor was this considered a breach of [[good]] [[faith]] or a disparagement
     to rutilius or scaurus.”--tacitus, agricola, c. i.]

i [[remember]], then, that from my infancy there was observed in me i know
not what [[kind]] of carriage and behaviour, that seemed to relish of pride
and arrogance.  i will say this, by the way, that it is not unreasonable
to suppose that we have qualities and inclinations so much our own, and
so incorporate in us, that we have not the means to [[feel]] and recognise
them: and of such [[natural]] inclinations the [[body]] will retain a certain
bent, without our [[knowledge]] or [[consent]].  it was an affectation
conformable with his [[beauty]] that made alexander carry his head on one
side, and caused alcibiades to lisp; julius caesar scratched his head
with one finger,  which is the [[fashion]] of a [[man]] full of troublesome
thoughts; and cicero, as i [[remember]], was wont to pucker up his nose, a
sign of a [[man]] given to scoffing; such motions as these may imperceptibly
happen in us.  there are other artificial ones which i meddle not with,
as salutations and congees, by which [[men]] acquire, for the most part
unjustly, the [[reputation]] of being humble and courteous: one may be humble
out of [[pride]].  i am prodigal enough of my hat, especially in summer, and
never am so saluted but that i [[pay]] it again from persons [[person]] of what quality
soever, unless they be in my own service.  i should make it my request to
some princes [[prince]] whom i [[know]], that they would be more sparing of that
ceremony, and bestow that courtesy where it is more due; for being so
indiscreetly and indifferently conferred on all, it is thrown away to no
purpose; if it be without [[respect]] of persons [[person]], it loses its effect.
amongst irregular deportment, let us not forget that haughty one of the
emperor constantius, who always in [[public]] held his head upright and
stiff, without bending or turning on either side, not so much as to look
upon those who saluted him on one side, planting his [[body]] in a rigid
immovable posture, without suffering it to yield to the motion of his
coach, not daring so much as to spit, blow his nose, or wipe his face
before [[people]].  i [[know]] not whether the gestures that were observed in me
were of this first quality, and whether i had really any occult proneness
to this [[vice]], as it might well be; and i cannot be responsible for the
motions of the [[body]]; but as to the motions of the [[soul]], i must here
confess what i [[think]] of the matter.

this [[glory]] consists of two parts; the one in setting too [[great]] a value
upon ourselves, and the other in setting too little a value upon others.
as to the one, methinks these considerations ought, in the first place,
to be of some [[force]]: i [[feel]] myself importuned by an error of the soul
that displeases me, both as it is [[unjust]], and still more as it is
troublesome; i attempt to [[correct]] it, but i cannot root it out; and this
is, that i lessen the just value of things that i possess, and overvalue
things, because they are [[foreign]], absent, and none of mine; this humour
spreads very far.  as the prerogative of the [[authority]] makes husbands
look upon their own wives [[wife]] with a vicious disdain, and many fathers [[father]] their
children; so i, betwixt two [[equal]] merits [[merit]], should always be swayed against
my own; not so much that the [[jealousy]] of my advancement and bettering
troubles my [[judgment]], and hinders me from satisfying myself, as that of
itself possession begets a contempt of what it holds and rules [[rule]].  foreign
governments, manners, and languages [[language]] insinuate themselves into my esteem;
and i am sensible that latin allures me by the favour of its [[dignity]] to
value it above its due, as it does with [[children]], and the [[common]] sort of
people: the domestic [[government]], house, horse, of my neighbour, though no
better than my own, i prize above my own, because they are not mine.
besides that i am very ignorant in my own affairs, i am struck by the
assurance that every one has of himself: whereas there is scarcely
anything that i am sure i [[know]], or that i dare be responsible to myself
that i can do: i have not my means of doing anything in condition and
ready, and am only instructed therein after the effect; as doubtful of my
own [[force]] as i am of another’s.  whence it comes to pass that if i happen
to do anything commendable, i attribute it more to my [[fortune]] than
industry, forasmuch as i design everything by [[chance]] and in [[fear]].  i have
this, also, in general, that of all the opinions [[opinion]] antiquity has held of
men in gross, i most willingly embrace and adhere to those that most
contemn and undervalue us, and most push us to naught; methinks,
philosophy has never so [[fair]] a game to play as when it falls upon our
vanity and presumption; when it most lays open our irresolution,
weakness, and ignorance.  i look upon the too [[good]] [[opinion]] that [[man]] has
of himself to be the nursing [[mother]] of all the most false opinions [[opinion]], both
public and private.  those [[people]] who ride astride upon the epicycle of
mercury, who see so far into the heavens [[heaven]], are worse to me than a
tooth-drawer that comes to draw my teeth; for in my study, the [[subject]] of
which is [[man]], finding so [[great]] a variety of judgments [[judgment]], so profound a
labyrinth of difficulties, one upon another, so [[great]] [[diversity]] and
uncertainty, even in the school of [[wisdom]] itself, you may [[judge]], seeing
these [[people]] could not resolve upon the [[knowledge]] of themselves and their
own condition, which is continually before their [[eyes]], and within them,
seeing they do not [[know]] how that moves which they themselves move, nor
how to give us a description of the springs they themselves govern and
make use of, how can i [[believe]] them about the ebbing and flowing of the
nile?  the curiosity of knowing things has been given to [[man]] for a
scourge, says the holy [[scripture]].

but to return to what concerns myself; i [[think]] it would be very difficult
for any other [[man]] to have a meaner [[opinion]] of himself; nay, for any other
to have a meaner [[opinion]] of me than of myself: i look upon myself as one
of the [[common]] sort, saving in this, that i have no [[better]] an [[opinion]] of
myself; guilty of the meanest and most popular defects, but not disowning
or excusing them; and i do not value myself upon any other account than
because i [[know]] my own value.  if there be any vanity in the case, ‘tis
superficially infused into me by the treachery of my [[complexion]], and has
no [[body]] that my [[judgment]] can discern: i am sprinkled, but not dyed.  for
in [[truth]], as to the effects of the [[mind]], there is no part of me, be it
what it will, with which i am satisfied; and the approbation of others
makes me not [[think]] the [[better]] of myself.  my [[judgment]] is tender and nice,
especially in things that concern myself.

i ever repudiate myself, and [[feel]] myself float and waver by [[reason]] of my
weakness.  i have nothing of my own that satisfies my [[judgment]].  my sight
is clear and regular enough, but, at working, it is apt to dazzle; as i
most manifestly find in poetry: i [[love]] it infinitely, and am able to give
a tolerable [[judgment]] of other [[men’s]] works [[work]]; but, in [[good]] earnest, when i
apply myself to it, i play the child, and am not able to endure myself.
a [[man]] may play the [[fool]] in everything else, but not in poetry;

                         “mediocribus esse poetis
          non dii, non homines, non concessere columnae.”

     [“neither [[men]], nor gods, nor the pillars (on which the poets
     offered their writings) permit mediocrity in poets.”
      --horace, de arte poet., 372.]

i would to [[god]] this sentence was written over the doors of all our
printers, to forbid the entrance of so many rhymesters!

                    “verum
                    nihil securius est malo poetae.”

     [“the [[truth]] is, that nothing is more confident than a [[bad]] poet.”
      --martial, xii. 63, 13.]

why have not we such [[people]]?--[as those about to be mentioned.]--
dionysius the [[father]] valued himself upon nothing so much as his poetry;
at the olympic games, with chariots surpassing all the others in
magnificence, he sent also poets and musicians to [[present]] his verses,
with tent and pavilions royally gilt and hung with tapestry.  when his
verses came to be recited, the excellence of the delivery at first
attracted the attention of the [[people]]; but when they afterwards came to
poise the meanness of the composition, they first entered into disdain,
and continuing to nettle their judgments [[judgment]], presently proceeded to fury,
and ran to pull down and tear to pieces all his pavilions: and, that his
chariots neither performed anything to [[purpose]] in the [[race]], and that the
ship which brought back his [[people]] failed of making sicily, and was by
the tempest driven and wrecked upon the coast of tarentum, they certainly
believed was through the anger of the gods, incensed, as they themselves
were, against the paltry poem; and even the mariners who escaped from the
wreck seconded this [[opinion]] of the [[people]]: to which also the oracle that
foretold his [[death]] seemed to subscribe; which was, “that dionysius should
be near his end, when he should have overcome those who were [[better]] than
himself,” which he interpreted of the carthaginians, who surpassed him in
power; and having [[war]] with them, often declined the [[victory]], not to incur
the sense of this prediction; but he understood it ill; for the god
indicated the [[time]] of the advantage, that by favour and [[injustice]] he
obtained at [[athens]] over the tragic poets, [[better]] than himself, having
caused his own play called the leneians to be acted in emulation;
presently after which [[victory]] he died, and partly of the excessive joy he
conceived at the [[success]].

     [diodorus siculus, xv. 7.--the play, however, was called the
     “ransom of [[hector]].”  it was the games at which it was acted that
     were called leneian; they were one of the four dionysiac festivals.]

what i find tolerable of mine, is not so really and in itself, but in
comparison of other worse things, that i see well enough received.  i
envy the [[happiness]] of those who can please and hug themselves in what
they do; for ‘tis an easy thing to be so pleased, because a [[man]] extracts
that [[pleasure]] from himself, especially if he be constant in his
self-conceit.  i [[know]] a poet, against whom the [[intelligent]] and the
ignorant, abroad and at [[home]], both [[heaven]] and [[earth]] exclaim that he has
but very little notion of it; and yet, for all that, he has never a whit
the worse [[opinion]] of himself; but is always falling upon some new piece,
always contriving some new invention, and still persists in his [[opinion]],
by so much the more obstinately, as it only concerns him to maintain it.

my works [[work]] are so far from pleasing me, that as often as i review them,
they disgust me:

         “cum relego, scripsisse pudet; quia plurima cerno,
          me quoque, qui feci, judice, digna lini.”

     [“when i reperuse, i blush at what i have written; i ever see one
     passage after another that i, the author, being the [[judge]], consider
     should be erased.”--ovid, de ponto, i. 5, 15.]

i have always an [[idea]] in my [[soul]], and a sort of disturbed image which
presents me as in a [[dream]] with a [[better]] form than that i have made use
of; but i cannot catch it nor fit it to my [[purpose]]; and even that [[idea]] is
but of the meaner sort.  hence i conclude that the productions of those
great and [[rich]] souls [[soul]] of former times [[time]] are very much beyond the utmost
stretch of my [[imagination]] or my [[wish]]; their writings do not only satisfy
and fill me, but they astound me, and ravish me with admiration; i judge
of their [[beauty]]; i see it, if not to the utmost, yet so far at least as
‘tis possible for me to aspire.  whatever i undertake, i owe a sacrifice
to the graces, as plutarch says of some one, to conciliate their favour:

                   “si quid enim placet,
                    si quid dulce horninum sensibus influit,
                    debentur lepidis omnia gratiis.”

     [“if anything please that i write, if it infuse delight into men’s
     minds [[mind]], all is due to the charming graces.”  the verses are probably
     by some [[modern]] poet.]

they abandon me throughout; all i write is rude; polish and [[beauty]] are
wanting: i cannot set things off to any advantage; my handling adds
nothing to the matter; for which [[reason]] i must have it forcible, very
full, and that has lustre of its own.  if i pitch upon subjects [[subject]] that are
popular and [[gay]], ‘tis to [[follow]] my own inclination, who do not affect a
grave and ceremonious [[wisdom]], as the [[world]] does; and to make myself more
sprightly, but not my style more wanton, which would rather have them
grave and severe; at least if i may call that a style which is an inform
and irregular way of speaking, a popular jargon, a proceeding without
definition, division, conclusion, perplexed like that amafanius and
rabirius.--[cicero, acad., i. 2.]--i can neither please nor delight,
nor even tickle my readers: the [[best]] story in the [[world]] is spoiled by my
handling, and becomes flat; i cannot speak but in rough earnest, and am
totally unprovided of that facility which i observe in many of my
acquaintance, of entertaining the first comers and keeping a whole
company in breath, or taking up the ear of a [[prince]] with all sorts of
discourse without wearying themselves: they never want matter by reason
of the faculty and grace they have in taking hold of the first thing that
starts up, and accommodating it to the [[humour]] and capacity of those with
whom they have to do.  princes [[prince]] do not much affect solid discourses, nor i
to tell stories.  the first and easiest reasons [[reason]], which are commonly the
best taken, i [[know]] not how to employ: i am an ill orator to the common
sort.  i am apt of everything to say the extremest that i [[know]].  cicero
is of [[opinion]] that in treatises of [[philosophy]] the exordium is the hardest
part; if this be true, i am [[wise]] in sticking to the conclusion.  and yet
we are to [[know]] how to wind the string to all notes, and the sharpest is
that which is the most seldom touched.  there is at least as much
perfection in elevating an empty as in supporting a weighty thing.  a man
must sometimes superficially handle things, and sometimes push them [[home]].
i [[know]] very well that most [[men]] keep themselves in this lower form from
not conceiving things otherwise than by this outward bark; but i likewise
know that the [[greatest]] masters, and xenophon and [[plato]] are often seen to
stoop to this low and popular manner of speaking and treating of things,
but supporting it with graces which never fail them.

farther, my [[language]] has nothing in it that is facile and polished; ‘tis
rough, [[free]], and irregular, and as such pleases, if not my [[judgment]], at
all events my inclination, but i very well perceive that i sometimes give
myself too much rein, and that by endeavouring to avoid art [[arts]] and
affectation i fall into the other inconvenience:

                        “brevis esse laboro,
                         obscurus fio.”

          [ endeavouring to be brief, i become obscure.”
           --hor., art [[arts]]. poet., 25.]

plato says, that the long or the short are not properties [[property]], that either
take away or give value to [[language]].  should i attempt to [[follow]] the
other more moderate, [[united]], and regular style, i should never attain to
it; and though the short round periods of sallust [[best]] suit with my
humour, yet i find caesar much grander and harder to imitate; and though
my inclination would rather prompt me to imitate seneca’s way of writing,
yet i do nevertheless more esteem that of plutarch.  both in doing and
speaking i simply [[follow]] my own [[natural]] way; whence, peradventure, it
falls out that i am [[better]] at speaking than writing.  motion and action
animate words, especially in those who lay about them briskly, as i do,
and grow hot.  the comportment, the countenance; the voice, the robe, the
place, will set off some things that of themselves would appear no better
than prating.  messalla complains in tacitus of the straitness of some
garments in his [[time]], and of the [[fashion]] of the benches where the orators
were to declaim, that were a disadvantage to their eloquence.

my french tongue is corrupted, both in the pronunciation and otherwise,
by the barbarism of my [[country]].  i never saw a [[man]] who was a native of
any of the provinces on this side of the [[kingdom]] who had not a twang of
his place of birth, and that was not offensive to ears that were purely
french.  and yet it is not that i am so [[perfect]] in my perigordin: for i
can no more speak it than high dutch, nor do i much [[care]].  ‘tis a
language (as the rest about me on every side, of poitou, xaintonge,
angoumousin, limousin, auvergne), a [[poor]], drawling, scurvy [[language]].
there is, indeed, above us towards the mountains a sort of gascon spoken,
that i am mightily taken with: blunt, brief, significant, and in [[truth]] a
more manly and [[military]] [[language]] than any other i am acquainted with, as
sinewy, powerful, and pertinent as the french is graceful, neat, and
luxuriant.

as to the latin, which was given me for my [[mother]] tongue, i have by
discontinuance lost the use of speaking it, and, indeed, of writing it
too, wherein i formerly had a particular [[reputation]], by which you may see
how inconsiderable i am on that side.

beauty is a thing of [[great]] recommendation in the correspondence amongst
men; ‘tis the first means of acquiring the favour and [[good]] liking of one
another, and no [[man]] is so barbarous and morose as not to perceive himself
in some sort struck with its attraction.  the [[body]] has a [[great]] share in
our being, has an eminent place there, and therefore its structure and
composition are of very just consideration.  they who go about to
disunite and separate our two principal parts from one another are to
blame; we must, on the contrary, reunite and rejoin them.  we must
command the [[soul]] not to withdraw and entertain itself apart, not to
despise and abandon the [[body]] (neither can she do it but by some apish
counterfeit), but to unite herself close to it, to embrace, cherish,
assist, govern, and advise it, and to bring it back and set it into the
true way when it wanders; in sum, to espouse and be a husband to it, so
that their effects may not appear to be diverse and contrary, but uniform
and concurring.  christians [[christian]] have a particular instruction concerning this
connection, for they [[know]] that the [[divine]] [[justice]] embraces this society
and juncture of [[body]] and [[soul]], even to the making the [[body]] capable of
eternal rewards [[reward]]; and that [[god]] has an eye to the whole man’s ways, and
wills that he receive entire chastisement or [[reward]] according to his
demerits or merits [[merit]].  the sect of the peripatetics, of all sects the most
sociable, attribute to [[wisdom]] this sole [[care]] equally to provide for the
good of these two associate parts: and the other sects, in not
sufficiently applying themselves to the consideration of this mixture,
show themselves to be divided, one for the [[body]] and the other for the
soul, with [[equal]] error, and to have lost sight of their [[subject]], which is
man, and their guide, which they generally confess to be [[nature]].  the
first distinction that ever was amongst [[men]], and the first consideration
that gave some pre-eminence over others, ‘tis likely was the advantage of
beauty:

              “agros divisere atque dedere
               pro facie cujusque, et viribus ingenioque;
               nam facies multum valuit, viresque vigebant.”

     [“they distributed and conferred the lands [[land]] to every [[man]] according
     to his [[beauty]] and [[strength]] and understanding, for [[beauty]] was much
     esteemed and [[strength]] was in favour.”--lucretius, v. 1109.]

now i am of something lower than the middle stature, a defect that not
only borders upon deformity, but carries withal a [[great]] deal of
inconvenience along with it, especially for those who are in office and
command; for the [[authority]] which a graceful presence and a majestic mien
beget is wanting.  c. marius did not willingly enlist any soldiers who
were not six feet high.  the courtier has, indeed, [[reason]] to [[desire]] a
moderate stature in the gentlemen he is setting forth, rather than any
other, and to reject all strangeness that should make him be pointed at.
but if i were to choose whether this medium must be rather below than
above the [[common]] standard, i would not have it so in a soldier.  little
men, says [[aristotle]], are pretty, but not handsome; and greatness of soul
is discovered in a [[great]] [[body]], as [[beauty]] is in a conspicuous stature: the
ethiopians and indians [[indian]], says he, in choosing their kings [[king]] and magistrates,
had regard to the [[beauty]] and stature of their persons [[person]].  they had [[reason]];
for it creates [[respect]] in those who [[follow]] them, and is a terror to the
enemy, to see a leader of a brave and goodly stature march at the head of
a battalion:

         “ipse inter primos praestanti corpore turnus
          vertitur arma, tenens, et toto vertice supra est.”

     [“in the first rank marches turnus, brandishing his weapon,
     taller by a head than all the rest.”--virgil, aeneid, vii. 783.]

our holy and heavenly [[king]], of whom every circumstance is most carefully
and with the [[greatest]] [[religion]] and reverence to be observed, has not
himself rejected bodily recommendation,


               “speciosus forma prae filiis hominum.”

          [“he is fairer than the [[children]] of [[men]].”--psalm xiv. 3.]

and [[plato]], together with temperance and fortitude, requires [[beauty]] in the
conservators of his [[republic]].  it would vex you that a [[man]] should apply
himself to you amongst your servants to inquire where monsieur is, and
that you should only have the remainder of the compliment of the hat that
is made to your barber or your secretary; as it happened to poor
philopoemen, who arriving the first of all his company at an inn where he
was expected, the hostess, who knew him not, and saw him an unsightly
fellow, employed him to go [[help]] her maids a little to draw water, and
make a [[fire]] against philopoemen’s coming; the gentlemen of his train
arriving presently after, and surprised to see him busy in this fine
employment, for he failed not to obey his landlady’s command, [[asked]] him
what he was doing there: “i am,” said he, “paying the penalty of my
ugliness.”  the other beauties [[beauty]] belong to [[women]]; the [[beauty]] of stature is
the only [[beauty]] of [[men]].  where there is a contemptible stature, neither
the largeness and roundness of the forehead, nor the whiteness and
sweetness of the [[eyes]], nor the moderate proportion of the nose, nor the
littleness of the ears and mouth, nor the evenness and whiteness of the
teeth, nor the thickness of a well-set brown beard, shining like the husk
of a chestnut, nor curled hair, nor the just proportion of the head, nor
a fresh [[complexion]], nor a pleasing air of a face, nor a [[body]] without any
offensive scent, nor the just proportion of limbs, can make a handsome
man.  i am, as to the rest, [[strong]] and well knit; my face is not puffed,
but full, and my [[complexion]] betwixt jovial and melancholic, moderately
sanguine and hot,

          “unde rigent setis mihi crura, et pectora villis;”

          [“whence ‘tis my legs and breast bristle with hair.”
           --martial, ii. 36, 5.]

my health vigorous and sprightly, even to a well advanced [[age]], and rarely
troubled with sickness.  such i was, for i do not now make any account of
myself, now that i am engaged in the avenues of old [[age]], being already
past forty:

              “minutatim vires et robur adultum
               frangit, et in partem pejorem liquitur aetas:”

     [“time by degrees [[degree]] breaks our [[strength]] and makes us grow feeble.
     --“lucretius, ii.  1131.]

what shall be from this [[time]] forward, will be but a half-being, and no
more me: i every day escape and steal away from myself:

               “singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes.”

          [“of the fleeting years each steals something from me.”
           --horace, ep., ii. 2.]

agility and address i never had, and yet am the [[son]] of a very active and
sprightly [[father]], who continued to be so to an extreme old [[age]].  i have
scarce known any [[man]] of his condition, his [[equal]] in all bodily exercises,
as i have seldom met with any who have not excelled me, except in
running, at which i was pretty [[good]].  in [[music]] or singing, for which i
have a very unfit voice, or to play on any sort of instrument, they could
never [[teach]] me anything.  in dancing, tennis, or wrestling, i could never
arrive to more than an ordinary pitch; in swimming, fencing, vaulting,
and leaping, to none at all.  my hands are so clumsy that i cannot even
write so as to [[read]] it myself, so that i had rather do what i have
scribbled over again, than take upon me the trouble to make it out.  i do
not [[read]] much [[better]] than i write, and [[feel]] that i weary my auditors
otherwise (i am) not a [[bad]] clerk.  i cannot decently fold up a letter,
nor could ever make a pen, or carve at table worth a pin, nor saddle a
horse, nor carry a hawk and fly her, nor hunt the dogs, nor lure a hawk,
nor speak to a horse.  in fine, my bodily qualities are very well suited
to those of my [[soul]]; there is nothing sprightly, only a full and firm
vigour: i am patient enough of [[labour]] and pains [[pain]], but it is only when i go
voluntary to [[work]], and only so long as my own [[desire]] prompts me to it:

          “molliter austerum studio fallente laborem.”

          [“study softly beguiling severe [[labour]].”
           --horace, sat., ii. 2, 12.]

otherwise, if i am not allured with some [[pleasure]], or have other guide
than my own pure and [[free]] inclination, i am [[good]] for nothing: for i am of
a [[humour]] that, [[life]] and health excepted, there is nothing for which i
will bite my nails, and that i will purchase at the price of torment of
mind and constraint:

                         “tanti mihi non sit opaci
          omnis arena tagi, quodque in mare volvitur aurum.”

     [“i would not buy [[rich]] tagus sands so dear, nor all the gold that
     lies [[lie]] in the sea.”--juvenal, sat., iii. 54.]

extremely idle, extremely given up to my own inclination both by nature
and art [[arts]], i would as willingly lend a [[man]] my [[blood]] as my pains [[pain]].  i have a
soul [[free]] and entirely its own, and accustomed to guide itself after its
own [[fashion]]; having hitherto never had either master or governor imposed
upon me: i have walked as far as i would, and at the pace that best
pleased myself; this is it that has rendered me unfit for the service of
others, and has made me of no use to any one but myself.

nor was there any need of forcing my heavy and lazy disposition; for
being born to such a [[fortune]] as i had [[reason]] to be contented with (a
reason, nevertheless, that a thousand others of my acquaintance would
have rather made use of for a plank upon which to pass over in search of
higher [[fortune]], to tumult and disquiet), and with as much [[intelligence]] as
i required, i sought for no more, and also got no more:

              “non agimur tumidis velis aquilone secundo,
               non tamen adversis aetatem ducimus austris
               viribus, ingenio, specie, virtute, loco, re,
               extremi primorum, extremis usque priores.”

     [“the northern wind does not agitate our sails; nor auster trouble
     our course with storms.  in [[strength]], talent, figure, [[virtue]],
     [[honour]], [[wealth]], we are short of the foremost, but before the [[last]].”
      --horace, ep., ii. 2, 201.]

i had only need of what was sufficient to content me: which nevertheless
is a [[government]] of [[soul]], to take it [[right]], equally difficult in all sorts
of conditions, and that, of custom, we see more easily found in want than
in abundance: forasmuch, peradventure, as according to the course of our
other [[passions]], the [[desire]] of riches [[rich]] is more sharpened by their use than
by the need of them: and the [[virtue]] of moderation more rare than that of
patience; and i never had anything to [[desire]], but happily to enjoy the
estate that [[god]] by his bounty had put into my hands.  i have never known
anything of trouble, and have had little to do in anything but the
management of my own affairs: or, if i have, it has been upon condition
to do it at my own leisure and after my own method; committed to my trust
by such as had a confidence in me, who did not importune me, and who knew
my [[humour]]; for [[good]] horsemen will make shift to get service out of a
rusty and broken-winded jade.

even my infancy was trained up after a gentle and [[free]] manner, and exempt
from any rigorous subjection.  all this has helped me to a complexion
delicate and incapable of solicitude, even to that [[degree]] that i [[love]] to
have my losses and the disorders wherein i am concerned, concealed from
me.  in the account of my expenses, i put down what my negligence costs
me in feeding and maintaining it;

                              “haec nempe supersunt,
               quae dominum fallunt, quae prosunt furibus.”

               [“that overplus, which the owner knows [[know]] not of,
               but which benefits the thieves”--horace, ep., i. 645]

i [[love]] not to [[know]] what i have, that i may be less sensible of my loss;
i entreat those who serve me, where affection and integrity are absent,
to [[deceive]] me with something like a decent appearance.  for want of
constancy enough to support the shock of adverse accidents to which we
are [[subject]], and of patience seriously to apply myself to the management
of my affairs, i nourish as much as i can this in myself, wholly leaving
all to [[fortune]] “to take all things at the worst, and to resolve to bear
that worst with temper and patience”; that is the only thing i aim at,
and to which i apply my whole meditation.  in a danger, i do not so much
consider how i shall escape it, as of how little importance it is,
whether i escape it or no: should i be left [[dead]] upon the place, what
matter?  not being able to govern events, i govern myself, and apply
myself to them, if they will not apply themselves to me.  i have no great
art to evade, escape from or [[force]] [[fortune]], and by prudence to guide and
incline things to my own bias.  i have still less patience to undergo the
troublesome and painful [[care]] therein required; and the most uneasy
condition for me is to be suspended on urgent occasions [[occasion]], and to be
agitated betwixt [[hope]] and [[fear]].

deliberation, even in things of lightest moment, is very troublesome to
me; and i find my [[mind]] more put to it to undergo the various tumblings
and tossings of [[doubt]] and consultation, than to set up its rest and to
acquiesce in whatever shall happen after the [[die]] is thrown.  few passions
break my sleep, but of deliberations, the least will do it.  as in roads,
i preferably avoid those that are sloping and slippery, and put myself
into the beaten track how dirty or deep soever, where i can fall no
lower, and there seek my safety: so i [[love]] misfortunes that are purely
so, that do not torment and tease me with the uncertainty of their
growing [[better]]; but that at the first push plunge me directly into the
worst that can be expected

                    “dubia plus torquent mala.”

               [“doubtful ills plague us worst.”
                --seneca, [[agamemnon]], iii. 1, 29.]


in events i carry myself like a [[man]]; in conduct, like a child.  the fear
of the fall more fevers me than the fall itself.  the game is not worth
the candle.  the covetous [[man]] fares worse with his passion than the [[poor]],
and the [[jealous]] [[man]] than the cuckold; and a [[man]] ofttimes loses more by
defending his vineyard than if he gave it up.  the lowest walk is the
safest; ‘tis the seat of constancy; you have there need of no one but
yourself; ‘tis there founded and wholly stands upon its own basis.  has
not this [[example]] of a gentleman very well known, some air of philosophy
in it?  he [[married]], being well advanced in years, having spent his youth
in [[good]] fellowship, a [[great]] talker and a [[great]] jeerer, calling to mind
how much the [[subject]] of cuckoldry had given him [[occasion]] to talk and
scoff at others.  to prevent them from paying him in his own coin, he
married a [[wife]] from a place where any one finds what he wants for his
money: “good morrow, strumpet”; “good morrow, cuckold”; and there was not
anything wherewith he more commonly and openly entertained those who came
to see him than with this design of his, by which he stopped the private
chattering of mockers, and blunted all the point from this reproach.

as to [[ambition]], which is neighbour, or rather [[daughter]], to presumption,
fortune, to advance me, must have come and taken me by the hand; for to
trouble myself for an uncertain [[hope]], and to have submitted myself to all
the difficulties that accompany those who endeavour to bring themselves
into credit in the beginning of their [[progress]], i could never have done
it:

                         “spem pretio non emo.”

               [“i will not purchase [[hope]] with ready [[money]],” (or),
               “i do not purchase [[hope]] at a price.”
                --terence, adelphi, ii. 3, 11.]

i apply myself to what i see and to what i have in my hand, and go not
very far from the shore,

               “alter remus aquas, alter tibi radat arenas:”

     [“one oar plunging into the sea, the other raking the sands.”
      --propertius, iii.  3, 23.]

and besides, a [[man]] rarely arrives at these advancements but in first
hazarding what he has of his own; and i am of [[opinion]] that if a [[man]] have
sufficient to maintain him in the condition wherein he was born and
brought up, ‘tis a [[great]] folly to hazard that upon the uncertainty of
augmenting it.  he to whom [[fortune]] has denied whereon to set his foot,
and to settle a quiet and composed way of living, is to be excused if he
venture what he has, because, happen what will, necessity puts him upon
shifting for himself:

               “capienda rebus in malis praeceps via est:”

          [“a course is to be taken in [[bad]] cases.” (or),
          “a desperate case must have a desperate course.”
           ---seneca, [[agamemnon]], ii. 1, 47.]

and i rather excuse a younger [[brother]] for exposing what his [[friends]] have
left him to the courtesy of [[fortune]], than him with whom the [[honour]] of his
family is entrusted, who cannot be necessitous but by his own [[fault]].
i have found a much shorter and more easy way, by the [[advice]] of the good
friends i had in my younger days, to [[free]] myself from any such [[ambition]],
and to sit still:

          “cui sit conditio dulcis sine pulvere palmae:”

     [“what condition can compare with that where one has gained the
     palm without the dust of the course.”--horace,  ep., i. i, 51.]

judging rightly enough of my own [[strength]], that it was not capable of any
great matters; and calling to [[mind]] the saying of the late chancellor
olivier, that the french were like monkeys that swarm up a tree from
branch to branch, and never stop till they come to the highest, and there
shew their breech.

          “turpe est, quod nequeas, capiti committere pondus,
          et pressum inflexo mox dare terga genu.”

     [“it is a shame to load the head so that it cannot bear the
     burthen, and the knees give way.”--propertius, iii. 9, 5.]

i should find the [[best]] qualities i have useless in this [[age]]; the facility
of my manners would have been called weakness and negligence; my faith
and [[conscience]], scrupulosity and superstition; my [[liberty]] and freedom
would have been reputed troublesome, inconsiderate, and rash.  ill luck
is [[good]] for something.  it is [[good]] to be born in a very depraved [[age]]; for
so, in comparison of others, you shall be reputed [[virtuous]] [[good]] cheap; he
who in our days is but a parricide and a sacrilegious [[person]] is an honest
man and a [[man]] of [[honour]]:

              “nunc, si depositum non inficiatur amicus,
               si reddat veterem cum tota aerugine follem,
               prodigiosa fides, et tuscis digna libellis,
               quaeque coronata lustrari debeat agna:”

     [“now, if a friend does not deny his trust, but restores the old
     purse with all its rust; ‘tis a prodigious [[faith]], worthy to be
     enrolled in amongst the tuscan annals, and a crowned lamb should be
     sacrificed to such exemplary integrity.”--juvenal, sat., xiii. 611.]

and never was [[time]] or place wherein princes [[prince]] might propose to themselves
more assured or greater rewards [[reward]] for [[virtue]] and [[justice]].  the first who
shall make it his [[business]] to get himself into favour and esteem by those
ways, i am much deceived if he do not and by the [[best]] title outstrip his
competitors: [[force]] and [[violence]] can do something, but not always all.
we see merchants, [[country]] justices, and artisans go cheek by jowl with
the [[best]] gentry in valour and [[military]] [[knowledge]]: they perform honourable
actions, both in [[public]] engagements and private quarrels; they fight
duels, they defend towns in our [[present]] wars [[war]]; a [[prince]] stifles his
special recommendation, renown, in this crowd; let him shine bright in
humanity, [[truth]], loyalty, temperance, and especially [[injustice]]; marks
rare, unknown, and exiled; ‘tis by no other means but by the sole
goodwill of the [[people]] that he can do his [[business]]; and no other
qualities can attract their goodwill like those, as being of the greatest
utility to them:

               “nil est tam populare, quam bonitas.”

     [“nothing is so popular as an agreeable manner (goodness).”
      --cicero, pro ligar., c. 12.]

by this standard i had been [[great]] and rare, just as i find myself now
pigmy and vulgar by the standard of some [[past]] ages [[age]], wherein, if no other
better qualities concurred, it was ordinary and [[common]] to see a man
moderate in his revenges, gentle in resenting injuries, [[religious]] of his
word, neither double nor supple, nor accommodating his [[faith]] to the will
of others, or the turns of the times [[time]]: i would rather see all affairs go
to wreck and ruin than falsify my [[faith]] to secure them.  for as to this
new [[virtue]] of feigning and dissimulation, which is now in so great
credit, i mortally hate it; and of all vices [[vice]] find none that evidences so
much baseness and meanness of spirit.  ‘tis a cowardly and servile humour
to hide and [[disguise]] a man’s [[self]] under a visor, and not to dare to show
himself what he is; ‘tis by this our servants are trained up to
treachery; being brought up to speak what is not true, they make no
conscience of a [[lie]].  a generous [[heart]] ought not to belie its own
thoughts; it will make itself seen within; all there is [[good]], or at least
human.  [[aristotle]]  reputes it the office of magnanimity openly and
professedly to [[love]] and hate; to [[judge]] and speak with all [[freedom]]; and
not to value the approbation or dislike of others in comparison of [[truth]].
apollonius said it was for slaves [[slave]] to [[lie]], and for freemen to speak [[truth]]:
‘tis the [[chief]] and fundamental part of [[virtue]]; we must [[love]] it for
itself.  he who speaks [[truth]] because he is obliged so to do, and because
it serves him, and who is not afraid to [[lie]] when it signifies nothing to
anybody, is not sufficiently true.  my [[soul]] naturally abominates lying,
and hates the very [[thought]] of it.  i have an inward shame and a sharp
remorse, if sometimes a [[lie]] escapes me: as sometimes it does, being
surprised by occasions [[occasion]] that allow me no premeditation.  a [[man]] must not
always tell all, for that were folly: but what a [[man]] says should be what
he thinks [[think]], otherwise ‘tis knavery.  i do not [[know]] what advantage men
pretend to by eternally counterfeiting and dissembling, if not never to
be believed when they speak the [[truth]]; it may once or twice pass with
men; but to profess the concealing their [[thought]], and to brag, as some of
our princes [[prince]] have done, that they would burn their shirts if they knew
their true intentions, which was a saying of the ancient metellius of
macedon; and that they who [[know]] not how to dissemble [[know]] not how to
rule, is to give warning to all who have anything to do with them, that
all they say is nothing but lying and deceit:

          “quo quis versutior et callidior est, hoc invisior et
          suspectior, detracto opinione probitatis:”

     [“by how much any one is more subtle and cunning, by so much is he
     hated and suspected, the [[opinion]] of his integrity being withdrawn.”
      --cicero, de off., ii. 9.]

it were a [[great]] simplicity in any one to lay any stress either on the
countenance or word of a [[man]] who has put on a resolution to be always
another thing without than he is within, as tiberius did; and i cannot
conceive what part such persons [[person]] can have in conversation with [[men]], seeing
they [[produce]] nothing that is received as true: whoever is disloyal to
truth is the same to falsehood also.

those of our [[time]] who have considered in the establishment of the [[duty]] of
a [[prince]] the [[good]] of his affairs only, and have preferred that to the
care of his [[faith]] and [[conscience]], might have something to say to a prince
whose affairs [[fortune]] had put into such a posture that he might for ever
establish them by only once breaking his word: but it will not go so;
they often buy in the same market; they make more than one [[peace]] and
enter into more than one treaty in their lives [[life]].  gain tempts to the first
breach of [[faith]], and almost always presents [[present]] itself, as in all other ill
acts, sacrileges, murders, rebellions, treasons, as being undertaken for
some [[kind]] of advantage; but this first gain has infinite mischievous
consequences, throwing this [[prince]] out of all correspondence and
negotiation, by this [[example]] of infidelity.  soliman, of the ottoman
race, a [[race]] not very solicitous of keeping their words or compacts,
when, in my infancy, he made his [[army]] [[land]] at otranto, being informed
that mercurino de’ gratinare and the inhabitants of castro were detained
prisoners, after having surrendered the place, contrary to the articles
of their capitulation, sent orders to have them set at [[liberty]], saying,
that having other [[great]] enterprises in hand in those parts, the
disloyalty, though it carried a show of [[present]] utility, would for the
future bring on him a disrepute and distrust of infinite prejudice.

now, for my part, i had rather be troublesome and indiscreet than a
flatterer and a dissembler.  i confess that there may be some mixture of
pride and obstinacy in keeping myself so upright and open as i do,
without any consideration of others; and methinks i am a little too [[free]],
where i ought least to be so, and that i grow hot by the opposition of
respect; and it may be also, that i suffer myself to [[follow]] the
propension of my own [[nature]] for want of art [[arts]]; using the same [[liberty]],
speech, and countenance towards [[great]] persons [[person]], that i bring with me from
my own house: i am sensible how much it declines towards incivility and
indiscretion but, besides that i am so bred, i have not a wit supple
enough to evade a sudden [[question]], and to escape by some evasion, nor to
feign a [[truth]], nor memory enough to retain it so feigned; nor, truly,
assurance enough to maintain it, and so play the brave out of weakness.
and therefore it is that i abandon myself to candour, always to speak as
i [[think]], both by [[complexion]] and design, leaving the event to [[fortune]].
aristippus was wont to say, that the principal benefit he had extracted
from [[philosophy]] was that he spoke freely and openly to all.

memory is a faculty of wonderful use, and without which the [[judgment]] can
very hardly perform its office: for my part i have none at all.  what any
one will propound to me, he must do it piecemeal, for to [[answer]] a speech
consisting of several heads i am not able.  i could not receive a
commission by word of mouth without a note-book.  and when i have a
speech of consequence to make, if it be long, i am reduced to the
miserable necessity of getting by [[heart]] word for word, what i am to say;
i should otherwise have neither method nor assurance, being in [[fear]] that
my memory would play me a slippery trick.  but this way is no less
difficult to me than the other; i must have three hours to learn three
verses.  and besides, in a [[work]] of a man’s own, the [[liberty]] and authority
of altering the order, of changing a word, incessantly varying the
matter, makes it harder to stick in the memory of the author.  the more
i mistrust it the worse it is; it serves me [[best]] by [[chance]]; i must
solicit it negligently; for if i press it, ‘tis confused, and after it
once begins to stagger, the more i sound it, the more it is perplexed;
it serves me at its own hour, not at mine.

and the same defect i find in my memory, i find also in several other
parts.  i fly command, obligation, and constraint; that which i can
otherwise naturally and easily do, if i impose it upon myself by an
express and strict injunction, i cannot do it.  even the members of my
body, which have a more particular jurisdiction of their own, sometimes
refuse to obey me, if i enjoin them a necessary service at a certain
hour.  this [[tyrannical]] and compulsive appointment baffles them; they
shrink up either through [[fear]] or spite, and fall into a trance.  being
once in a place where it is looked upon as barbarous discourtesy not to
pledge those who drink to you, though i had there all [[liberty]] allowed me,
i tried to play the [[good]] fellow, out of [[respect]] to the ladies [[lady]] who were
there, according to the custom of the [[country]]; but there was [[sport]] enough
for this pressure and preparation, to [[force]] myself contrary to my custom
and inclination, so stopped my throat that i could not swallow one drop,
and was deprived of drinking so much as with my meat; i found myself
gorged, and my, thirst quenched by the quantity of drink that my
imagination had swallowed.  this effect is most manifest in such as have
the most vehement and powerful [[imagination]]: but it is [[natural]],
notwithstanding, and there is no one who does not in some measure feel
it.  they offered an excellent archer, condemned to [[die]], to save his
life, if he would show some notable proof of his art [[arts]], but he refused to
try, fearing lest the too [[great]] contention of his will should make him
shoot wide, and that instead of saving his [[life]], he should also lose the
reputation he had got of being a [[good]] marksman.  a [[man]] who thinks [[think]] of
something else, will not fail to take over and over again the same number
and measure of steps, even to an inch, in the place where he walks; but
if he made it his [[business]] to measure and count them, he will find that
what he did by [[nature]] and accident, he cannot so exactly do by design.

my library, which is a fine one among those of the village type, is
situated in a corner of my house; if anything comes into my head that i
have a [[mind]] to search or to write, lest i should forget it in but going
across the court, i am fain to commit it to the memory of some other.
if i venture in speaking to digress never so little from my [[subject]], i am
infallibly lost, which is the [[reason]] that i keep myself, in discourse,
strictly close.  i am forced to call the [[men]] who serve me either by the
names of their offices or their [[country]]; for names are very hard for me
to [[remember]].  i can tell indeed that there are three syllables, that it
has a harsh sound, and that it begins or ends with such a letter; but
that’s all; and if i should [[live]] long, i do not [[doubt]] but i should forget
my own name, as some others have done.  messala corvinus was two years
without any trace of memory, which is also said of georgius trapezuntius.
for my own interest, i often meditate what a [[kind]] of [[life]] theirs was, and
if, without this faculty, i should have enough left to support me with
any manner of ease; and prying narrowly into it, i [[fear]] that this
privation, if absolute, destroys all the other functions of the [[soul]]:

          “plenus rimarum sum, hac atque iliac perfluo.”

          [“i’m full of chinks, and leak out every way.”
           --ter., eunuchus, ii. 2, 23.]

it has befallen me more than once to forget the watchword i had three
hours before given or received, and to forget where i had hidden my
purse; whatever cicero is pleased to say, i [[help]] myself to lose what i
have a particular [[care]] to lock safe up:

          “memoria certe non modo philosophiam sed omnis
          vitae usum, omnesque artes, una maxime continet.”

     [“it is [[certain]] that memory contains not only [[philosophy]],
     but all the [[arts]] and all that appertain to the use of [[life]].”
      --cicero, acad., ii. 7.]

memory is the receptacle and case of [[science]]: and therefore mine being so
treacherous, if i [[know]] little, i cannot much [[complain]].  i [[know]], in
general, the names of the [[arts]], and of what they treat, but nothing more.
i turn over books [[book]]; i do not study them.  what i retain i no longer
recognise as another’s; ‘tis only what my [[judgment]] has made its advantage
of, the discourses and imaginations [[imagination]] in which it has been instructed: the
author, place, words, and other circumstances, i immediately forget; and
i am so excellent at forgetting, that i no less forget my own writings
and compositions than the rest.  i am very often quoted to myself, and am
not aware of it.  whoever should inquire of me where i had the verses and
examples, that i have here huddled together, would puzzle me to tell him,
and yet i have not borrowed them but from famous and known authors, not
contenting myself that they were [[rich]], if i, moreover, had them not from
rich and honourable hands, where there is a concurrence of [[authority]] with
reason.  it is no [[great]] wonder if my [[book]] run the same [[fortune]] that other
books do, if my memory lose what i have written as well as what i have
read, and what i give, as well as what i receive.

besides the defect of memory, i have others which very much contribute to
my ignorance; i have a slow and heavy wit, the least cloud stops its
progress, so that, for [[example]], i never propose to it any never so easy a
riddle that it could find out; there is not the least idle subtlety that
will not gravel me; in games, where wit is required, as chess, draughts,
and the like, i [[understand]] no more than the [[common]] movements.  i have a
slow and perplexed apprehension, but what it once apprehends, it
apprehends well, for the [[time]] it retains it.  my sight is [[perfect]],
entire, and discovers at a very [[great]] distance, but is soon weary and
heavy at [[work]], which occasions [[occasion]] that i cannot [[read]] long, but am forced to
have one to [[read]] to me.  the younger pliny  can inform such as have not
experimented it themselves, how important an impediment this is to those
who devote themselves to this employment.

there is no so wretched and coarse a [[soul]], wherein some particular
faculty is not seen to shine; no [[soul]] so buried in sloth and ignorance,
but it will sally at one end or another; and how it comes to pass that a
man blind and asleep to everything else, shall be found sprightly, clear,
and excellent in some one particular effect, we are to inquire of our
masters: but the beautiful souls [[soul]] are they that are universal, open, and
ready for all things; if not instructed, at least capable of being so;
which i say to accuse my own; for whether it be through infirmity or
negligence (and to neglect that which lies [[lie]] at our feet, which we have in
our hands, and what nearest concerns the use of [[life]], is far from my
doctrine) there is not a [[soul]] in the [[world]] so awkward as mine, and so
ignorant of many [[common]] things, and such as a [[man]] cannot without shame
fail to [[know]].  i must give some examples [[example]].

i was born and bred up in the [[country]], and amongst husbandmen; i have had
business and husbandry in my own hands ever since my predecessors, who
were lords [[lord]] of the estate i now enjoy, left me to succeed them; and yet i
can neither cast accounts, nor reckon my counters: most of our current
money i do not [[know]], nor the difference betwixt one grain and another,
either growing or in the barn, if it be not too apparent, and scarcely
can distinguish between the cabbage and lettuce in my garden.  i do not
so much as [[understand]] the names of the [[chief]] instruments of husbandry,
nor the most ordinary elements of agriculture, which the very children
know: much less the mechanic [[arts]], traffic, merchandise, the variety and
nature of fruits, wines, and viands, nor how to make a hawk fly, nor to
physic a horse or a dog.  and, since i must publish my whole shame, ‘tis
not above a month ago, that i was trapped in my ignorance of the use of
leaven to make bread, or to what end it was to keep wine in the vat.
they conjectured of old at [[athens]],  an aptitude for the mathematics in
him they saw ingeniously bavin up a burthen of brushwood.  in earnest,
they would draw a quite contrary conclusion from me, for give me the
whole provision and necessaries of a kitchen, i should starve.  by these
features of my [[confession]] [[men]] may imagine others to my prejudice: but
whatever i deliver myself to be, provided it be such as i really am,
i have my end; neither will i make any excuse for committing to paper
such mean and frivolous things as these: the meanness of the subject
compells me to it.  they may, if they please, accuse my project, but not
my [[progress]]: so it is, that without anybody’s needing to tell me, i
sufficiently see of how little weight and value all this is, and the
folly of my design: ‘tis enough that my [[judgment]] does not contradict
itself, of which these are the essays.

              “nasutus sis usque licet, sis denique nasus,
               quantum noluerit ferre rogatus atlas;
               et possis ipsum to deridere latinum,
               non potes in nugas dicere plura mess,
               ipse ego quam dixi: quid dentem dente juvabit
               rodere?  carne opus est, si satur esse velis.
               ne perdas operam; qui se mirantur, in illos
               virus habe; nos haec novimus esse nihil.”

     [“let your nose be as keen as it will, be all nose, and even a nose
     so [[great]] that atlas will refuse to bear it: if [[asked]], could you even
     excel latinus in scoffing; against my trifles you could say no more
     than i myself have said: then to what end contend tooth against
     tooth?  you must have flesh, if you want to be full; lose not your
     [[labour]] then; cast your venom upon those that [[admire]] themselves; i
     [[know]] already that these things are worthless.”--mart., xiii. 2.]

i am not obliged not to utter absurdities, provided i am not deceived in
them and [[know]] them to be such: and to trip knowingly, is so ordinary with
me, that i seldom do it otherwise, and rarely trip by [[chance]].  ‘tis no
great matter to add ridiculous actions to the temerity of my [[humour]],
since i cannot ordinarily [[help]] supplying it with those that are vicious.

i was [[present]] one day at barleduc,  when [[king]] francis ii., for a memorial
of rene, [[king]] of sicily, was presented with a portrait he had drawn of
himself: why is it not in like manner lawful for every one to draw
himself with a pen, as he did with a crayon?  i will not, therefore, omit
this blemish though very unfit to be published, which is irresolution; a
very [[great]] effect and very incommodious in the negotiations of the
affairs of the [[world]]; in doubtful enterprises, i [[know]] not which to
choose:

               “ne si, ne no, nel cor mi suona intero.”

     [“my [[heart]] does not tell me either yes or no.”--petrarch.]

i can maintain an [[opinion]], but i cannot choose one.  by [[reason]] that in
human things, to what sect soever we incline, many appearances present
themselves that confirm us in it; and the philosopher chrysippus said,
that he would of zeno and cleanthes, his masters, learn their doctrines
only; for, as to proofs and reasons [[reason]], he should find enough of his own.
which way soever i turn, i still furnish myself with causes, and
likelihood enough to fix me there; which makes me detain [[doubt]] and the
liberty of choosing, till [[occasion]] presses; and then, to confess the
truth, i, for the most part, throw the feather into the wind, as the
saying is, and commit myself to the [[mercy]] of [[fortune]]; a very light
inclination and circumstance carries me along with it.

         “dum in dubio est animus, paulo momento huc atque
          illuc impellitur.”

     [“while the [[mind]] is in [[doubt]], in a short [[time]] it is impelled this
     way and that.”--terence, andr., i. 6, 32.]

the uncertainty of my [[judgment]] is so equally balanced in most
occurrences, that i could willingly refer it to be decided by the chance
of a [[die]]: and i observe, with [[great]] consideration of our [[human]] infirmity,
the examples [[example]] that the [[divine]] [[history]] itself has left us of this custom of
referring to [[fortune]] and [[chance]] the determination of election in doubtful
things:

                    “sors cecidit super matthiam.”

               [“the lot fell upon matthew.”--acts i. 26.]

human [[reason]] is a two-edged and dangerous [[sword]]: observe in the hands of
socrates, her most intimate and familiar friend, how many several points
it has.  i am thus [[good]] for nothing but to [[follow]] and suffer myself to be
easily carried away with the crowd; i have not confidence enough in my
own [[strength]] to take upon me to command and lead; i am very glad to find
the way beaten before me by others.  if i must run the hazard of an
uncertain [[choice]], i am rather willing to have it under such a one as is
more confident in his opinions [[opinion]] than i am in mine, whose ground and
foundation i find to be very slippery and unsure.

yet i do not easily [[change]], by [[reason]] that i discern the same weakness in
contrary opinions [[opinion]]:

               “ipsa consuetudo assentiendi periculosa
               esse videtur, et lubrica;”

          [“the very custom of assenting seems to be dangerous
          and slippery.”--cicero, acad., ii. 21.]

especially in [[political]] affairs, there is a large field open for changes
and contestation:

         “justa pari premitur veluti cum pondere libra,
          prona, nec hac plus pane sedet, nec surgit ab illa.”

     [“as a just balance, pressed with [[equal]] weight, neither dips
     nor rises on either side.”--tibullus, iv. 41.]

machiavelli’s writings, for [[example]], were solid enough for the [[subject]],
yet were they easy enough to be controverted; and they who have done so,
have left as [[great]] a facility of controverting theirs; there was never
wanting in that [[kind]] of argument replies and replies upon replies, and as
infinite a contexture of debates as our wrangling lawyers have extended
in favour of long suits:

          “caedimur et totidem plagis consumimus hostem;”

     [“we are slain, and with as many blows kill the enemy” (or),
     “it is a [[fight]] wherein we exhaust each other by mutual wounds.”
      --horace, epist., ii. 2, 97.]

the reasons [[reason]] have little other foundation than [[experience]], and the variety
of [[human]] events presenting us with infinite examples [[example]] of all sorts of
forms.  an understanding [[person]] of our times [[time]] says: that whoever would, in
contradiction to our almanacs, write cold where they say hot, and wet
where they say dry, and always put the contrary to what they foretell; if
he were to lay a wager, he would not [[care]] which side he took, excepting
where no uncertainty could fall out, as to promise excessive heats at
christmas, or extremity of cold at midsummer.  i have the same [[opinion]] of
these [[political]] controversies; be on which side you will, you have as
fair a game to play as your adversary, provided you do not proceed so far
as to shock principles [[principle]] that are broad and manifest.  and yet, in my
conceit, in [[public]] affairs, there is no [[government]] so ill, provided it be
ancient and has been constant, that is not [[better]] than [[change]] and
alteration.

our manners are infinitely [[corrupt]], and wonderfully incline to the worse;
of our laws [[law]] and customs there are many that are barbarous and monstrous
nevertheless, by [[reason]] of the difficulty of reformation, and the danger
of stirring things, if i could put something under to stop the wheel, and
keep it where it is, i would do it with all my [[heart]]:

              “numquam adeo foedis, adeoque pudendis
               utimur exemplis, ut non pejora supersint.”

          [“the examples [[example]] we use are not so shameful and foul
          but that worse remain behind.”--juvenal, viii. 183.]

the worst thing i find in our [[state]] is instability, and that our laws [[law]],
no more than our clothes, cannot settle in any [[certain]] form.  it is very
easy to accuse a [[government]] of imperfection, for all mortal things are
full of it: it is very easy to beget in a [[people]] a contempt of ancient
observances; never any [[man]] undertook it but he did it; but to establish a
better regimen in the stead of that which a [[man]] has overthrown, many who
have attempted it have foundered.  i very little consult my prudence in
my conduct; i am willing to let it be guided by the [[public]] [[rule]].  happy
the [[people]] who do what they are commanded, [[better]] than they who command,
without tormenting themselves as to the causes; who suffer themselves
gently to roll after the celestial revolution!  [[obedience]] is never pure
nor calm in him who reasons [[reason]] and disputes.

in fine, to return to myself: the only thing by which i something esteem
myself, is that wherein never any [[man]] [[thought]] himself to be defective; my
recommendation is vulgar, [[common]], and popular; for who ever [[thought]] he
wanted sense?  it would be a proposition that would imply a contradiction
in itself; ‘tis a disease that never is where it is discerned; ‘tis
tenacious and [[strong]], but what the first ray of the patient’s sight
nevertheless pierces through and disperses, as the beams of the sun do
thick and obscure mists; to accuse one’s [[self]] would be to excuse in this
case, and to condemn, to absolve.  there never was porter or the silliest
girl, that did not [[think]] they had sense enough to do their [[business]].
we easily enough confess in others an advantage of [[courage]], [[strength]],
experience, activity, and [[beauty]], but an advantage in [[judgment]] we yield
to none; and the reasons [[reason]] that proceed simply from the [[natural]] conclusions
of others, we [[think]], if we had but turned our thoughts [[thought]] that way, we
should ourselves have found out as well as they.  [[knowledge]], style, and
such parts as we see in others’ works [[work]], we are soon aware of, if they
excel our own: but for the simple products of the understanding, every
one thinks [[think]] he could have found out the like in himself, and is hardly
sensible of the weight and difficulty, if not (and then with much ado) in
an extreme and incomparable distance.  and whoever should be able clearly
to discern the height of another’s [[judgment]], would be also able to raise
his own to the same pitch.  so that it is a sort of exercise, from which
a [[man]] is to expect very little [[praise]]; a [[kind]] of composition of small
repute.  and, besides, for whom do you write?  the learned, to whom the
authority appertains of judging books [[book]], [[know]] no other value but that of
learning, and allow of no other proceeding of wit but that of erudition
and art [[arts]]: if you have mistaken one of the scipios for another, what is all
the rest you have to say worth?  whoever is ignorant of [[aristotle]],
according to their [[rule]], is in some sort ignorant of himself; vulgar
souls cannot discern the grace and [[force]] of a lofty and delicate style.
now these two sorts of [[men]] take up the [[world]].  the third sort into whose
hands you fall, of souls [[soul]] that are regular and [[strong]] of themselves, is so
rare, that it justly has neither name nor place amongst us; and ‘tis so
much [[time]] lost to aspire unto it, or to endeavour to please it.

‘tis commonly said that the justest portion [[nature]] has given us of her
favours is that of sense; for there is no one who is not contented with
his share: is it not [[reason]]? whoever should see beyond that, would see
beyond his sight.  i [[think]] my opinions [[opinion]] are [[good]] and sound, but who does
not [[think]] the same of his own?  one of the [[best]] proofs i have that mine
are so is the small esteem i have of myself; for had they not been very
well assured, they would easily have [[suffered]] themselves to have been
deceived by the peculiar affection i have to myself, as one that places
it almost wholly in myself, and do not let much run out.  all that others
distribute amongst an infinite number of [[friends]] and acquaintance, to
their [[glory]] and grandeur, i dedicate to the repose of my own [[mind]] and to
myself; that which escapes thence is not properly by my direction:

               “mihi nempe valere et vivere doctus.”

               [“to [[live]] and to do well for myself.”
                --lucretius, v. 959.]

now i find my opinions [[opinion]] very bold and constant in condemning my own
imperfection.  and, to say the [[truth]], ‘tis a [[subject]] upon which i
exercise my [[judgment]] as much as upon any other.  the [[world]] looks always
opposite; i turn my sight inwards, and there fix and employ it.  i have
no other [[business]] but myself, i am eternally meditating upon myself,
considering and tasting myself.  other [[men’s]] thoughts [[thought]] are ever wandering
abroad, if they will but see it; they are still going forward:

               “nemo in sese tentat descendere;”

          [“no one thinks [[think]] of descending into himself.”
           --persius, iv. 23.]

for my part, i circulate in myself.  this capacity of trying the [[truth]],
whatever it be, in myself, and this [[free]] [[humour]] of not over easily
subjecting my [[belief]], i owe principally to myself; for the strongest and
most general imaginations [[imagination]] i have are those that, as a [[man]] may say, were
born with me; they are [[natural]] and entirely my own.  i produced them
crude and simple, with a [[strong]] and bold production, but a little
troubled and imperfect; i have since established and fortified them with
the [[authority]] of others and the sound examples [[example]] of the ancients, whom i
have found of the same [[judgment]]: they have given me faster hold, and a
more manifest fruition and possession of that i had before embraced.  the
reputation that every one pretends to of vivacity and promptness of wit,
i seek in regularity; the [[glory]] they pretend to from a striking and
signal action, or some particular excellence, i claim from order,
correspondence, and tranquillity of opinions [[opinion]] and manners:

     “omnino si quidquam est decorum, nihil est profecto magis, quam
     aequabilitas universae vitae, tum singularum actionum, quam
     conservare non possis, si, aliorum naturam imitans, omittas tuam.”

     [“if anything be entirely decorous, nothing certainly can be more so
     than an equability alike in the whole [[life]] and in every particular
     action; which thou canst not possibly observe if, imitating other
     [[men’s]] natures [[nature]], thou layest aside thy own.”--cicero, de of., i. 31.]

here, then, you see to what [[degree]] i find myself guilty of this first
part, that i said was the [[vice]] of presumption.  as to the second, which
consists in not having a sufficient esteem for others, i [[know]] not whether
or no i can so well excuse myself; but whatever comes on’t i am resolved
to speak the [[truth]].  and whether, peradventure, it be that the continual
frequentation i have had with the humours [[humour]] of the ancients, and the idea
of those [[great]] souls [[soul]] of [[past]] ages [[age]], put me out of taste both with others
and myself, or that, in [[truth]], the [[age]] we [[live]] in produces [[produce]] but very
indifferent things, yet so it is that i see nothing worthy of any great
admiration.  neither, indeed, have i so [[great]] an intimacy with many men
as is requisite to make a [[right]] [[judgment]] of them; and those with whom my
condition makes me the most frequent, are, for the most part, [[men]] who
have little [[care]] of the [[culture]] of the [[soul]], but that look upon [[honour]] as
the sum of all blessings, and valour as the height of all [[perfection]].

what i see that is fine in others i very readily commend and esteem: nay,
i often say more in their commendation than i [[think]] they really deserve,
and give myself so far leave to [[lie]], for i cannot invent a false [[subject]]:
my testimony is never wanting to my [[friends]] in what i conceive deserves
praise, and where a foot is due i am willing to give them a foot and a
half; but to attribute to them qualities that they have not, i cannot do
it, nor openly defend their imperfections.  nay, i frankly give my very
enemies their due testimony of [[honour]]; my affection alters, my judgment
does not, and i never confound my animosity with other circumstances that
are [[foreign]] to it; and i am so [[jealous]] of the [[liberty]] of my [[judgment]] that
i can very hardly part with it for any passion whatever.  i do myself a
greater injury in lying than i do him of whom i tell a [[lie]].  this
commendable and generous custom is observed of the persian nation, that
they spoke of their mortal enemies [[enemy]] and with whom they were at deadly [[war]],
as honourably and justly as their virtues [[virtue]] deserved.

i [[know]] [[men]] enough that have several fine parts; one wit, another [[courage]],
another address, another [[conscience]], another [[language]]: one [[science]],
another, another; but a generally [[great]] [[man]], and who has all these brave
parts together, or any one of them to such a [[degree]] of excellence that we
should [[admire]] him or compare him with those we [[honour]] of times [[time]] [[past]], my
fortune never brought me acquainted with; and the [[greatest]] i ever knew, i
mean for the [[natural]] parts of the [[soul]], was etienne de la boetie; his was
a full [[soul]] indeed, and that had every way a beautiful aspect: a [[soul]] of
the old stamp, and that had produced [[great]] effects had his [[fortune]] been
so pleased, having added much to those [[great]] [[natural]] parts by learning
and study.

but how it comes to pass i [[know]] not, and yet it is certainly so, there is
as much vanity and weakness of [[judgment]] in those who profess the greatest
abilities, who take upon them learned callings and bookish employments as
in any other sort of [[men]] whatever; either because more is required and
expected from them, and that [[common]] defects are excusable in them, or
because the [[opinion]] they have of their own learning makes them more bold
to expose and lay themselves too open, by which they lose and betray
themselves.  as an artificer more manifests his want of [[skill]] in a rich
matter he has in hand, if he disgrace the [[work]] by ill handling and
contrary to the rules [[rule]] required, than in a matter of less value; and men
are more displeased at a disproportion in a statue of gold than in one of
plaster; so do these when they advance things that in themselves and in
their place would be [[good]]; for they make use of them without discretion,
honouring their memories at the expense of their understandings, and
making themselves ridiculous by honouring cicero, galen, ulpian, and st.
jerome alike.

i willingly fall again into the discourse of the vanity of our [[education]],
the end of which is not to render us [[good]] and [[wise]], but learned, and she
has obtained it.  she has not taught us to [[follow]] and embrace [[virtue]] and
prudence, but she has imprinted in us their derivation and etymology; we
know how to decline [[virtue]], if we [[know]] not how to [[love]] it; if we do not
know what prudence is really and in effect, and by [[experience]], we have it
however by jargon and [[heart]]: we are not content to [[know]] the extraction,
kindred, and alliances of our neighbours; we [[desire]], moreover, to have
them our [[friends]] and to establish a correspondence and [[intelligence]] with
them; but this [[education]] of ours has taught us definitions, divisions,
and partitions of [[virtue]], as so many surnames and branches of a
genealogy, without any further [[care]] of establishing any familiarity or
intimacy betwixt her and us.  it has culled out for our initiatory
instruction not such books [[book]] as contain the soundest and truest opinions [[opinion]],
but those that speak the [[best]] [[greek]] and latin, and by their fine words
has instilled into our fancy the vainest humours [[humour]] of antiquity.

a [[good]] [[education]] alters the [[judgment]] and manners; as it happened to
polemon, a lewd and debauched [[young]] [[greek]], who going by [[chance]] to hear
one of xenocrates’ lectures, did not only observe the eloquence and
learning of the reader, and not only brought away, the [[knowledge]] of some
fine matter, but a more manifest and more solid [[profit]], which was the
sudden [[change]] and reformation of his former [[life]].  whoever found such an
effect of our discipline?

                              “faciasne, quod olim
               mutatus polemon? ponas insignia morbi
               fasciolas, cubital, focalia; potus ut ille
               dicitur ex collo furtim carpsisse coronas,
               postquam est impransi correptus voce magistri?”

     [“will you do what reformed polemon did of old? will you lay aside
     the joys of your disease, your garters, capuchin, muffler, as he in
     his cups is said to have secretly torn off his garlands from his
     neck when he heard what that temperate teacher said?”
      --horace, sat., ii. 3, 253]

that seems to me to be the least contemptible condition of [[men]], which by
its plainness and simplicity is seated in the lowest [[degree]], and invites
us to a more regular course.  i find the rude manners and [[language]] of
country [[people]] commonly [[better]] suited to the [[rule]] and prescription of
true [[philosophy]], than those of our [[philosophers]] themselves:

     “plus sapit vulgus, quia tantum, quantum opus est, sapit.”

     [“the vulgar are so much the wiser, because they only [[know]] what
     is needful for them to [[know]].”--lactantms, instit. div., iii. 5.]

the most remarkable [[men]], as i have judged by outward appearance (for to
judge of them according to my own method, i must penetrate a [[great]] deal
deeper), for soldiers and [[military]] conduct, were the duc de guise, who
died at orleans, and the late marshal strozzi; and for [[men]] of great
ability and no [[common]] [[virtue]], olivier and de l’hospital, chancellors of
france.  poetry, too, in my [[opinion]], has flourished in this [[age]] of ours;
we have abundance of very [[good]] artificers in the [[trade]]: d’aurat, beza,
buchanan, l’hospital, montdore, turnebus; as to the french poets, i
believe they raised their art [[arts]] to the highest pitch to which it can ever
arrive; and in those parts of it wherein ronsard and du bellay excel, i
find them little inferior to the ancient [[perfection]].  adrian turnebus
knew more, and what he did [[know]], [[better]] than any [[man]] of his [[time]], or long
before him.  the lives [[life]] of the [[last]] duke of alva, and of our constable de
montmorency, were both of them [[great]] and [[noble]], and that had many rare
resemblances of [[fortune]]; but the [[beauty]] and [[glory]] of the [[death]] of the
last, in the sight of [[paris]] and of his [[king]], in their service, against
his nearest relations, at the head of an [[army]] through his conduct
victorious, and by a sudden stroke, in so extreme old [[age]], merits
methinks to be recorded amongst the most remarkable events of our times [[time]].
as also the constant goodness, sweetness of manners, and conscientious
facility of monsieur de la noue, in so [[great]] an [[injustice]] of armed
parties (the true school of [[treason]], inhumanity, and robbery), wherein he
always kept up the [[reputation]] of a [[great]] and experienced captain.

i have taken a delight to publish in several places the hopes [[hope]] i have of
marie de gournay le jars,

     [she was adopted by him in 1588.  see leon feugere’s mademoiselle
     de gournay: ‘etude sur sa vie et ses ouvrages’.]

my adopted [[daughter]]; and certainly beloved by me more than paternally,
and enveloped in my retirement and solitude as one of the [[best]] parts of
my own being: i have no longer regard to anything in this [[world]] but her.
and if a [[man]] may presage from her [[youth]], her [[soul]] will one day be capable
of very [[great]] things; and amongst others, of the [[perfection]] of that
sacred [[friendship]], to which we do not [[read]] that any of her [[sex]] could ever
yet arrive; the sincerity and solidity of her manners are already
sufficient for it, and her affection towards me more than superabundant,
and such, in short, as that there is nothing more to be wished, if not
that the apprehension she has of my end, being now five-and-fifty years
old, might not so much afflict her.  the [[judgment]] she made of my first
essays, being a woman, so [[young]], and in this [[age]], and alone in her own
country; and the famous vehemence wherewith she loved me, and [[desired]] my
acquaintance solely from the esteem she had thence of me, before she ever
saw my face, is an incident very worthy of consideration.

other virtues [[virtue]] have had little or no credit in this [[age]]; but valour is
become popular by our civil wars [[war]]; and in this, we have souls [[soul]] brave even
to [[perfection]], and in so [[great]] number that the [[choice]] is impossible to
make.

this is all of extraordinary and uncommon grandeur that has hitherto
arrived at my [[knowledge]].

chapter xviii

of giving the lie

well, but some one will say to me, this design of making a man’s [[self]] the
subject of his writing, were indeed excusable in rare and famous [[men]], who
by their [[reputation]] had given others a curiosity to be fully informed of
them.  it is most true, i confess and [[know]] very well, that a mechanic
will scarce lift his [[eyes]] from his [[work]] to look at an ordinary [[man]],
whereas a [[man]] will forsake his [[business]] and his shop to stare at an
eminent [[person]] when he comes into a town.  it misbecomes any other to
give his own [[character]], but him who has qualities worthy of imitation,
and whose [[life]] and opinions [[opinion]] may serve for [[example]]: caesar and xenophon
had a just and solid foundation whereon to found their narrations, the
greatness of their own performances; and were to be wished that we had
the journals of alexander the [[great]], the commentaries that augustus,
cato, sylla, brutus, and others left of their actions; of such persons
men [[love]] and contemplate the very statues even in copper and marble.
this remonstrance is very true; but it very little concerns me:

         “non recito cuiquam, nisi amicis, idque coactus;
          non ubivis, coramve quibuslibet, in medio qui
          scripta foro recitant, sunt multi, quique lavantes.”

     [“i repeat my poems only to my [[friends]], and when bound to do so;
     not before every one and everywhere; there are plenty of reciters
     in the open market-place and at the baths.”--horace, sat. i. 4, 73.]

i do not here form a statue to erect in the [[great]] square of a [[city]], in a
church, or any [[public]] place:

         “non equidem hoc studeo, bullatis ut mihi nugis,
          pagina turgescat......
          secreti loquimur:”

     [“i study not to make my pages swell with empty trifles;
     you and i are talking in private.”--persius, sat., v. 19.]

‘tis for some corner of a library, or to entertain a neighbour,
a kinsman, a friend, who has a [[mind]] to renew his acquaintance and
familiarity with me in this image of myself.  others have been encouraged
to speak of themselves, because they found the [[subject]] worthy and [[rich]];
i, on the contrary, am the bolder, by [[reason]] the [[subject]] is so [[poor]] and
sterile that i cannot be suspected of ostentation.  i [[judge]] freely of the
actions of others; i give little of my own to [[judge]] of, because they are
nothing: i do not find so much [[good]] in myself, that i cannot tell it
without blushing.

what contentment would it not be to me to hear any one thus relate to me
the manners, faces, countenances, the ordinary words and fortunes [[fortune]] of my
ancestors? how attentively should i listen to it!  in earnest, it would
be [[evil]] [[nature]] to despise so much as the pictures of our [[friends]] and
predecessors, the [[fashion]] of their clothes and arms.  i preserve their
writing, seal, and a particular [[sword]] they wore, and have not thrown the
long staves my [[father]] used to carry in his hand, out of my closet.

          “paterna vestis, et annulus, tanto charior est
          posteris, quanto erga parentes major affectus.”

     [“a father’s garment and ring is by so much dearer to his [[posterity]],
     as there is the greater affection towards parents.”
      --st. aug., de civat. dei, i. 13.]

if my [[posterity]], nevertheless, shall be of another [[mind]], i shall be
avenged on them; for they cannot [[care]] less for me than i shall then do
for them.  all the traffic that i have in this with the [[public]] is, that i
borrow their utensils of writing, which are more easy and most at hand;
and in recompense shall, peradventure, keep a pound of butter in the
market from melting in the sun:--[montaigne semi-seriously speculates on
the possibility of his ms. being used to wrap up butter.]

              “ne toga cordyllis, ne penula desit olivis;
               et laxas scombris saepe dabo tunicas;”

     [“let not wrappers be wanting to tunny-fish, nor olives;
     and i shall supply loose coverings to mackerel.”
      --martial, xiii.  i, i.]

and though nobody should [[read]] me, have i wasted [[time]] in entertaining
myself so many idle hours in so pleasing and useful thoughts [[thought]]?  in
moulding this figure upon myself, i have been so often constrained to
temper and compose myself in a [[right]] posture, that the copy is truly
taken, and has in some sort formed itself; painting myself for others,
i represent myself in a [[better]] colouring than my own [[natural]] [[complexion]].
i have no more made my [[book]] than my [[book]] has made me: ‘tis a book
consubstantial with the author, of a peculiar design, a parcel of my
life, and whose [[business]] is not designed for others, as that of all other
books is.  in giving myself so continual and so exact an account of
myself, have i lost my [[time]]?  for they who sometimes cursorily survey
themselves only, do not so strictly examine themselves, nor penetrate so
deep, as he who makes it his [[business]], his study, and his employment, who
intends a lasting record, with all his fidelity, and with all his [[force]]:
the most delicious pleasures [[pleasure]] digested within, avoid leaving any trace of
themselves, and avoid the sight not only of the [[people]], but of any other
person.  how often has this [[work]] diverted me from troublesome thoughts [[thought]]?
and all that are frivolous should be reputed so.  [[nature]] has presented us
with a large faculty of entertaining ourselves alone; and often calls us
to it, to [[teach]] us that we owe ourselves in part to [[society]], but chiefly
and mostly to ourselves.  that i may habituate my fancy even to meditate
in some method and to some end, and to keep it from losing itself and
roving at random, ‘tis but to give to [[body]] and to record all the little
thoughts that [[present]] themselves to it.  i give ear to my whimsies,
because i am to record them.  it often falls out, that being displeased
at some action that civility and [[reason]] will not permit me openly to
reprove, i here disgorge myself, not without design of public
instruction: and also these poetical lashes,

                   “zon zur l’oeil, ion sur le groin,
                    zon zur le dos du sagoin,”

     [“a slap on his eye, a slap on his snout, a slap on sagoin’s
     back.”--marot. fripelippes, valet de marot a sagoin.]


imprint themselves [[better]] upon paper than upon the flesh.  what if i
listen to books [[book]] a little more attentively than ordinary, since i watch if
i can purloin anything that may adorn or support my own?  i have not at
all [[studied]] to make a [[book]]; but i have in some sort [[studied]] because i had
made it; if it be studying to scratch and pinch now one author, and then
another, either by the head or foot, not with any design to form opinions
from them, but to assist, second, and fortify those i already have
embraced. but whom shall we [[believe]] in the report he makes of himself in
so [[corrupt]] an [[age]]?  considering there are so few, if, any at all, whom we
can [[believe]] when speaking of others, where there is less interest to [[lie]].
the first thing done in the [[corruption]] of manners is banishing [[truth]];
for, as pindar says, to be true is the beginning of a [[great]] [[virtue]], and
the first article that [[plato]] requires in the governor of his [[republic]].
the [[truth]] of these days is not that which really is, but what every man
persuades another [[man]] to [[believe]]; as we generally give the name of money
not only to pieces of the dust alloy, but even to the false also, if they
will pass.  our nation has long been reproached with this [[vice]]; for
salvianus of marseilles, who lived in the [[time]] of the emperor
valentinian, says that lying and forswearing themselves is with the
french not a [[vice]], but a way of speaking.  he who would enhance this
testimony, might say that it is now a [[virtue]] in them; [[men]] form and
fashion themselves to it as to an exercise of [[honour]]; for dissimulation
is one of the most notable qualities of this [[age]].

i have often considered whence this custom that we so religiously observe
should spring, of being more highly offended with the reproach of a vice
so familiar to us than with any other, and that it should be the highest
insult that can in words be done us to reproach us with a [[lie]].  upon
examination, i find that it is [[natural]] most to defend the defects with
which we are most tainted.  it seems as if by resenting and being moved
at the accusation, we in some sort acquit ourselves of the [[fault]]; though
we have it in effect, we condemn it in outward appearance.  may it not
also be that this reproach seems to imply cowardice and feebleness of
heart? of which can there be a more manifest sign than to [[eat]] a man’s own
words--nay, to [[lie]] against a man’s own [[knowledge]]?  lying is a base [[vice]];
a [[vice]] that one of the ancients portrays in the most odious colours when
he says, “that it is to manifest a contempt of [[god]], and withal a [[fear]] of
men.”  it is not possible more fully to represent the [[horror]], baseness,
and irregularity of it; for what can a [[man]] imagine more hateful and
contemptible than to be a [[coward]] towards [[men]], and valiant against his
maker?  our [[intelligence]] being by no other way communicable to one
another but by a particular word, he who falsifies that betrays public
society.  ‘tis the only way by which we communicate our thoughts [[thought]] and
wills; ‘tis the interpreter of the [[soul]], and if it [[deceive]] us, we no
longer [[know]] nor have further tie upon one another; if that [[deceive]] us, it
breaks all our correspondence, and dissolves all the ties of [[government]].
certain nations of the newly discovered indies (i need not give them
names, seeing they are no more; for, by wonderful and unheardof [[example]],
the desolation of that [[conquest]] has extended to the utter abolition of
names and the ancient [[knowledge]] of places) offered to their gods human
blood, but only such as was drawn from the tongue and ears, to expiate
for the [[sin]] of lying, as well heard as pronounced.  that [[good]] fellow of
greece--[plutarch, [[life]] of lysander, c. 4.]--said that [[children]] are
amused with toys and [[men]] with words.

as to our diverse usages of giving the [[lie]], and the laws [[law]] of [[honour]] in
that case, and the alteration they have received, i defer saying what i
know of them to another [[time]], and shall learn, if i can, in the
meanwhile, at what [[time]] the custom took beginning of so exactly weighing
and measuring words, and of making our [[honour]] interested in them; for it
is easy to [[judge]] that it was not anciently amongst the romans and greeks [[greek]].
and it has often seemed to me [[strange]] to see them rail at and give one
another the [[lie]] without any quarrel.  their laws [[law]] of [[duty]] steered some
other course than ours.  caesar is sometimes called thief, and sometimes
drunkard, to his teeth.  we see the [[liberty]] of invective they practised
upon one another, i mean the [[greatest]] chiefs [[chief]] of [[war]] of both nations,
where words are only revenged with words, and do not proceed any farther.




chapter xix

of [[liberty]] of conscience

‘tis usual to see [[good]] intentions, if carried on without moderation, push
men on to very vicious effects.  in this dispute which has at this time
engaged [[france]] in a civil [[war]], the [[better]] and the soundest cause no doubt
is that which maintains the ancient [[religion]] and [[government]] of the
kingdom.  nevertheless, amongst the [[good]] [[men]] of that party (for i do not
speak of those who only make a pretence of it, either to execute their
own particular revenges or to gratify their avarice, or to conciliate the
favour of princes [[prince]], but of those who engage in the quarrel out of true
zeal to [[religion]] and a holy [[desire]] to maintain the [[peace]] and government
of their country), of these, i say, we see many whom passion transports
beyond the bounds of [[reason]], and sometimes inspires with counsels that
are [[unjust]] and [[violent]], and, moreover, rash.

it is [[certain]] that in those first times [[time]], when our [[religion]] began to gain
authority with the laws [[law]], zeal armed many against all sorts of pagan
books, by which the learned [[suffered]] an exceeding [[great]] loss, a disorder
that i conceive to have done more prejudice to letters than all the
flames of the barbarians.  of this cornelius tacitus is a very good
testimony; for though the [[emperor]] tacitus, his kinsman, had, by express
order, furnished all the libraries in the [[world]] with it, nevertheless one
entire copy could not escape the [[curious]] examination of those who desired
to abolish it for only five or six idle clauses that were contrary to our
belief.

they had also the trick easily to lend undue praises [[praise]] to all the emperors
who made for us, and universally to condemn all the actions of those who
were adversaries, as is evidently manifest in the [[emperor]] julian,
surnamed the apostate,

     [the [[character]] of the [[emperor]] julian was censured, when montaigne
     was at [[rome]] in 1581, by the master of the [[sacred]] palace, who,
     however, as montaigne tells us in his journal (ii.  35), referred it
     to his [[conscience]] to alter what he should [[think]] in [[bad]] taste.  this
     montaigne did not do, and this [[chapter]] supplied voltaire with the
     greater part of the praises [[praise]] he bestowed upon the [[emperor]].--leclerc.]

who was, in [[truth]], a very [[great]] and rare [[man]], a [[man]] in whose soul
philosophy was imprinted in the [[best]] characters [[character]], by which he professed to
govern all his actions; and, in [[truth]], there is no sort of [[virtue]] of
which he has not left behind him very notable examples [[example]]: in chastity (of
which the whole of his [[life]] gave manifest proof) we [[read]] the same of him
that was said of alexander and scipio, that being in the flower of his
age, for he was slain by the parthians at one-and-thirty, of a [[great]] many
very beautiful captives, he would not so much as look upon one.  as to
his [[justice]], he took himself the pains [[pain]] to hear the parties, and although
he would out of curiosity inquire what [[religion]] they were of,
nevertheless, the antipathy he had to ours never gave any counterpoise to
the balance.  he made himself several [[good]] laws [[law]], and repealed a great
part of the subsidies and taxes levied by his predecessors.

we have two [[good]] historians who were eyewitnesses of his actions: one of
whom, marcellinus, in several places of his [[history]] sharply reproves an
edict of his whereby he interdicted all [[christian]] rhetoricians and
grammarians to keep school or to [[teach]], and says he could [[wish]] that act
of his had been buried in [[silence]]: it is probable that had he done any
more severe thing against us, he, so affectionate as he was to our party,
would not have passed it over in [[silence]].  he was indeed sharp against
us, but yet no cruel [[enemy]]; for our own [[people]] tell this story of him,
that one day, walking about the [[city]] of chalcedon, maris, bishop of the
place; was so bold as to tell him that he was impious, and an [[enemy]] to
christ, at which, they say, he was no further moved than to reply,
“go, [[poor]] wretch, and lament the loss of thy [[eyes]],” to which the bishop
replied again, “i thank [[jesus]] [[christ]] for taking away my sight, that i may
not see thy impudent visage,” affecting in that, they say, a
philosophical patience.  but this action of his bears no comparison to
the [[cruelty]] that he is said to have exercised against us.  “he was,” says
eutropius,  my other witness, “an [[enemy]] to [[christianity]],  but without
putting his hand to [[blood]].”  and, to return to his [[justice]], there is
nothing in that whereof he can be accused, the severity excepted he
practised in the beginning of his reign against those who had followed
the party of constantius, his predecessor.  as to his sobriety, he lived
always a soldier-like [[life]]; and observed a diet and routine, like one
that prepared and inured himself to the austerities of [[war]].  his
vigilance was such, that he divided the night into three or four parts,
of which the least was dedicated to sleep; the rest was spent either in
visiting the [[state]] of his [[army]] and guards in [[person]], or in study; for
amongst other rare qualities, he was very excellent in all sorts of
learning.  ‘tis said of alexander the [[great]], that being in bed, for fear
lest sleep should divert him from his thoughts [[thought]] and studies, he had always
a basin set by his bedside, and held one of his hands out with a ball of
copper in it, to the end, that, beginning to fall asleep, and his fingers
leaving their hold, the ball by falling into the basin, might awake him.
but the other had his [[soul]] so bent upon what he had a [[mind]] to do, and so
little disturbed with fumes by [[reason]] of his singular abstinence, that he
had no need of any such invention.  as to his [[military]] [[experience]], he was
excellent in all the qualities of a [[great]] captain, as it was likely he
should, being almost all his [[life]] in a continual exercise of [[war]], and
most of that [[time]] with us in [[france]], against the germans and franks: we
hardly [[read]] of any [[man]] who ever saw more dangers, or who made more
frequent proofs of his personal valour.

his [[death]] has something in it parallel with that of epaminondas, for he
was wounded with an arrow, and tried to pull it out, and had done so, but
that, being edged, it cut and disabled his hand.  he incessantly called
out that they should carry him again into the heat of the [[battle]], to
encourage his soldiers, who very bravely disputed the [[fight]] without him,
till night parted the armies [[army]].  he stood obliged to his [[philosophy]] for the
singular contempt he had for his [[life]] and all [[human]] things.  he had a
firm [[belief]] of the immortality of souls [[soul]].

in matter of [[religion]] he was [[wrong]] throughout, and was surnamed the
apostate for having relinquished ours: nevertheless, the [[opinion]] seems to
me more probable, that he had never thoroughly embraced it, but had
dissembled out of [[obedience]] to the laws [[law]], till he came to the [[empire]].
he was in his own so [[superstitious]], that he was laughed at for it by
those of his own [[time]], of the same [[opinion]], who jeeringly said, that had
he got the [[victory]] over the parthians, he had destroyed the breed of oxen
in the [[world]] to supply his sacrifices [[sacrifice]].  he was, moreover, besotted with
the art [[arts]] of divination, and gave [[authority]] to all sorts of predictions.
he said, amongst other things at his [[death]], that he was obliged to the
gods, and thanked them, in that they would not cut him off by surprise,
having long before advertised him of the place and hour of his [[death]], nor
by a mean and unmanly [[death]], more becoming lazy and delicate [[people]]; nor
by a [[death]] that was languishing, long, and painful; and that they had
thought him worthy to [[die]] after that [[noble]] manner, in the [[progress]] of his
victories, in the flower of his [[glory]].  he had a vision like that of
marcus brutus, that first threatened him in gaul, and afterward appeared
to him in [[persia]] just before his [[death]].  these words that some make him
say when he [[felt]] himself wounded: “thou hast overcome, nazarene”; or as
others, “content thyself, nazarene”; would hardly have been omitted, had
they been believed, by my witnesses, who, being [[present]] in the [[army]], have
set down to the least motions and words of his end; no more than certain
other [[miracles]] that are reported about it.

and to return to my [[subject]], he long nourished, says marcellinus,
paganism in his [[heart]]; but all his [[army]] being christians [[christian]], he durst not
own it.  but in the end, seeing himself [[strong]] enough to dare to discover
himself, he caused the temples of the gods to be thrown open, and did his
uttermost to set on foot and to encourage idolatry.  which the [[better]] to
effect, having at constantinople found the [[people]] disunited, and also the
prelates of the [[church]] divided amongst themselves, having convened them
all before him, he earnestly admonished them to calm those civil
dissensions, and that every one might freely, and without [[fear]], follow
his own [[religion]].  which he the more sedulously solicited, in [[hope]] that
this licence would augment the schisms and factions of their division,
and hinder the [[people]] from reuniting, and consequently fortifying
themselves against him by their unanimous [[intelligence]] and concord;
having experienced by the [[cruelty]] of some christians [[christian]], that there is no
beast in the [[world]] so much to be feared by [[man]] as [[man]]; these are very
nearly his words.

wherein this is very worthy of consideration, that the [[emperor]] julian
made use of the same receipt of [[liberty]] of [[conscience]] to inflame the
civil dissensions that our kings [[king]] do to extinguish them.  so that a man
may say on one side, that to give the [[people]] the reins to entertain every
man his own [[opinion]], is to scatter and sow division, and, as it were, to
lend a hand to augment it, there being no legal impediment or restraint
to stop or hinder their [[career]]; but, on the other side, a [[man]] may also
say, that to give the [[people]] the reins to entertain every [[man]] his own
opinion, is to mollify and appease them by facility and toleration, and
to dull the point which is whetted and made sharper by singularity,
novelty, and difficulty: and i [[think]] it is [[better]] for the [[honour]] of the
devotion of our kings [[king]], that not having been able to do what they would,
they have made a show of being willing to do what they could.




chapter xx

that we taste nothing pure

the feebleness of our condition is such that things cannot, in their
natural simplicity and purity, fall into our use; the elements that we
enjoy are changed, and so ‘tis with metals; and gold must be debased with
some other matter to fit it for our service.  neither has [[virtue]], so
simple as that which aristo, pyrrho, and also the stoics, made the end of
life; nor the cyrenaic and aristippic [[pleasure]], been without mixture
useful to it.  of the [[pleasure]] and goods [[good]] that we enjoy, there is not one
exempt from some mixture of ill and inconvenience:

                         “medio de fonte leporum,
          surgit amari aliquid, quod in ipsis fioribus angat.”

     [“from the very fountain of our [[pleasure]], something rises that is
     bitter, which even in flowers destroys.”--lucretius, iv. 1130.]

our extremest [[pleasure]] has some sort of groaning and complaining in it;
would you not say that it is dying of [[pain]]?  nay, when we frame the image
of it in its full excellence, we stuff it with sickly and painful
epithets and qualities, languor, softness, feebleness, faintness,
‘morbidezza’: a [[great]] testimony of their consanguinity and
consubstantiality.  the most profound joy has more of severity than
gaiety, in it.  the highest and fullest contentment offers more of the
grave than of the merry:

               “ipsa felicitas, se nisi temperat, premit.”

          [“even felicity, unless it moderate itself, oppresses?”
           --seneca, ep. 74.]

pleasure chews and grinds us; according to the old [[greek]] verse, which
says that the gods sell us all the goods [[good]] they give us; that is to say,
that they give us nothing pure and [[perfect]], and that we do not purchase
but at the price of some [[evil]].

labour and [[pleasure]], very unlike in [[nature]], associate, nevertheless,
by i [[know]] not what [[natural]] conjunction.  [[socrates]] says, that some god
tried to mix in one mass and to confound [[pain]] and [[pleasure]], but not being
able to do it; he bethought him at least to couple them by the tail.
metrodorus said, that in [[sorrow]] there is some mixture of [[pleasure]].  i
know not whether or no he intended anything else by that saying; but for
my part, i am of [[opinion]] that there is design, [[consent]], and complacency
in giving a man’s [[self]] up to melancholy. i say, that besides [[ambition]],
which may also have a stroke in the [[business]], there is some shadow of
delight and delicacy which smiles upon and flatters us even in the very
lap of melancholy.  are there not some constitutions [[constitution]] that feed upon it?

                    “est quaedam flere voluptas;”

               [“‘tis a [[certain]] [[kind]] of [[pleasure]] to weep.”
                --ovid, trist., iv.  3, 27.]

and one attalus in seneca says, that the memory of our lost [[friends]] is as
grateful to us, as bitterness in wine, when too old, is to the palate:

                    “minister vetuli, puer, falerni
                    inger’ mi calices amariores”--

     [“boy, when you pour out old falernian wine, the bitterest put
     into my bowl.”--catullus, xxvii. i.]

and as apples that have a sweet tartness.

nature discovers this confusion to us; painters hold that the same
motions and grimaces of the face that serve for weeping; serve for
laughter too; and indeed, before the one or the other be finished, do but
observe the painter’s manner of handling, and you will be in [[doubt]] to
which of the two the design tends; and the extreme of laughter does at
last bring tears:

               “nullum sine auctoramento malum est.”

          [“no [[evil]] is without its compensation.”--seneca, ep., 69.]

when i imagine [[man]] abounding with all the conveniences that are to be
desired (let us put the case that all his members were always seized with
a [[pleasure]] like that of [[generation]], in its most excessive height) i feel
him melting under the weight of his delight, and see him utterly unable
to support so pure, so continual, and so universal a [[pleasure]].  indeed,
he is running away whilst he is there, and naturally makes haste to
escape, as from a place where he cannot stand firm, and where he is
afraid of sinking.

when i religiously confess myself to myself, i find that the [[best]] virtue
i have has in it some tincture of [[vice]]; and i am afraid that [[plato]], in
his purest [[virtue]] (i, who am as sincere and [[loyal]] a lover of [[virtue]] of
that stamp as any other whatever), if he had listened and laid his ear
close to himself and he did so no doubt--would have heard some jarring
note of [[human]] mixture, but faint and only perceptible to himself.  [[man]] is
wholly and throughout but patch and motley.  even the laws [[law]] of justice
themselves cannot subsist without mixture of [[injustice]]; insomuch that
plato says, they undertake to cut off the hydra’s head, who pretend to
clear the [[law]] of all inconveniences:

          “omne magnum exemplum habet aliquid ex iniquo,
          quod contra singulos utilitate publics rependitur,”

     [“every [[great]] [[example]] has in it some mixture of [[injustice]], which
     recompenses the [[wrong]] done to particular [[men]] by the [[public]] utility.”
      --annals, xiv. 44.]

says tacitus.

it is likewise true, that for the use of [[life]] and the service of public
commerce, there may be some excesses in the purity and perspicacity of
our minds [[mind]]; that penetrating [[light]] has in it too much of subtlety and
curiosity: we must a little stupefy and blunt them to render them more
obedient to [[example]] and practice, and a little veil and obscure them, the
better to proportion them to this dark and earthly [[life]].  and therefore
common and less speculative souls [[soul]] are found to be more proper for and
more successful in the management of affairs, and the elevated and
exquisite opinions [[opinion]] of [[philosophy]] unfit for [[business]].  this sharp vivacity
of [[soul]], and the supple and restless volubility attending it, disturb our
negotiations.  we are to manage [[human]] enterprises more superficially and
roughly, and leave a [[great]] part to [[fortune]]; it is not necessary to
examine affairs with so much subtlety and so deep: a [[man]] loses himself in
the consideration of many contrary lustres, and so many various forms:

     “volutantibus res inter se pugnantes, obtorpuerunt.... animi.”

     [“whilst they considered of things so indifferent in themselves,
     they were astonished, and knew not what to do.”--livy, xxxii. 20.]

‘tis what the ancients say of simonides, that by [[reason]] his imagination
suggested to him, upon the [[question]] [[king]] hiero had put to him--[what god
was.--cicero, de nat.  deor., i.  22.]--(to [[answer]] which he had had many
days for thought), several sharp and subtle considerations, whilst he
doubted which was the most likely, he totally despaired of the [[truth]].

he who dives into and in his inquisition comprehends all circumstances
and consequences, hinders his election: a little engine well handled is
sufficient for executions, whether of less or greater weight.  the best
managers are those who can worst give account how they are so; while the
greatest talkers, for the most part, do nothing to [[purpose]]; i [[know]] one of
this sort of [[men]], and a most excellent discourser upon all sorts of good
husbandry, who has miserably let a hundred thousand livres yearly revenue
slip through his hands; i [[know]] another who talks, who [[better]] advises than
any [[man]] of his counsel, and there is not in the [[world]] a fairer show of
soul and understanding than he has; nevertheless, when he comes to the
test, his servants find him quite another thing; not to make any mention
of his misfortunes.




chapter xxi

against idleness

the [[emperor]] vespasian, being sick of the disease whereof he died, did not
for all that neglect to inquire after the [[state]] of the [[empire]], and even
in bed continually despatched very many affairs of [[great]] consequence; for
which, being reproved by his physician, as a thing prejudicial to his
health, “an [[emperor]],” said he, “must [[die]] standing.”  a fine saying, in my
opinion, and worthy a [[great]] [[prince]].  the [[emperor]] adrian since made use of
the same words, and kings [[king]] should be often put in [[mind]] of them, to make
them [[know]] that the [[great]] office conferred upon them of the command of so
many [[men]], is not an employment of ease; and that there is nothing can so
justly disgust a [[subject]], and make him unwilling to expose himself to
labour and danger for the service of his [[prince]], than to see him, in the
meantime, devoted to his ease and frivolous amusement, and to be
solicitous of his preservation who so much neglects that of his [[people]].

whoever will take upon him to maintain that ‘tis [[better]] for a [[prince]] to
carry on his wars [[war]] by others, than in his own [[person]], [[fortune]] will furnish
him with examples [[example]] enough of those whose lieutenants have brought great
enterprises to a [[happy]] issue, and of those also whose presence has done
more hurt than [[good]]: but no [[virtuous]] and valiant [[prince]] can with patience
endure so dishonourable councils.  under colour of saving his head, like
the statue of a saint, for the [[happiness]] of his [[kingdom]], they degrade him
from and declare him incapable of his office, which is military
throughout: i [[know]] one--[probably henry iv.]--who had much rather be
beaten, than to sleep whilst another fights for him; and who never
without [[jealousy]] heard of any brave thing done even by his own officers
in his absence.  and soliman i. said, with very [[good]] [[reason]], in my
opinion, that victories [[victory]] obtained without the master were never complete.
much more would he have said that that master ought to blush for shame,
to pretend to any share in the [[honour]], having contributed nothing to the
work, but his voice and [[thought]]; nor even so much as these, considering
that in such [[work]] as that, the direction and command that deserve honour
are only such as are given upon the spot, and in the heat of the
business.  no pilot performs his office by standing still.  the princes
of the ottoman [[family]], the chiefest in the [[world]] in [[military]] [[fortune]],
have warmly embraced this [[opinion]], and bajazet ii., with his [[son]], who
swerved from it, spending their [[time]] in [[science]] and other retired
employments, gave [[great]] blows to their [[empire]]; and amurath iii., now
reigning, following their [[example]], begins to find the same.  was it not
edward iii., [[king]] of [[england]], who said this of our charles v.: “there
never was [[king]] who so seldom put on his armour, and yet never [[king]] who
gave me so much to do.”  he had [[reason]] to [[think]] it [[strange]], as an effect
of [[chance]] more than of [[reason]].  and let those seek out some other to join
with them than me, who will reckon the kings [[king]] of castile and portugal
amongst the warlike and magnanimous conquerors, because at the distance
of twelve hundred leagues from their lazy abode, by the conduct of their
captains, they made themselves masters of both indies; of which it has to
be known if they would have had even the [[courage]] to go and in person
enjoy them.

the [[emperor]] julian said yet further, that a philosopher and a brave man
ought not so much as to breathe; that is to say, not to allow any more to
bodily necessities than what we cannot refuse; keeping the [[soul]] and body
still intent and busy about honourable, [[great]], and [[virtuous]] things.  he
was ashamed if any one in [[public]] saw him spit, or sweat (which is said by
some, also, of the lacedaemonian [[young]] [[men]], and which xenophon says of
the persian), forasmuch as he conceived that exercise, continual [[labour]],
and sobriety, ought to have dried up all those superfluities.  what
seneca says will not be unfit for this place; which is, that the ancient
romans kept their [[youth]] always standing, and taught them nothing that
they were to learn sitting.

‘tis a generous [[desire]] to [[wish]] to [[die]] usefully and like a [[man]], but the
effect lies [[lie]] not so much in our resolution as in our [[good]] [[fortune]]; a
thousand have proposed to themselves in [[battle]], either to overcome or to
die, who have failed both in the one and the other, wounds and
imprisonment crossing their design and compelling them to [[live]] against
their will.  there are diseases that overthrow even our desires [[desire]], and our
knowledge.  [[fortune]] ought not to second the vanity of the roman legions,
who bound themselves by oath, either to overcome or [[die]]:

     “victor, marce fabi, revertar ex acie: si fallo, jovem patrem,
     gradivumque martem aliosque iratos invoco deos.”

     [“i will return, marcus fabius, a conqueror, from the [[fight]]:
     and if i fail, i invoke [[father]] jove, [[mars]] gradivus, and the
     other angry gods.”--livy, ii. 45.]

the portuguese say that in a [[certain]] place of their [[conquest]] of the
indies, they met with soldiers who had condemned themselves, with
horrible execrations, to enter into no other composition but either to
cause themselves to be slain, or to remain victorious; and had their
heads and beards shaved in token of this vow.  ‘tis to much [[purpose]] for
us to hazard ourselves and to be obstinate: it seems as if blows avoided
those who [[present]] themselves too briskly to them, and do not willingly
fall upon those who too willingly seek them, and so defeat them of their
design.  such there have been, who, after having tried all ways, not
having been able with all their endeavour to obtain the favour of dying
by the hand of the [[enemy]], have been constrained, to make [[good]] their
resolution of bringing [[home]] the [[honour]] of [[victory]] or of losing their
lives, to kill themselves even in the heat of [[battle]].  of which there are
other examples [[example]], but this is one: philistus, general of the naval [[army]] of
dionysius the younger against the syracusans, presented them [[battle]] which
was sharply disputed, their forces [[force]] being [[equal]]: in this engagement, he
had the [[better]] at the first, through his own valour: but the syracusans
drawing about his gally to environ him, after having done [[great]] things in
his own [[person]] to disengage himself and hoping for no relief, with his
own hand he took away the [[life]] he had so liberally, and in [[vain]], exposed
to the [[enemy]].

mule moloch, [[king]] of fez, who lately won against sebastian, [[king]] of
portugal, the [[battle]] so famous for the [[death]] of three kings [[king]], and for the
transmission of that [[great]] [[kingdom]] to the [[crown]] of castile, was extremely
sick when the portuguese entered in an hostile manner into his dominions;
and from that day forward grew worse and worse, still drawing nearer to
and foreseeing his end; yet never did [[man]] [[better]] employ his own
sufficiency more vigorously and bravely than he did upon this [[occasion]].
he found himself too [[weak]] to undergo the pomp and [[ceremony]] of entering.
into his camp, which after their manner is very magnificent, and
therefore resigned that [[honour]] to his [[brother]]; but this was all of the
office of a general that he resigned; all the rest of [[greatest]] utility
and necessity he most, exactly and gloriously performed in his own
person; his [[body]] lying upon a couch, but his [[judgment]] and [[courage]] upright
and firm to his [[last]] gasp, and in some sort beyond it.  he might have
wasted his [[enemy]], indiscreetly advanced into his dominions, without
striking a blow; and it was a very unhappy occurrence, that for want of a
little [[life]] or somebody to substitute in the conduct of this [[war]] and the
affairs of a troubled [[state]], he was compelled to seek a doubtful and
bloody [[victory]], having another by a [[better]] and surer way already in his
hands.  notwithstanding, he wonderfully managed the continuance of his
sickness in consuming the [[enemy]], and in drawing them far from the
assistance of the navy and the ports they had on the coast of [[africa]],
even till the [[last]] day of his [[life]], which he designedly reserved for this
great [[battle]].  he arranged his battalions in a circular form, environing
the portuguese [[army]] on every side, which round circle coming to close in
and to draw up close together, not only hindered them in the conflict
(which was very sharp through the valour of the [[young]] invading king),
considering that they had every way to [[present]] a front, but prevented
their flight after the defeat, so that finding all passages possessed and
shut up by the [[enemy]], they were constrained to close up together again:

          “coacerventurque non solum caede, sed etiam fuga,”

          [“piled up not only in slaughter but in flight.”]

and there they were slain in heaps upon one another, leaving to the
conqueror a very bloody and entire [[victory]].  dying, he caused himself to
be carried and hurried from place to place where most need was, and
passing along the files, encouraged the captains and soldiers one after
another; but a corner of his main battalions being broken, he was not to
be held from mounting on horseback with his [[sword]] in his hand; he did his
utmost to break from those about him, and to rush into the thickest of
the [[battle]], they all the while withholding him, some by the bridle, some
by his robe, and others by his stirrups.  this [[last]] effort totally
overwhelmed the little [[life]] he had left; they again laid him upon his
bed; but coming to himself, and starting as it were out of his swoon, all
other faculties failing, to give his [[people]] notice that they were to
conceal his [[death]] the most necessary command he had then to give, that
his soldiers might not be discouraged (with the news) he expired with his
finger upon his mouth, the ordinary sign of keeping [[silence]].  who ever
lived so long and so far into [[death]]? whoever died so erect, or more like
a [[man]]?

the most extreme [[degree]] of courageously treating [[death]], and the most
natural, is to look upon it not only without astonishment but without
care, continuing the wonted course of [[life]] even into it, as cato did,
who entertained himself in study, and went to sleep, having a [[violent]] and
bloody [[death]] in his [[heart]], and the weapon in his hand with which he was
resolved to despatch himself.




chapter xxii

of posting

i have been none of the least able in this exercise, which is proper for
men of my pitch, well-knit and short; but i give it over; it shakes us
too much to continue it long.  i was at this moment reading,  that king
cyrus, the [[better]] to have news brought him from all parts of the [[empire]],
which was of a vast extent, caused it to be tried how far a horse could
go in a day without baiting, and at that distance appointed [[men]], whose
business it was to have horses always in readiness, to mount those who
were despatched to him; and some say, that this swift way of posting is
equal to that of the flight of cranes.

caesar says, that lucius vibullius rufus, being in [[great]] haste to carry
intelligence to pompey, rode night and day, still taking fresh horses for
the greater diligence and speed; and he himself, as suetonius reports,
travelled a hundred miles a day in a hired coach; but he was a furious
courier, for where the rivers stopped his way he passed them by swimming,
without turning out of his way to look for either bridge or ford.
tiberius nero, going to see his [[brother]] drusus, who was sick in germany,
travelled two hundred miles in four-and-twenty hours, having three
coaches.  in the [[war]] of the romans against [[king]] antiochus, t. sempronius
gracchus, says livy:

         “per dispositos equos prope incredibili celeritate
          ab amphissa tertio [[die]] pellam pervenit.”

     [“by pre-arranged relays of horses, he, with an almost incredible
     speed, rode in three days from amphissa to pella.”
      --livy, xxxvii. 7.]

and it appears that they were established posts, and not horses purposely
laid in upon this [[occasion]].

cecina’s invention to send back news to his [[family]] was much more quick,
for he took swallows along with him from [[home]], and turned them out
towards their nests when he would send back any news; setting a mark of
some colour upon them to signify his meaning, according to what he and
his [[people]] had before agreed upon.

at the theatre at [[rome]] masters of families [[family]] carried pigeons in their
bosoms to which they tied letters when they had a [[mind]] to send any orders
to their [[people]] at [[home]]; and the pigeons were trained up to bring back an
answer.  d. brutus made use of the same device when besieged in modena,
and others elsewhere have done the same.

in peru they rode post upon [[men]], who took them upon their shoulders in a
certain [[kind]] of litters made for that [[purpose]], and ran with such agility
that, in their full speed, the first couriers transferred their load to
the second without making any stop.

i [[understand]] that the wallachians, the grand signior’s couriers, perform
wonderful journeys, by [[reason]] they have [[liberty]] to dismount the first
person they meet upon the road, giving him their own tired horses; and
that to preserve themselves from being weary, they gird themselves
straight about the middle with a broad girdle;  but i could never find
any benefit from this.




chapter xxiii

of ill means employed to a [[good]] end

there is wonderful relation and correspondence in this universal
government of the works [[work]] of [[nature]], which very well makes it appear that
it is neither accidental nor carried on by divers masters.  the diseases
and conditions of our bodies [[body]] are, in like manner, manifest in states and
governments; kingdoms [[kingdom]] and republics [[republic]] are founded, flourish, and decay with
age as we do.  we are [[subject]] to a repletion of humours [[humour]], useless and
dangerous: whether of those that are [[good]] (for even those the physicians
are afraid of; and seeing we have nothing in us that is stable, they say
that a too brisk and vigorous [[perfection]] of health must be abated by art [[arts]],
lest our [[nature]], unable to rest in any [[certain]] condition, and not having
whither to rise to mend itself, make too sudden and too disorderly a
retreat; and therefore prescribe wrestlers to purge and bleed, to qualify
that superabundant health), or else a repletion of [[evil]] humours [[humour]], which is
the ordinary cause of sickness.  states are very often sick of the like
repletion, and various sorts of purgations have commonly been applied.
some times [[time]] a [[great]] multitude of families [[family]] are turned out to clear the
country, who seek out new abodes elsewhere and encroach upon others.
after this manner our ancient franks came from the remotest part of
germany to seize upon gaul, and to drive thence the first inhabitants;
so was that infinite deluge of [[men]] made up who came into [[italy]] under the
conduct of brennus and others; so the goths and vandals, and also the
people who now possess greece, left their native [[country]] to go settle
elsewhere, where they might have more room; and there are scarce two or
three little corners in the [[world]] that have not [[felt]] the effect of such
removals.  the romans by this means erected their colonies; for,
perceiving their [[city]] to grow immeasurably populous, they eased it of the
most unnecessary [[people]], and sent them to inhabit and cultivate the lands
conquered by them; sometimes also they purposely maintained wars [[war]] with
some of their enemies [[enemy]], not only to keep their own [[men]] in action, for fear
lest idleness, the [[mother]] of [[corruption]], should bring upon them some
worse inconvenience:

              “et patimur longae pacis mala; saevior armis
               luxuria incumbit.”

     [“and we suffer the ills of a long [[peace]]; luxury is more pernicious
     than [[war]].”--juvenal, vi. 291.]

but also to serve for a blood-letting to their [[republic]], and a little to
evaporate the too vehement heat of their [[youth]], to prune and clear the
branches from the stock too luxuriant in wood; and to this end it was
that they maintained so long a [[war]] with [[carthage]].

in the treaty of bretigny, edward iii., [[king]] of [[england]], would not, in
the general [[peace]] he then made with our [[king]], comprehend the controversy
about the duchy of brittany, that he might have a place wherein to
discharge himself of his soldiers, and that the vast number of english he
had brought over to serve him in his expedition here might not return
back into [[england]].  and this also was one [[reason]] why our [[king]] philip
consented to send his [[son]] john upon a [[foreign]] expedition, that he might
take along with him a [[great]] number of hot [[young]] [[men]] who were then in his
pay.

there--are many in our times [[time]] who talk at this rate, wishing that
this hot emotion that is now amongst us might discharge itself in some
neighbouring [[war]], for [[fear]] lest all the peccant humours [[humour]] that now reign in
this [[politic]] [[body]] of ours may diffuse themselves farther, keep the fever
still in the height, and at [[last]] cause our total ruin; and, in [[truth]], a
foreign is much more supportable than a civil [[war]], but i do not believe
that [[god]] will favour so [[unjust]] a design as to offend and quarrel with
others for our own advantage:

              “nil mihi tam valde placeat, rhamnusia virgo,
               quod temere invitis suscipiatur heris.”

     [“rhamnusian virgin, let nothing ever so greatly please me which is
     taken without [[justice]] from the unwilling owners”
      --catullus, lxviii. 77.]

and yet the weakness of our condition often pushes us upon the necessity
of making use of ill means to a [[good]] end.  lycurgus, the most perfect
legislator that ever was, [[virtuous]] and [[invented]] this very [[unjust]] practice
of making the helots, who were their slaves [[slave]], drunk by [[force]], to the end
that the spartans, seeing them so lost and buried in wine, might abhor
the excess of this [[vice]].  and yet those were still more to blame who of
old gave leave that criminals [[criminal]], to what sort of [[death]] soever condemned,
should be cut up alive by the physicians, that they might make a true
discovery of our inward parts, and build their art [[arts]] upon greater
certainty; for, if we must run into excesses, it is more excusable to do
it for the health of the [[soul]] than that of the [[body]]; as the romans
trained up the [[people]] to valour and the contempt of dangers and [[death]] by
those furious spectacles of gladiators and fencers, who, having to fight
it out to the [[last]], cut, mangled, and killed one another in their
presence:

         “quid vesani aliud sibi vult ars impia ludi,
          quid mortes juvenum, quid sanguine pasta voluptas?”

     [“what other end does the impious art [[arts]] of the gladiators propose to
     itself, what the slaughter of [[young]] [[men]], what [[pleasure]] fed with
     [[blood]].”--prudentius, contra symmachum, ii. 643.]

and this custom continued till the [[emperor]] theodosius’ [[time]]:

         “arripe dilatam tua, dux, in tempora famam,
          quodque patris superest, successor laudis habeto
          nullus in urbe cadat, cujus sit poena voluptas....
          jam solis contenta feris, infamis arena
          nulla cruentatis homicidia ludat in armis.”

     [“prince, take the honours [[honour]] delayed for thy reign, and be successor
     to thy fathers [[father]]; henceforth let none at [[rome]] be slain for [[sport]].  let
     beasts’ [[blood]] stain the infamous arena, and no more homicides be
     there acted.”--prudentius, contra symmachum, ii. 643.]

it was, in [[truth]], a wonderful [[example]], and of [[great]] advantage for the
training up the [[people]], to see every day before their [[eyes]] a hundred; two
hundred, nay, a thousand couples of [[men]] armed against one another, cut
one another to pieces with so [[great]] a constancy of [[courage]], that they
were never heard to utter so much as one syllable of weakness or
commiseration; never seen to turn their backs, nor so much as to make one
cowardly step to evade a blow, but rather exposed their necks to the
adversary’s [[sword]] and presented themselves to receive the stroke; and
many of them, when wounded to [[death]], have sent to ask the spectators if
they were satisfied with their behaviour, before they lay down to die
upon the place.  it was not enough for them to [[fight]] and to [[die]] bravely,
but cheerfully too; insomuch that they were hissed and cursed if they
made any hesitation about receiving their [[death]].  the very girls
themselves set them on:

              “consurgit ad ictus,
               et, quoties victor ferrum jugulo inserit, illa
               delicias ait esse suas, pectusque jacentis
               virgo modesta jubet converso pollice rumpi.”

     [“the modest virgin is so delighted with the [[sport]], that she
     applauds the blow, and when the victor bathes his [[sword]] in his
     fellow’s throat, she says it is her [[pleasure]], and with turned thumb
     orders him to rip up the bosom of the prostrate victim.”
      --prudentius, contra symmachum, ii. 617.]

the first romans only condemned criminals [[criminal]] to this [[example]]: but they
afterwards employed [[innocent]] slaves [[slave]] in the [[work]], and even freemen too,
who sold themselves to this [[purpose]], nay, moreover, senators and knights
of [[rome]], and also [[women]]:

         “nunc caput in mortem vendunt, et funus arena,
          atque hostem sibi quisque parat, cum bella quiescunt.”

     [“they sell themselves to [[death]] and the circus, and, since the wars
     are ceased, each for himself a foe prepares.”
      --manilius, astron., iv. 225.]

              “hos inter fremitus novosque lusus....
               stat sexus rudis insciusque ferri,
               et pugnas capit improbus viriles;”


     [“amidst these tumults and new sports [[sport]], the tender [[sex]], unskilled in
     arms, immodestly engaged in manly fights.”
      --statius, sylv., i. 6, 51.]

which i should [[think]] [[strange]] and incredible, if we were not accustomed
every day to see in our own wars [[war]] many thousands of [[men]] of other nations,
for [[money]] to stake their [[blood]] and their lives [[life]] in quarrels wherein they
have no manner of concern.




chapter xxiv

of the roman grandeur

i will only say a word or two of this infinite argument, to show the
simplicity of those who compare the pitiful greatness of these times [[time]] with
that of [[rome]].  in the seventh [[book]] of cicero’s familiar epistles (and let
the grammarians put out that surname of familiar if they please, for in
truth it is not very suitable; and they who, instead of familiar, have
substituted “ad familiares,” may gather something to justify them for so
doing out of what suetonius says in the [[life]] of caesar, that there was a
volume of letters of his “ad familiares “) there is one directed to
caesar, then in gaul, wherein cicero repeats these words, which were in
the end of another letter that caesar had written to him: “as to what
concerns marcus furius, whom you have recommended to me, i will make him
king of gaul, and if you would have me advance any other friend of yours
send him to me.”  it was no new thing for a simple citizen of [[rome]], as
caesar then was, to dispose of kingdoms [[kingdom]], for he took away that of king
deiotarus from him to give it to a gentleman of the [[city]] of pergamus,
called mithridates; and they who wrote his [[life]] record several cities
sold by him; and suetonius says, that he had once from [[king]] ptolemy three
millions and six hundred thousand crowns [[crown]], which was very like selling him
his own [[kingdom]]:

          “tot galatae, tot pontus, tot lydia, nummis.”

          [“so much for galatia, so much for pontus,
          so much for lydia.”--claudius in eutrop., i. 203.]

marcus antonius said, that the greatness of the [[people]] of [[rome]] was not
so much seen in what they took, as in what they gave; and, indeed, some
ages before antonius, they had dethroned one amongst the rest with so
wonderful [[authority]], that in all the roman [[history]] i have not observed
anything that more denotes the height of their [[power]].  antiochus
possessed all [[egypt]], and was, moreover, ready to conquer cyprus and other
appendages of that [[empire]]: when being upon the [[progress]] of his victories [[victory]],
c. popilius came to him from the senate, and at their first meeting
refused to take him by the hand, till he had first [[read]] his letters,
which after the [[king]] had [[read]], and told him he would consider of them,
popilius made a circle about him with his cane, saying:--“return me an
answer, that i may carry it back to the senate, before thou stirrest out
of this circle.”   antiochus, astonished at the roughness of so positive
a command, after a little pause, replied, “i will obey the senate’s
command.”  then popilius saluted him as friend of the roman [[people]].
to have renounced claim to so [[great]] a [[monarchy]], and a course of such
successful [[fortune]], from the effects of three lines in writing!  truly
he had [[reason]], as he afterwards did, to send the senate word by his
ambassadors, that he had received their order with the same [[respect]] as if
it had come from the [[immortal]] gods.

all the kingdoms [[kingdom]] that augustus gained by the [[right]] of [[war]], he either
restored to those who had lost them or presented them to strangers.  and
tacitus, in reference to this, speaking of cogidunus, [[king]] of [[england]],
gives us, by a marvellous touch, an instance of that infinite [[power]]: the
romans, says he, were from all antiquity accustomed to leave the kings
they had subdued in possession of their kingdoms [[kingdom]] under their [[authority]].

          “ut haberent instruments servitutis et reges.”

     [“that they might have even kings [[king]] to be their slaves [[slave]].”
      --livy, xlv. 13.]

‘tis probable that solyman, whom we have seen make a gift of hungary and
other principalities, had therein more [[respect]] to this consideration than
to that he was wont to allege, viz., that he was glutted and overcharged
with so many monarchies [[monarchy]] and so much dominion, as his own valour and that
of his [[ancestors]] had acquired.




chapter xxv

not to counterfeit being sick

there is an epigram in martial, and one of the very [[good]] ones--for he has
of all sorts--where he pleasantly tells the story of caelius, who, to
avoid making his court to some [[great]] [[men]] of [[rome]], to wait their rising,
and to attend them abroad, pretended to have the gout; and the [[better]] to
colour this anointed his legs, and had them lapped up in a [[great]] many
swathings, and perfectly counterfeited both the gesture and countenance
of a gouty [[person]]; till in the end, [[fortune]] did him the [[kindness]] to make
him one indeed:

              “quantum curs potest et ars doloris
               desiit fingere caelius podagram.”

     [“how [[great]] is the [[power]] of counterfeiting [[pain]]: caelius has ceased
     to feign the gout; he has got it.”--martial, ep., vii. 39, 8.]

i [[think]] i have [[read]] somewhere in appian a story like this, of one who to
escape the proscriptions of the triumvirs of [[rome]], and the [[better]] to be
concealed from the discovery of those who pursued him, having hidden
himself in a [[disguise]], would yet add this invention, to counterfeit
having but one eye; but when he came to have a little more [[liberty]], and
went to take off the plaster he had a [[great]] while worn over his eye, he
found he had totally lost the sight of it indeed, and that it was
absolutely gone.  ‘tis possible that the action of sight was dulled from
having been so long without exercise, and that the optic [[power]] was wholly
retired into the other eye: for we evidently perceive that the eye we
keep shut sends some part of its [[virtue]] to its fellow, so that it will
swell and grow bigger; and so inaction, with the heat of ligatures and,
plasters, might very well have brought some gouty [[humour]] upon the
counterfeiter in martial.

reading in froissart the vow of a troop of [[young]] english gentlemen, to
keep their left [[eyes]] bound up till they had arrived in [[france]] and
performed some notable exploit upon us, i have often been tickled with
this [[thought]], that it might have befallen them as it did those others,
and they might have returned with but an eye a-piece to their mistresses,
for whose sakes they had made this ridiculous vow.

mothers have [[reason]] to rebuke their [[children]] when they counterfeit having
but one eye, squinting, lameness, or any other personal defect; for,
besides that their bodies [[body]] being then so tender, may be [[subject]] to take an
ill bent, [[fortune]], i [[know]] not how, sometimes seems to delight in taking
us at our word; and i have heard several examples [[example]] related of [[people]] who
have become really sick, by only feigning to be so.  i have always used,
whether on horseback or on foot, to carry a stick in my hand, and even to
affect doing it with an elegant air; many have threatened that this fancy
would one day be turned into necessity: if so, i should be the first of
my [[family]] to have the gout.

but let us a little lengthen this [[chapter]], and add another anecdote
concerning blindness.  pliny reports of one who, dreaming he was blind,
found himself so indeed in the morning without any preceding infirmity in
his [[eyes]].  the [[force]] of [[imagination]] might assist in this case, as i have
said elsewhere, and pliny seems to be of the same [[opinion]]; but it is more
likely that the motions which the [[body]] [[felt]] within, of which physicians,
if they please, may find out the cause, taking away his sight, were the
occasion of his [[dream]].

let us add another story, not very improper for this [[subject]], which
seneca relates in one of his epistles: “you [[know]],” says he, writing to
lucilius, “that harpaste, my wife’s [[fool]], is thrown upon me as an
hereditary charge, for i have naturally an aversion to those monsters;
and if i have a [[mind]] to laugh at a [[fool]], i need not seek him far; i can
laugh at myself.  this [[fool]] has suddenly lost her sight: i tell you a
strange, but a very true thing she is not sensible that she is blind, but
eternally importunes her keeper to take her abroad, because she says the
house is dark.  that what we laugh at in her, i [[pray]] you to [[believe]],
happens to every one of us: no one knows [[know]] himself to be avaricious or
grasping; and, again, the blind call for a guide, while we stray of our
own accord.  i am not ambitious, we say; but a [[man]] cannot [[live]] otherwise
at [[rome]]; i am not wasteful, but the [[city]] requires a [[great]] outlay; ‘tis
not my [[fault]] if i am choleric--if i have not yet established any certain
course of [[life]]: ‘tis the [[fault]] of [[youth]].  let us not seek our disease out
of ourselves; ‘tis in us, and planted in our bowels; and the mere fact
that we do not perceive ourselves to be sick, renders us more hard to be
cured.  if we do not betimes begin to see to ourselves, when shall we
have provided for so many wounds and evils [[evil]] wherewith we abound?  and yet
we have a most sweet and charming medicine in [[philosophy]]; for of all the
rest we are sensible of no [[pleasure]] till after the cure: this pleases and
heals at once.”  this is what seneca says, that has carried me from my
subject, but there is advantage in the [[change]].




chapter xxvi

of thumbs

tacitus reports, that amongst [[certain]] barbarian kings [[king]] their manner was,
when they would make a firm obligation, to join their [[right]] hands close
to one another, and intertwist their thumbs; and when, by [[force]] of
straining the [[blood]], it appeared in the ends, they lightly pricked them
with some sharp instrument, and mutually sucked them.

physicians say that the thumbs are the master fingers of the hand, and
that their latin etymology is derived from “pollere.” the greeks [[greek]] called
them ‘avtixeip’, as who should say, another hand.  and it seems that the
latins also sometimes take it in this sense for the whole hand:

              “sed nec vocibus excitata blandis,
               molli pollici nec rogata, surgit.”

          [“neither to be excited by soft words or by the thumb.”
           --mart., xii. 98, 8.]

it was at [[rome]] a signification of favour to depress and turn in the
thumbs:

          “fautor utroque tuum laudabit pollice ludum:”

          [“thy patron will applaud thy [[sport]] with both thumbs”
           --horace.]

and of disfavour to elevate and thrust them outward:

                         “converso pollice vulgi,
                    quemlibet occidunt populariter.”

          [“the populace, with inverted thumbs, kill all that
          come before them.”--juvenal, iii. 36]

the romans exempted from [[war]] all such as were maimed in the thumbs, as
having no more sufficient [[strength]] to hold their [[weapons]].  augustus
confiscated the estate of a roman knight who had maliciously cut off the
thumbs of two [[young]] [[children]] he had, to excuse them from going into the
armies; and, before him, the senate, in the [[time]] of the italic [[war]], had
condemned caius vatienus to perpetual imprisonment, and confiscated all
his goods [[good]], for having purposely cut off the thumb of his left hand, to
exempt himself from that expedition.  some one, i have forgotten who,
having won a naval [[battle]], cut off the thumbs of all his vanquished
enemies, to render them incapable of fighting and of handling the oar.
the athenians also caused the thumbs of the aeginatans to be cut off,
to deprive them of the superiority in the art [[arts]] of navigation.

in lacedaemon, pedagogues chastised their scholars by biting their
thumbs.




chapter xxvii

cowardice the [[mother]] of cruelty

i have often heard it said that cowardice is the [[mother]] of [[cruelty]]; and i
have found by [[experience]] that malicious and inhuman animosity and
fierceness are usually accompanied with feminine weakness.  i have seen
the most cruel [[people]], and upon frivolous occasions [[occasion]], apt to cry.
alexander, the [[tyrant]] of pheres, durst not be a spectator of tragedies in
the theatre, for [[fear]] lest his [[citizens]] should see him weep at the
misfortunes of hecuba and andromache, who himself without [[pity]] caused so
many [[people]] every day to be murdered.  is it not meanness of spirit that
renders them so pliable to all extremities?  valour, whose effect is only
to be exercised against resistance--

          “nec nisi bellantis gaudet cervice juvenci”--

          [“nor delights in killing a bull unless he resists.”
           --claudius, ep. ad hadrianum, v. 39.]

stops when it sees the [[enemy]] at its [[mercy]]; but pusillanimity, to say that
it was also in the game, not having dared to meddle in the first act of
danger, takes as its part the second, of [[blood]] and massacre.  the murders
in victories [[victory]] are commonly performed by the rascality and hangers-on of an
army, and that which causes so many unheard of cruelties in domestic wars
is, that this canaille makes [[war]] in imbruing itself up to the elbows in
blood, and ripping up a [[body]] that lies [[lie]] prostrate at its feet, having no
sense of any other valour:

         “et lupus, et turpes instant morientibus ursi,
          et quaecunque minor nobilitate fera est:”

     [“wolves and the filthy bears, and all the baser beasts,
     fall upon the dying.”--ovid, trist., iii. 5, 35.]

like cowardly dogs, that in the house worry and tear the skins of wild
beasts, they durst not come near in the field.  what is it in these times
of ours that makes our quarrels mortal; and that, whereas our fathers [[father]] had
some degrees [[degree]] of [[revenge]], we now begin with the [[last]] in ours, and at the
first meeting nothing is to be said but, kill?  what is this but
cowardice?

every one is sensible that there is more bravery and disdain in subduing
an [[enemy]], than in cutting, his throat; and in making him yield, than in
putting him to the [[sword]]: besides that the appetite of [[revenge]] is better
satisfied and pleased because its only aim is to make itself [[felt]]: and
this is the [[reason]] why we do not fall upon a beast or a stone when they
hurt us, because they are not capable of being sensible of our [[revenge]];
and to kill a [[man]] is to save him from the injury and offence we intend
him.  and as bias cried out to a wicked fellow, “i [[know]] that sooner or
later thou wilt have thy [[reward]], but i am afraid i shall not see it”;
--[plutarch, on the delay in [[divine]] [[justice]], c. 2.]--and pitied the
orchomenians that the penitence of lyciscus for the [[treason]] committed
against them, came at a season when there was no one remaining alive of
those who had been interested in the offence, and whom the [[pleasure]] of
this penitence should affect: so [[revenge]] is to be pitied, when the person
on whom it is executed is deprived of means of suffering under it: for as
the avenger will look on to enjoy the [[pleasure]] of his [[revenge]], so the
person on whom he takes [[revenge]] should be a spectator too, to be
afflicted and to repent.  “he will repent it,” we say, and because we
have given him a pistol-shot through the head, do we imagine he will
repent?  on the contrary, if we but observe, we shall find, that he makes
mouths at us in falling, and is so far from penitency, that he does not
so much as repine at us; and we do him the kindest office of [[life]], which
is to make him [[die]] insensibly, and soon: we are afterwards to hide
ourselves, and to shift and fly from the officers of [[justice]], who pursue
us, whilst he is at rest.  killing is [[good]] to frustrate an offence to
come, not to [[revenge]] one that is already [[past]]; and more an act of fear
than of bravery; of precaution than of [[courage]]; of defence than of
enterprise.  it is manifest that by it we lose both the true end of
revenge and the [[care]] of our [[reputation]]; we are afraid, if he lives [[life]] he
will do us another injury as [[great]] as the first; ‘tis not out of
animosity to him, but [[care]] of thyself, that thou gettest rid of him.

in the [[kingdom]] of narsingah this expedient would be useless to us, where
not only soldiers, but tradesmen also, end their differences by the
sword.  the [[king]] never denies the field to any who [[wish]] to [[fight]]; and
when they are persons [[person]] of quality; he looks on, rewarding the victor with
a chain of gold,--for which any one who pleases may [[fight]] with him again,
so that, by having come off from one combat, he has engaged himself in
many.

if we [[thought]] by [[virtue]] to be always masters of our enemies [[enemy]], and to
triumph over them at [[pleasure]], we should be [[sorry]] they should escape from
us as they do, by dying: but we have a [[mind]] to conquer, more with safety
than [[honour]], and, in our quarrel, more pursue the end than the [[glory]].

asnius pollio, who, as being a worthy [[man]], was the less to be excused,
committed a like, error, when, having written a libel against plancus, he
forbore to publish it till he was [[dead]]; which is to bite one’s thumb at a
blind [[man]], to rail at one who is deaf, to wound a [[man]] who has no feeling,
rather than to run the hazard of his resentment.  and it was also said of
him that it was only for hobgoblins to wrestle with the [[dead]].

he who stays to see the author [[die]], whose writings he intends to
question, what does he say but that he is [[weak]] in his aggressiveness?
it was told to [[aristotle]] that some one had spoken ill of him: “let him
do more,” said he; “let him whip me too, provided i am not there.”

our fathers [[father]] contented themselves with revenging an insult with the [[lie]],
the [[lie]] with a box of the ear, and so forward; they were valiant enough
not to [[fear]] their adversaries, living and provoked we tremble for [[fear]] so
soon as we see them on foot.  and that this is so, does not our noble
practice of these days, equally to prosecute to [[death]] both him that has
offended us and him we have offended, make it out?  ‘tis also a kind
of cowardice that has introduced the custom of having seconds, thirds,
and fourths in our duels; they were formerly duels; they are now
skirmishes, rencontres, and battles [[battle]].  solitude was, doubtless, terrible
to those who were the first inventors of this practice:

               “quum in se cuique minimum fiduciae esset,”

for naturally any company whatever is consolatory in danger.  third
persons were formerly called in to prevent disorder and foul play only,
and to be witness of the [[fortune]] of the combat; but now they have brought
it to this pass that the witnesses themselves engage; whoever is invited
cannot handsomely stand by as an idle spectator, for [[fear]] of being
suspected either of want of affection or of [[courage]].  besides the
injustice and unworthiness of such an action, of engaging other strength
and valour in the protection of your [[honour]] than your own, i conceive it
a disadvantage to a brave [[man]], and who wholly relies upon himself, to
shuffle his [[fortune]] with that of a second; every one runs hazard enough
himself without hazarding for another, and has enough to do to assure
himself in his own valour for the defence of his [[life]], without intrusting
a thing so dear in a third man’s hand.  for, if it be not expressly
agreed upon before to the contrary, ‘tis a combined party of all four,
and if your second be killed, you have two to deal withal, with good
reason; and to say that it is foul play, it is so indeed, as it is, well
armed, to attack a [[man]] who has but the hilt of a broken [[sword]] in his
hand, or, clear and untouched, a [[man]] who is desperately wounded: but if
these be advantages you have got by fighting, you may make use of them
without reproach.  the disparity and inequality are only weighed and
considered from the condition of the combatants when they began; as to
the rest, you must take your [[chance]]: and though you had, alone, three
enemies upon you at once, your two companions being killed, you have no
more [[wrong]] done you, than i should do in a [[battle]], by running a man
through whom i should see engaged with one of our own [[men]], with the like
advantage.  the [[nature]] of [[society]] will have it so that where there is
troop against troop, as where our duke of orleans challenged henry, king
of [[england]], a hundred against a hundred; three hundred against as many,
as the argians against the lacedaemonians; three to three, as the horatii
against the curiatii, the multitude on either side is considered but as
one [[single]] [[man]]: the hazard, wherever there is company, being confused and
mixed.

i have a domestic interest in this discourse; for my [[brother]], the sieur
de mattecoulom, was at [[rome]] [[asked]] by a gentleman with whom he had no
great acquaintance, and who was a defendant challenged by another, to be
his second; in this duel he found himself matched with a gentleman much
better known to him.  (i would fain have an explanation of these rules [[rule]] of
honour, which so often shock and confound those of [[reason]].)  after having
despatched his [[man]], seeing the two principals still on foot and sound, he
ran in to disengage his friend.  what could he do less? should he have
stood still, and if [[chance]] would have ordered it so, have seen him he was
come thither to defend killed before his face? what he had hitherto done
helped not the [[business]]; the quarrel was yet undecided.  the courtesy
that you can, and certainly ought to shew to your [[enemy]], when you have
reduced him to an ill condition and have a [[great]] advantage over him, i do
not see how you can do it, where the interest of another is concerned,
where you are only called in as an assistant, and the quarrel is none of
yours: he could neither be just nor courteous, at the hazard of him he
was there to serve.  and he was therefore enlarged from the prisons of
italy at the speedy and solemn request of our [[king]].  indiscreet nation!
we are not content to make our vices [[vice]] and follies known to the [[world]] by
report only, but we must go into [[foreign]] countries [[country]], there to show them
what fools [[fool]] we are.  put three frenchmen into the deserts of libya, they
will not [[live]] a month together without fighting; so that you would say
this peregrination were a thing purposely designed to give foreigners the
pleasure of our tragedies, and, for the most part, to such as rejoice and
laugh at our miseries.  we go into [[italy]] to learn to fence, and exercise
the art [[arts]] at the expense of our lives [[life]] before we have learned it; and yet,
by the [[rule]] of discipline, we should put the theory before the practice.
we discover ourselves to be but learners:

              “primitae juvenum miserae, bellique futuri
               dura rudimenta.”

     [“wretched the elementary trials of [[youth]], and hard the
     rudiments of approaching [[war]].”--virgil, aeneid, xi. 156.]

i [[know]] that fencing is an art [[arts]] very useful to its end (in a duel betwixt
two princes [[prince]], cousin-germans, in [[spain]], the elder, says livy, by his skill
and dexterity in arms, easily overcoming the greater and more awkward
strength of the younger), and of which the [[knowledge]], as i experimentally
know, has inspired some with [[courage]] above their [[natural]] measure; but
this is not properly valour, because it supports itself upon address, and
is founded upon something besides itself.  the [[honour]] of combat consists
in the [[jealousy]] of [[courage]], and not of [[skill]]; and therefore i have known
a friend of mine, famed as a [[great]] master in this exercise, in his
quarrels make [[choice]] of such arms as might deprive him of this advantage
and that wholly depended upon [[fortune]] and assurance, that they might not
attribute his [[victory]] rather to his [[skill]] in fencing than his valour.
when i was [[young]], gentlemen avoided the [[reputation]] of [[good]] fencers as
injurious to them, and learned to fence with all imaginable privacy as a
trade of subtlety, derogating from true and [[natural]] valour:

              “non schivar non parar, non ritirarsi,
               voglion costor, ne qui destrezza ha parte;
               non danno i colpi or finti, or pieni, or scarsi!
               toglie l’ira a il furor l’uso de l’arte.
               odi le spade orribilmente utarsi
               a mezzo il ferro; il pie d’orma non parte,
               sempre a il pie fermo, a la [[man]] sempre in moto;
               ne scende taglio in van, ne punta a voto.”

          [“they neither shrank, nor vantage sought of ground,
          they travers’d not, nor skipt from part to part,
          their blows were neither false, nor feigned found:
          in [[fight]], their rage would let them use no art [[arts]].
          their swords [[sword]] together clash with dreadful sound,
          their feet stand fast, and neither stir nor start,
          they move their hands, steadfast their feet remain.
          nor blow nor foin they strook, or thrust in [[vain]].”
           --tasso, gierus.  lib., c. 12, st. 55, fairfax’s translation.]

butts, tilting, and barriers, the feint of warlike fights, were the
exercises of our forefathers: this other exercise is so much the less
noble, as it only respects [[respect]] a private end; that teaches [[teach]] us to [[destroy]] one
another against [[law]] and [[justice]], and that every way always produces [[produce]] very
ill effects.  it is much more worthy and more becoming to exercise
ourselves in things that strengthen than that weaken our [[government]] and
that tend to the [[public]] safety and [[common]] [[glory]].  the consul, publius
rutilius,  was the first who taught the soldiers to handle their arms
with [[skill]], and joined art [[arts]] with valour, not for the rise of private
quarrel, but for [[war]] and the quarrels of the [[people]] of [[rome]]; a popular
and civil defence.  and besides the [[example]] of caesar,  who commanded his
men to shoot chiefly at the face of pompey’s soldiers in the [[battle]] of
pharsalia, a thousand other commanders have also bethought them to invent
new forms of [[weapons]] and new ways of striking and defending, according as
occasion should require.

but as philopoemen condemned wrestling, wherein he excelled, because the
preparatives that were therein employed were differing from those that
appertain to [[military]] discipline, to which alone he conceived [[men]] of
honour ought wholly to apply themselves; so it seems to me that this
address to which we form our limbs, those writhings and motions [[young]] men
are taught in this new school, are not only of no use, but rather
contrary and hurtful to the practice of [[fight]] in [[battle]]; and also our
people commonly make use of particular [[weapons]], and peculiarly designed
for duel; and i have seen, when it has been disapproved, that a gentleman
challenged to [[fight]] with rapier and poignard appeared in the array of a
man-at-arms, and that another should take his cloak instead of his
poignard.  it is worthy of consideration that laches in [[plato]], speaking
of learning to fence after our manner, says that he never knew any great
soldier come out of that school, especially the masters of it: and,
indeed, as to them, our [[experience]] tells as much.  as to the rest, we may
at least conclude that they are qualities of no relation or
correspondence; and in the [[education]] of the [[children]] of his [[government]],
plato interdicts the art [[arts]] of boxing, introduced by amycus and epeius, and
that of wrestling, by antaeus and cercyo, because they have another end
than to render [[youth]] fit for the service of [[war]] and contribute nothing to
it.  but i see that i have somewhat strayed from my theme.

the [[emperor]] mauricius, being advertised by dreams [[dream]] and several
prognostics, that one phocas, an obscure soldier, should kill him,
questioned his son-in-law, philip, who this phocas was, and what were his
nature, qualities, and manners; and so soon as philip, amongst other
things, had told him that he was cowardly and timorous, the emperor
immediately concluded then that he was a murderer and cruel.  what is it
that makes tyrants [[tyrant]] so sanguinary?  ‘tis only the solicitude for their own
safety, and that their faint hearts [[heart]] can furnish them with no other means
of securing themselves than in exterminating those who may hurt them,
even so much as [[women]], for [[fear]] of a scratch:

               “cuncta ferit, dum cuncta timer.”

               [“he strikes at all who fears [[fear]] all.”
                --claudius, in eutrop., i. 182.]

the first cruelties are exercised for themselves thence springs the fear
of a just [[revenge]], which afterwards produces [[produce]] a series of new cruelties,
to obliterate one another.  philip, [[king]] of macedon, who had so much to
do with the [[people]] of [[rome]], agitated with the [[horror]] of so many murders
committed by his order, and doubting of being able to keep himself secure
from so many families [[family]], at divers times [[time]] mortally injured and offended by
him, resolved to seize all the [[children]] of those he had caused to be
slain, to despatch them daily one after another, and so to establish his
own repose.

fine matter is never impertinent, however placed; and therefore i, who
more consider the weight and utility of what i deliver than its order and
connection, need not [[fear]] in this place to bring in an excellent story,
though it be a little by-the-by; for when they are [[rich]] in their own
native [[beauty]], and are able to justify themselves, the least end of a
hair will serve to draw them into my discourse.

amongst others condemned by philip, had been one herodicus, [[prince]] of
thessaly; he had, moreover, after him caused his two sons-in-law to be
put to [[death]], each leaving a [[son]] very [[young]] behind him.  theoxena and
archo were their two widows.  theoxena, though highly courted to it,
could not be persuaded to [[marry]] again: archo [[married]] poris, the greatest
man among the aenians, and by him had a [[great]] many [[children]], whom she,
dying, left at a very tender [[age]].  theoxena, moved with a maternal
charity towards her nephews, that she might have them under her own eyes
and in her own protection, [[married]] poris: when presently comes a
proclamation of the king’s edict.  this brave-spirited [[mother]], suspecting
the [[cruelty]] of philip, and afraid of the insolence of the soldiers
towards these charming and tender [[children]] was so bold as to declare hat
she would rather kill them with her own hands than deliver them.  poris,
startled at this protestation, promised her to steal them away, and to
transport them to [[athens]], and there commit them to the custody of some
faithful [[friends]] of his.  they took, therefore, the opportunity of an
annual feast which was celebrated at aenia in [[honour]] of [[aeneas]], and
thither they went.  having appeared by day at the [[public]] ceremonies [[ceremony]] and
banquet, they stole the night following into a vessel laid ready for the
purpose, to escape away by sea.  the wind proved contrary, and finding
themselves in the morning within sight of the [[land]] whence they had
launched overnight, and being pursued by the guards of the port, poris
perceiving this, laboured all he could to make the mariners do their
utmost to escape from the pursuers.  but theoxena, frantic with affection
and [[revenge]], in pursuance of her former resolution, prepared both weapons
and poison, and exposing them before them; “go to, my [[children]],” said
she, “death is now the only means of your defence and [[liberty]], and shall
administer [[occasion]] to the gods to exercise their [[sacred]] [[justice]]: these
sharp swords [[sword]], and these full cups, will open you the way into it;
courage, [[fear]] nothing!  and thou, my [[son]], who art [[arts]] the eldest, take this
steel into thy hand, that thou mayest the more bravely [[die]].”  the
children having on one side so powerful a counsellor, and the [[enemy]] at
their throats on the other, run all of them eagerly upon what was next to
hand; and, half [[dead]], were thrown into the sea.  theoxena, proud of
having so gloriously provided for the safety of her [[children]], clasping
her arms with [[great]] affection about her husband’s neck.  “let us, my
friend,” said she, “follow these boys, and enjoy the same sepulchre they
do”; and so, having embraced, they threw themselves headlong into the
sea; so that the ship was carried--back without the owners into the
harbour.

tyrants, at once both to kill and to make their anger [[felt]], have employed
their capacity to invent the most lingering deaths [[death]].  they will have their
enemies despatched, but not so fast that they may not have leisure to
taste their vengeance.  and therein they are mightily perplexed; for if
the torments they inflict are [[violent]], they are short; if long, they are
not then so painful as they [[desire]]; and thus plague themselves in choice
of the [[greatest]] [[cruelty]].  of this we have a thousand examples [[example]] in
antiquity, and i [[know]] not whether we, unawares, do not retain some traces
of this barbarity.

all that exceeds a simple [[death]] appears to me absolute [[cruelty]].  our
justice cannot expect that he, whom the [[fear]] of dying by being beheaded
or [[hanged]] will not restrain, should be any more awed by the imagination
of a languishing [[fire]], pincers, or the wheel.  and i [[know]] not, in the
meantime, whether we do not throw them into despair; for in what
condition can be the [[soul]] of a [[man]], expecting four-and-twenty hours
together to be broken upon a wheel, or after the old way, nailed to a
cross?  josephus relates that in the [[time]] of the [[war]] the romans made in
judaea, happening to pass by where they had three days before crucified
certain [[jews]], he amongst them knew three of his own [[friends]], and obtained
the favour of having them taken down, of whom two, he says, died; the
third lived a [[great]] while after.

chalcondylas, a writer of [[good]] credit, in the records he has left behind
him of things that happened in his [[time]], and near him, tells us, as of
the most excessive torment, of that the [[emperor]] mohammed very often
practised, of cutting off [[men]] in the middle by the diaphragm with one
blow of a scimitar, whence it followed that they died as it were two
deaths at once; and both the one part, says he, and the other, were seen
to stir and strive a [[great]] while after in very [[great]] torment.  i do not
think there was any [[great]] suffering in this motion the torments that are
the most dreadful to look on are not always the [[greatest]] to endure; and i
find those that other historians relate to have been practised by him
upon the epirot lords [[lord]], are more horrid and cruel, where they were
condemned to be flayed alive piecemeal, after so malicious a manner that
they continued fifteen days in that misery.

and these other two: croesus, having caused a gentleman, the favourite of
his [[brother]] pantaleon, to be seized, carried him into a fuller’s shop,
where he caused him to be scratched and carded with the cards and combs
belonging to that [[trade]], till he died.  george sechel, [[chief]] commander of
the peasants of poland, who committed so many mischiefs under the title
of the crusade, being defeated in [[battle]] and taken bu the vayvode of
transylvania, was three days bound naked upon the rack exposed to all
sorts of torments that any one could contrive against him: during which
time many other prisoners [[prisoner]] were kept fasting; in the end, he living and
looking on, they made his beloved [[brother]] lucat, for whom alone he
entreated, taking on himself the blame of all their [[evil]] actions drink
his [[blood]], and caused twenty of his most favoured captains to feed upon
him, tearing his flesh in pieces with their teeth, and swallowing the
morsels.  the remainder of his [[body]] and his bowels, so soon as he was
dead, were boiled, and others of his followers compelled to [[eat]] them.




chapter xxviii

all things have their season

such as compare cato the censor with the younger cato, who killed
himself, compare two beautiful natures [[nature]], much resembling one another.
the first acquired his [[reputation]] several ways, and excels in military
exploits and the utility of his [[public]] employments; but the [[virtue]] of the
younger, besides that it were blasphemy to compare any to it in vigour,
was much more pure and unblemished.  for who could absolve that of the
censor from envy and [[ambition]], having dared to attack the [[honour]] of
scipio, a [[man]] in goodness and all other excellent qualities infinitely
beyond him or any other of his [[time]]?

that which they, report of him, amongst other things, that in his extreme
old [[age]] he put himself upon learning the [[greek]] tongue with so greedy an
appetite, as if to quench a long thirst, does not seem to me to make much
for his [[honour]]; it being properly what we call falling into second
childhood.  all things have their seasons, even [[good]] ones, and i may say
my paternoster out of [[time]]; as they accused t. quintus flaminius, that
being general of an [[army]], he was seen praying apart in the [[time]] of a
battle that he won.

          “imponit finem sapiens et rebus honestis.”

     [“the [[wise]] [[man]] limits even honest things.”--juvenal, vi. 444]

eudemonidas, seeing xenocrates when very old, still very intent upon his
school lectures: “when will this [[man]] be [[wise]],” said he, “if he is yet
learning?”  and philopaemen, to those who extolled [[king]] ptolemy for every
day inuring his [[person]] to the exercise of arms: “it is not,” said he,
“commendable in a [[king]] of his [[age]] to exercise himself in these things; he
ought now really to employ them.”  the [[young]] are to make their
preparations, the old to enjoy them, say the sages: and the [[greatest]] vice
they observe in us is that our desires [[desire]] incessantly grow [[young]] again; we
are always re-beginning to [[live]].

our studies and desires [[desire]] should sometime be sensible of [[age]]; yet we have
one foot in the grave and still our appetites and pursuits spring every
day anew within us:

                   “tu secanda marmora
                    locas sub ipsum funus, et, sepulcri
                    immemor, struis domos.”

     [“you against the [[time]] of [[death]] have marble cut for use, and,
     forgetful of the tomb, build houses.”--horace, od., ii. 18, 17.]

the longest of my designs is not of above a year’s extent; i [[think]] of
nothing now but ending; rid myself of all new hopes [[hope]] and enterprises; take
my [[last]] leave of every place i depart from, and every day dispossess
myself of what i have.

          “olim jam nec perit quicquam mihi, nec acquiritur....
          plus superest viatici quam viae.”

     [“henceforward i will neither lose, nor expect to get: i have more
     wherewith to defray my [[journey]], than i have way to go.”  (or):
     “hitherto nothing of me has been lost or gained; more remains to pay
     the way than there is way.”--seneca, ep., 77.  (the sense seems to
     be that so far he had met his expenses, but that for the future he
     was likely to have more than he required.)]

          “vixi, et, quem dederat cursum fortuna, peregi.”

     [“i have lived and finished the [[career]] [[fortune]] placed before me.”
      --aeneid, iv. 653.]

‘tis indeed the only comfort i find in my old [[age]], that it mortifies in
me several cares [[care]] and desires [[desire]] wherewith my [[life]] has been disturbed; the
care how the [[world]] goes, the [[care]] of riches [[rich]], of grandeur, of [[knowledge]],
of health, of myself.  there are [[men]] who are learning to speak at a time
when they should learn to be silent for ever.  a [[man]] may always study,
but he must not always go to school what a contemptible thing is an old
abecedarian!--[seneca, ep. 36]

              “diversos diversa juvant; non omnibus annis
               omnia conveniunt.”

          [“various things delight various [[men]]; all things are not
          for all ages [[age]].”--gall., eleg., i. 104.]

if we must study, let us study what is suitable to our [[present]] condition,
that we may [[answer]] as he did, who being [[asked]] to what end he [[studied]] in
his decrepit [[age]], “that i may go out [[better]],” said he, “and at greater
ease.”  such a study was that of the younger cato, feeling his end
approach, and which he met with in plato’s discourse of the eternity of
the [[soul]]: not, as we are to [[believe]], that he was not long before
furnished with all sorts of provision for such a departure; for of
assurance, an established will and instruction, he had more than plato
had in all his writings; his [[knowledge]] and [[courage]] were in this respect
above [[philosophy]]; he applied himself to this study, not for the service
of his [[death]]; but, as a [[man]] whose sleeps were never disturbed in the
importance of such a deliberation, he also, without [[choice]] or [[change]],
continued his studies with the other accustomary actions of his [[life]].
the night that he was denied the praetorship he spent in play; that
wherein he was to [[die]] he spent in reading.  the loss either of life
or of office was all one to him.




chapter xxix

of virtue

i find by [[experience]], that there is a [[good]] deal to be said betwixt the
flights and emotions of the [[soul]] or a resolute and constant habit; and
very well perceive that there is nothing we may not do, nay, even to the
surpassing the divinity itself, says a [[certain]] [[person]], forasmuch as it is
more to render a man’s [[self]] impassible by his own study and industry,
than to be so by his [[natural]] condition; and even to be able to conjoin to
man’s imbecility and frailty a god-like resolution and assurance; but it
is by fits and starts; and in the lives [[life]] of those heroes of times [[time]] past
there are sometimes miraculous impulses, and that seem infinitely to
exceed our [[natural]] [[force]]; but they are indeed only impulses: and ‘tis
hard to [[believe]], that these so elevated qualities in a [[man]] can so
thoroughly tinct and imbue the [[soul]] that they should become ordinary,
and, as it were, [[natural]] in him.  it accidentally happens even to us,
who are but abortive births of [[men]], sometimes to launch our souls [[soul]], when
roused by the discourses or examples [[example]] of others, much beyond their
ordinary stretch; but ‘tis a [[kind]] of passion which pushes and agitates
them, and in some sort ravishes them from themselves: but, this
perturbation once overcome, we see that they insensibly flag and slacken
of themselves, if not to the lowest [[degree]], at least so as to be no more
the same; insomuch as that upon every trivial [[occasion]], the losing of a
bird, or the breaking, of a glass, we suffer ourselves to be moved little
less than one of the [[common]] [[people]].  i am of [[opinion]], that order,
moderation, and constancy excepted, all things are to be done by a man
that is very imperfect and defective in general.  therefore it is, say
the sages, that to make a [[right]] [[judgment]] of a [[man]], you are chiefly to pry
into his [[common]] actions, and surprise him in his everyday habit.

pyrrho, he who erected so pleasant a [[knowledge]] upon ignorance,
endeavoured, as all the rest who were really [[philosophers]] did, to make
his [[life]] correspond with his doctrine.  and because he maintained the
imbecility of [[human]] [[judgment]] to be so extreme as to be incapable of any
choice or inclination, and would have it perpetually wavering and
suspended, considering and receiving all things as indifferent, ‘tis
said, that he always comforted himself after the same manner and
countenance: if he had begun a discourse, he would always end what he had
to say, though the [[person]] he was speaking to had gone away: if he walked,
he never stopped for any impediment that stood in his way, being
preserved from precipices, collision with carts, and other like
accidents, by the [[care]] of his [[friends]]: for, to [[fear]] or to avoid anything,
had been to shock his own propositions, which deprived the senses
themselves of all election and certainty.  sometimes he [[suffered]] incision
and cauteries with so [[great]] constancy as never to be seen so much as to
wince.  ‘tis something to bring the [[soul]] to these imaginations [[imagination]]; ‘tis more
to join the effects, and yet not impossible; but to conjoin them with
such perseverance and constancy as to make them habitual, is certainly,
in attempts so remote from the [[common]] usage, almost incredible to be
done.  therefore it was, that being sometime taken in his house sharply
scolding with his sister, and being reproached that he therein
transgressed his own rules [[rule]] of indifference: “what!” said he, “must this
bit of a woman also serve for a testimony to my rules [[rule]]?”  another [[time]],
being seen to defend himself against a dog: “it is,” said he, “very hard
totally to put off [[man]]; and we must endeavour and [[force]] ourselves to
resist and encounter things, first by effects, but at least by [[reason]] and
argument.”

about seven or eight years since, a husbandman yet living, but two
leagues from my house, having long been tormented with his wife’s
jealousy, coming one day [[home]] from his [[work]], and she welcoming him with
her accustomed railing, entered into so [[great]] fury that with a sickle he
had yet in his hand, he totally cut off all those parts that she was
jealous of and threw them in her face.  and, ‘tis said that a young
gentleman of our nation, brisk and amorous, having by his perseverance at
last mollified the [[heart]] of a [[fair]] mistress, enraged, that upon the point
of fruition he found himself unable to perform, and that,

                         “nec viriliter
          iners senile penis extulit caput.”

     [(the 19th or 20th century translators leave this phrase
     untranslated and with no explanation. d.w.)
     --tibullus, priap.  carm., 84.]

as soon as ever he came [[home]] he deprived himself of the rebellious
member, and sent it to his mistress, a cruel and bloody victim for the
expiation of his offence.  if this had been done upon mature
consideration, and upon the account of [[religion]], as the priests [[priest]] of cybele
did, what should we say of so high an action?

a few days since, at bergerac, five leagues from my house, up the river
dordogne, a woman having overnight been beaten and abused by her husband,
a choleric ill-conditioned fellow, resolved to escape from his ill-usage
at the price of her [[life]]; and going so soon as she was up the next
morning to visit her neighbours, as she was wont to do, and having let
some words fall in recommendation of her affairs, she took a sister of
hers by the hand, and [[led]] her to the bridge; whither being come, and
having taken leave of her, in jest as it were, without any manner of
alteration in her countenance, she threw herself headlong from the top
into the river, and was there drowned.  that which is the most remarkable
in this is, that this resolution was a whole night forming in her head.

it is quite another thing with the [[indian]] [[women]] for it being the custom
there for the [[men]] to have many wives [[wife]], and the [[best]] beloved of them to
kill herself at her husband’s decease, every one of them makes it the
business of her whole [[life]] to obtain this [[privilege]] and gain this
advantage over her companions; and the [[good]] offices they do their
husbands aim at no other recompense but to be preferred in accompanying
him in [[death]]:

              “ubi mortifero jacta est fax ultima lecto,
               uxorum fusis stat pia turba comis
               et certamen habent lethi, quae viva sequatur
               conjugium: pudor est non licuisse mori.
               ardent victrices, et flammae pectora praebent,
               imponuntque suis ora perusta viris.”

     [“for when they threw the torch on the [[funeral]] bed, the pious wives
     with hair dishevelled, stand around striving, which, living, shall
     accompany her spouse; and are ashamed that they may not [[die]]; they
     who are preferred expose their breasts to the flame, and they lay
     their scorched lips on those of their husbands.”
      --propertius, iii. 13, 17.]

a [[certain]] author of our times [[time]] reports that he has seen in those oriental
nations this custom in practice, that not only the wives [[wife]] bury themselves
with their husbands, but even the slaves [[slave]] he has enjoyed also; which is
done after this manner: the husband being [[dead]], the widow may if she will
(but few will) demand two or three months’ respite wherein to order her
affairs.  the day being come, she mounts on horseback, dressed as fine as
at her wedding, and with a cheerful countenance says she is going to
sleep with her spouse, holding a looking-glass in her left hand and an
arrow in the other.  being thus conducted in pomp, accompanied with her
kindred and [[friends]] and a [[great]] concourse of [[people]] in [[great]] joy, she is
at [[last]] brought to the [[public]] place appointed for such spectacles: this
is a [[great]] space, in the midst of which is a pit full of wood, and
adjoining to it a mount raised four or five steps, upon which she is
brought and served with a magnificent repast; which being done, she falls
to dancing and singing, and gives order, when she thinks [[think]] fit, to kindle
the [[fire]].  this being done, she descends, and taking the nearest of her
husband’s relations by the hand, they walk to the river close by, where
she strips herself stark naked, and having distributed her clothes and
jewels to her [[friends]], plunges herself into the water, as if there to
cleanse herself from her sins [[sin]]; coming out thence, she wraps herself in a
yellow linen of five-and-twenty ells long, and again giving her hand to
this kinsman of her husband’s, they return back to the mount, where she
makes a [[speech]] to the [[people]], and recommends her [[children]] to them, if she
have any.  betwixt the pit and the mount there is commonly a curtain
drawn to screen the burning furnace from their sight, which some of them,
to manifest the greater [[courage]], forbid.  having ended what she has to
say, a woman presents [[present]] her with a vessel of [[oil]], wherewith to anoint her
head and her whole [[body]], which when done with she throws into the [[fire]],
and in an instant precipitates herself after.  immediately, the people
throw a [[good]] many billets and logs upon her that she may not be long in
dying, and convert all their joy into [[sorrow]] and mourning.  if they are
persons of meaner condition, the [[body]] of the defunct is carried to the
place of sepulture, and there placed sitting, the widow kneeling before
him, embracing the [[dead]] [[body]]; and they continue in this posture whilst
the [[people]] build a wall about them, which so soon as it is raised to the
height of the woman’s shoulders, one of her relations comes behind her,
and taking hold of her head, twists her neck; so soon as she is [[dead]], the
wall is presently raised up, and closed, and there they remain entombed.

there was, in this same [[country]], something like this in their
gymnosophists; for not by constraint of others nor by the impetuosity of
a sudden [[humour]], but by the express profession of their order, their
custom was, as soon as they arrived at a [[certain]] [[age]], or that they saw
themselves threatened by any disease, to cause a [[funeral]] pile to be
erected for them, and on the top a stately bed, where, after having
joyfully feasted their [[friends]] and acquaintance, they laid them down with
so [[great]] resolution, that [[fire]] being applied to it, they were never seen
to stir either hand or foot; and after this manner, one of them, calanus
by name; expired in the presence of the whole [[army]] of alexander the
great.  and he was neither reputed holy nor [[happy]] amongst them who did
not thus [[destroy]] himself, dismissing his [[soul]] purged and purified by the
fire, after having consumed all that was earthly and mortal.  this
constant premeditation of the whole [[life]] is that which makes the wonder.

amongst our other controversies, that of ‘fatum’ has also crept in; and
to tie things to come, and even our own wills, to a [[certain]] and
inevitable necessity, we are yet upon this argument of [[time]] [[past]]:
“since [[god]] foresees that all things shall so fall out, as doubtless he
does, it must then necessarily [[follow]], that they must so fall out”: to
which our masters reply: “that the seeing anything come to pass, as we
do, and as [[god]] himself also does (for all things being [[present]] with him,
he rather sees, than foresees), is not to compel an event: that is, we
see because things do fall out, but things do not fall out because we
see: events cause [[knowledge]], but [[knowledge]] does not cause events.  that
which we see happen, does happen; but it might have happened otherwise:
and [[god]], in the catalogue of the causes of events which he has in his
prescience, has also those which we call accidental and voluntary,
depending upon the [[liberty]].  he has given our [[free]] will, and knows [[know]] that
we do amiss because we would do so.”

i have seen a [[great]] many commanders encourage their soldiers with this
fatal necessity; for if our [[time]] be limited to a [[certain]] hour, neither
the enemies’ shot nor our own boldness, nor our flight and cowardice,
can either shorten or prolong our lives [[life]].  this is easily said, but see
who will be so easily persuaded; and if it be so that a [[strong]] and lively
faith draws along with it actions of the same [[kind]], certainly this faith
we so much brag of, is very [[light]] in this [[age]] of ours, unless the
contempt it has of works [[work]] makes it disdain their company.  so it is, that
to this very [[purpose]] the sire de joinville, as credible a witness as any
other whatever, tells us of the bedouins, a nation amongst the saracens,
with whom the [[king]] st. louis had to do in the holy [[land]], that they, in
their [[religion]], so firmly believed the number of every man’s days to be
from all eternity prefixed and set down by an inevitable decree, that
they went naked to the wars [[war]], excepting a turkish [[sword]], and their bodies
only covered with a [[white]] linen cloth: and for the [[greatest]] curse they
could invent when they were angry, this was always in their mouths:
“accursed be thou, as he that arms himself for [[fear]] of [[death]].”  this is a
testimony of [[faith]] very much beyond ours.  and of this sort is that also
that two friars of florence gave in our fathers’ days.  being engaged in
some controversy of learning, they agreed to go both of them into the
fire in the sight of all the [[people]], each for the verification of his
argument, and all things were already prepared, and the thing just upon
the point of execution, when it was interrupted by an unexpected
accident.--[7th april 1498.  savonarola issued the challenge.  after many
delays from demands and counter-demands by each side as to the details of
the [[fire]], both parties found that they had important [[business]] to transact
in another county--both just barely escaped assassination at the hands of
the disappointed spectators.  d.w.]

a [[young]] turkish [[lord]], having performed a notable exploit in his own
person in the sight of both armies [[army]], that of amurath and that of huniades,
ready to join [[battle]], being [[asked]] by amurath, what in such tender and
inexperienced years (for it was his first sally into arms) had inspired
him with so brave a [[courage]], replied, that his [[chief]] tutor for valour was
a hare.  “for being,” said he, “one day a hunting, i found a hare
sitting, and though i had a brace of excellent greyhounds with me, yet
methought it would be [[best]] for sureness to make use of my bow; for she
sat very [[fair]].  i then fell to letting fly my arrows, and shot forty that
i had in my quiver, not only without hurting, but without starting her
from her form.  at [[last]] i slipped my dogs after her, but to no more
purpose than i had shot: by which i understood that she had been secured
by her [[destiny]]; and, that neither darts nor swords [[sword]] can wound without the
permission of [[fate]], which we can neither hasten nor defer.”  this story
may serve, by the way, to let us see how flexible our [[reason]] is to all
sorts of images.

a [[person]] of [[great]] years, name, [[dignity]], and learning boasted to me that
he had been induced to a [[certain]] very important [[change]] in his [[faith]] by a
strange and whimsical incitation, and one otherwise so inadequate, that i
thought it much stronger, taken the contrary way: he called it a miracle,
and so i look upon it, but in a different sense.  the turkish historians
say, that the persuasion those of their nation have imprinted in them of
the fatal and unalterable prescription of their days, manifestly conduces
to the giving them [[great]] assurance in dangers.  and i [[know]] a [[great]] prince
who makes very fortunate use of it, whether it be that he really believes
it, or that he makes it his excuse for so wonderfully hazarding himself:
let us [[hope]] [[fortune]] may not be too soon weary of her favour to him.

there has not happened in our memory a more admirable effect of
resolution than in those two who conspired the [[death]] of the [[prince]] of
orange.

     [the first of these was jehan de jaureguy, who wounded the prince
     18th march 1582; the second, by whom the [[prince]] was killed 10th july
     1584., was balthazar gerard.]

‘tis marvellous how the second who executed it, could ever be persuaded
into an attempt, wherein his companion, who had done his utmost, had had
so ill [[success]]; and after the same method, and with the same arms, to go
attack a [[lord]], armed with so recent a late lesson of distrust, powerful
in followers and bodily [[strength]], in his own hall, amidst his guards, and
in a [[city]] wholly at his devotion.  assuredly, he employed a very resolute
arm and a [[courage]] enflamed with furious passion.  a poignard is surer for
striking [[home]]; but by [[reason]] that more motion and [[force]] of hand is
required than with a pistol, the blow is more [[subject]] to be put by or
hindered.  that this [[man]] did not run to a [[certain]] [[death]], i make no great
doubt; for the hopes [[hope]] any one could flatter him withal, could not find
place in any sober understanding, and the conduct of his exploit
sufficiently manifests that he had no want of that, no more than of
courage.  the motives of so powerful a persuasion may be diverse, for our
fancy does what it will, both with itself and us.  the execution that was
done near orleans--[the murder of the duke of guise by poltrot.]--was
nothing like this; there was in this more of [[chance]] than vigour; the
wound was not mortal, if [[fortune]] had not made it so, and to attempt to
shoot on horseback, and at a [[great]] distance, by one whose [[body]] was in
motion from the motion of his horse, was the attempt of a [[man]] who had
rather miss his blow than fail of saving himself.  this was apparent from
what followed; for he was so astonished and stupefied with the [[thought]] of
so high an execution, that he totally lost his [[judgment]] both to find his
way to flight and to govern his tongue.  what needed he to have done more
than to fly back to his [[friends]] across the river?  ‘tis what i have done
in less dangers, and that i [[think]] of very little hazard, how broad soever
the river may be, provided your horse have easy going in, and that you
see on the other side easy landing according to the stream.  the other,
--[balthazar gerard.]--when they pronounced his dreadful sentence,
“i was prepared for this,” said he, “beforehand, and i will make you
wonder at my patience.”

the assassins, a nation bordering upon phoenicia,

     [or in [[egypt]], syria, and [[persia]].  derivation of ‘assassin’ is from
     hassan-ben-saba, one of their early leaders, and they had an
     existence for some centuries.  they are classed among the secret
     societies [[society]] of the middle ages [[age]].  d.w.]

are reputed amongst the mohammedans a [[people]] of very [[great]] devotion and
purity of manners.  they hold that the nearest way to gain paradise is to
kill some one of a contrary [[religion]]; which is the [[reason]] they have often
been seen, being but one or two, and without armour, to attempt against
powerful enemies [[enemy]], at the price of a [[certain]] [[death]] and without any
consideration of their own danger.  so was our raymond, count of tripoli,
assassinated (which word is derived from their name) in the [[heart]] of his
city,--[in 1151]--during our enterprises of the holy [[war]]: and likewise
conrad, marquis of monteferrat, the murderers at their execution bearing
themselves with [[great]] [[pride]] and [[glory]] that they had performed so brave an
exploit.




chapter xxx.

of a monstrous child

this story shall go by itself; for i will leave it to physicians to
discourse of.  two days ago i saw a child that two [[men]] and a nurse, who
said they were the [[father]], the uncle, and the aunt of it, carried about
to get [[money]] by showing it, by [[reason]] it was so [[strange]] a creature.  it
was, as to all the rest, of a [[common]] form, and could stand upon its feet;
could go and gabble much like other [[children]] of the same [[age]]; it had
never as yet taken any other nourishment but from the nurse’s breasts,
and what, in my presence, they tried to put into the mouth of it, it only
chewed a little and spat it out again without swallowing; the cry of it
seemed indeed a little odd and particular, and it was just fourteen
months old.  under the breast it was joined to another child, but without
a head, and which had the spine of the back without motion, the rest
entire; for though it had one arm shorter than the other, it had been
broken by accident at their birth; they were joined breast to breast, and
as if a lesser child sought to throw its arms about the neck of one
something bigger.  the juncture and thickness of the place where they
were conjoined was not above four fingers, or thereabouts, so that if you
thrust up the imperfect child you might see the navel of the other below
it, and the joining was betwixt the paps and the navel.  the navel of the
imperfect child could not be seen, but all the rest of the belly, so that
all that was not joined of the imperfect one, as arms, buttocks, thighs,
and legs, hung dangling upon the other, and might reach to the mid-leg.
the nurse, moreover, told us that it urined at both bodies [[body]], and that the
members of the other were nourished, sensible, and in the same plight
with that she gave suck to, excepting that they were shorter and less.
this double [[body]] and several limbs relating to one head might be
interpreted a favourable prognostic to the [[king]],--[henry iii.]--of
maintaining these various parts of our [[state]] under the union of his laws [[law]];
but lest the event should prove otherwise, ‘tis [[better]] to let it alone,
for in things already [[past]] there needs no divination,

          “ut quum facts [[fact]] sunt, tum ad conjecturam
          aliqui interpretatione revocentur;”

     [“so as when they are come to pass, they may then by some
     interpretation be recalled to conjecture”
      --cicero, de divin., ii. 31.]

as ‘tis said of epimenides, that he always prophesied backward.

i have just seen a herdsman in medoc, of about thirty years of [[age]], who
has no sign of any genital parts; he has three holes by which he
incessantly voids his water; he is bearded, has [[desire]], and seeks contact
with [[women]].

those that we call monsters are not so to [[god]], who sees in the immensity
of his [[work]] the infinite forms that he has comprehended therein; and it
is to be believed that this figure which astonishes us has relation to
some other figure of the same [[kind]] unknown to [[man]].  from his all wisdom
nothing but [[good]], [[common]]; and regular proceeds; but we do not discern the
disposition and relation:

          “quod crebro videt, non miratur, etiamsi,
          cur fiat, nescit.  quod ante non vidit, id,
          si evenerit, ostentum esse censet.”

     [“what he often sees he does not [[admire]], though he be ignorant how
     it comes to pass.  when a thing happens he never saw before, he
     thinks [[think]] that it is a portent.”--cicero, de divin., ii.  22.]

whatever falls out contrary to custom we say is contrary to [[nature]], but
nothing, whatever it be, is contrary to her.  let, therefore, this
universal and [[natural]] [[reason]] expel the error and astonishment that
novelty brings along with it.




chapter xxxi

of anger

plutarch is admirable throughout, but especially where he judges [[judge]] of human
actions.  what fine things does he say in the comparison of lycurgus and
numa upon the [[subject]] of our [[great]] folly in abandoning [[children]] to the
care and [[government]] of their fathers [[father]]?  the most of our civil governments [[government]],
as [[aristotle]] says, “leave, after the manner of the cyclopes, to every one
the ordering of their wives [[wife]] and [[children]], according to their own foolish
and indiscreet fancy; and the lacedaemonian and cretan are almost the
only governments [[government]] that have committed the [[education]] of [[children]] to the
laws.  who does not see that in a [[state]] all depends upon their nurture
and bringing up? and yet they are left to the [[mercy]] of parents, let them
be as foolish and ill-conditioned as they may, without any manner of
discretion.”

amongst other things, how often have i, as i have passed along our
streets, had a [[good]] [[mind]] to get up a farce, to [[revenge]] the [[poor]] boys whom
i have seen hided, knocked down, and miserably beaten by some [[father]] or
mother, when in their fury and mad with rage?  you shall see them come
out with [[fire]] and fury sparkling in their [[eyes]]:

              “rabie jecur incendente, feruntur,
               praecipites; ut saxa jugis abrupta, quibus mons
               subtrahitur, clivoque latus pendente recedit,”

     [“they are headlong borne with burning fury as [[great]] stones torn
     from the mountains, by which the steep sides are left naked and
     bare.”--juvenal, sat., vi. 647.]

(and according to hippocrates, the most dangerous maladies are they that
disfigure the countenance), with a roaring and terrible voice, very often
against those that are but newly come from nurse, and there they are
lamed and spoiled with blows, whilst our [[justice]] takes no cognisance of
it, as if these maims and dislocations were not executed upon members of
our commonwealth:

         “gratum est, quod patria; civem populoque dedisti,
          si facis, ut patrix sit idoneus, utilis agris,
          utilis et bellorum et pacis rebus agendis.”

     [“it is well when to thy [[country]] and the [[people]] thou hast given a
     citizen, provided thou make fit for his country’s service; useful to
     till the [[earth]], useful in affairs of [[war]] and peace”
      --juvenal, sat., xiv. 70.]

there is no passion that so much transports [[men]] from their [[right]] judgment
as anger.  no one would demur upon punishing a [[judge]] with [[death]] who
should condemn a [[criminal]] on the account of his own choler; why, then,
should fathers [[father]] and pedagogues be any more allowed to whip and chastise
children in their anger?  ‘tis then no longer correction, but [[revenge]].
chastisement is instead of physic to [[children]]; and would we endure a
physician who should be animated against and enraged at his patient?

we ourselves, to do well, should never lay a hand upon our servants
whilst our anger lasts.  when the pulse beats, and we [[feel]] emotion in
ourselves, let us defer the [[business]]; things will indeed appear otherwise
to us when we are calm and cool.  ‘tis passion that then commands, ‘tis
passion that speaks, and not we.  faults [[fault]] seen through passion appear much
greater to us than they really are, as bodies [[body]] do when seen through a
mist.  he who is hungry uses meat; but he who will make use of
chastisement should have neither [[hunger]] nor thirst to it.  and, moreover,
chastisements that are inflicted with weight and discretion are much
better received and with greater benefit by him who suffers; otherwise,
he will not [[think]] himself justly condemned by a [[man]] transported with
anger and fury, and will allege his master’s excessive passion, his
inflamed countenance, his unwonted oaths, his emotion and precipitous
rashness, for his own justification:

              “ora tument ira, nigrescunt sanguine venae,
               lumina gorgoneo saevius igne micant.”

     [“their faces swell, their veins grow black with rage, and their
     [[eyes]] sparkle with gorgonian [[fire]].”--ovid, de art [[arts]]. amandi, iii. 503.]

suetonius reports that caius rabirius having been condemned by caesar,
the thing that most prevailed upon the [[people]] (to whom he had appealed)
to determine the cause in his favour, was the animosity and vehemence
that caesar had manifested in that sentence.

saying is a different thing from doing; we are to consider the sermon
apart and the preacher apart.  these [[men]] lent themselves to a pretty
business who in our times [[time]] have attempted to shake the [[truth]] of our church
by the vices [[vice]] of her ministers; she extracts her testimony elsewhere; ‘tis
a foolish way of arguing and that would throw all things into confusion.
a [[man]] whose morals [[moral]] are [[good]] may have false opinions [[opinion]], and a wicked [[man]] may
preach [[truth]], even though he [[believe]] it not himself.  ‘tis doubtless a
fine harmony when doing and saying go together; and i will not deny but
that saying, when the actions [[follow]], is not of greater [[authority]] and
efficacy, as eudamidas said, hearing a philosopher talk of military
affairs: “these things are finely said, but he who speaks them is not to
be believed for his ears have never been used to the sound of the
trumpet.”  and cleomenes, hearing an orator declaiming upon valour, burst
out into laughter, at which the other being angry; “i should,” said he to
him, “do the same if it were a swallow that spoke of this [[subject]]; but if
it were an eagle i should willingly hear him.”  i perceive, methinks, in
the writings of the ancients, that he who speaks what he thinks [[think]], strikes
much more [[home]] than he who only feigns.  hear cicero speak of the [[love]] of
liberty: hear brutus speak of it, the mere written words of this man
sound as if he would purchase it at the price of his [[life]].  let cicero,
the [[father]] of eloquence, treat of the contempt of [[death]]; let seneca do
the same: the first languishingly drawls it out so you perceive he would
make you resolve upon a thing on which he is not resolved himself; he
inspires you not with [[courage]], for he himself has none; the other
animates and inflames you.  i never [[read]] an author, even of those who
treat of [[virtue]] and of actions, that i do not curiously inquire what kind
of a [[man]] he was himself; for the ephori at sparta, seeing a dissolute
fellow propose a wholesome [[advice]] to the [[people]], commanded him to hold
his [[peace]], and entreated a [[virtuous]] [[man]] to attribute to himself the
invention, and to propose it.  plutarch’s writings, if well understood,
sufficiently bespeak their author, and so that i [[think]] i [[know]] him even
into his [[soul]]; and yet i could [[wish]] that we had some fuller account of
his [[life]].  and i am thus far wandered from my [[subject]], upon the account
of the obligation i have to aulus gellius, for having left us in writing
this story of his manners, that brings me back to my [[subject]] of anger.
a [[slave]] of his, a vicious, ill-conditioned fellow, but who had the
precepts of [[philosophy]] often ringing in his ears, having for some offence
of his been stript by plutarch’s command, whilst he was being whipped,
muttered at first, that it was without cause and that he had done nothing
to deserve it; but at [[last]] falling in [[good]] earnest to exclaim against and
rail at his master, he reproached him that he was no philosopher, as he
had boasted himself to be: that he had often heard him say it was
indecent to be angry, nay, had written a [[book]] to that [[purpose]]; and that
the causing him to be so cruelly beaten, in the height of his rage,
totally gave the [[lie]] to all his writings; to which plutarch calmly and
coldly answered, “how, ruffian,” said he, “by what dost thou [[judge]] that
i am now angry?  does either my face, my colour, or my voice give any
manifestation of my being moved?  i do not [[think]] my [[eyes]] look fierce,
that my countenance appears troubled, or that my voice is dreadful: am i
red, do i foam, does any word escape my lips i ought to repent?  do i
start?  do i tremble with fury?  for those, i tell thee, are the true
signs of anger.”  and so, turning to the fellow that was whipping him,
“ply on thy [[work]],” said he, “whilst this gentleman and i dispute.”  this
is his story.

archytas tarentinus, returning from a [[war]] wherein he had been
captain-general, found all things in his house in very [[great]] disorder,
and his lands [[land]] quite out of tillage, through the ill husbandry of his
receiver, and having caused him to be called to him; “go,” said he, “if i
were not in anger i would soundly drub your sides.”  [[plato]] likewise,
being highly offended with one of his slaves [[slave]], gave speusippus order to
chastise him, excusing himself from doing it because he was in anger.
and carillus, a lacedaemonian, to a helot, who carried himself insolently
towards him: “by the gods,” said he, “if i was not angry, i would
immediately cause thee to be put to [[death]].”

‘tis a passion that is pleased with and flatters itself.  how often,
being moved under a false cause, if the [[person]] offending makes a good
defence and presents [[present]] us with a just excuse, are we angry against truth
and innocence itself?  in proof of which, i [[remember]] a marvellous example
of antiquity.

piso, otherwise a [[man]] of very eminent [[virtue]], being moved against a
soldier of his, for that returning alone from forage he could give him no
account where he had left a companion of his, took it for granted that he
had killed him, and presently condemned him to [[death]].  he was no sooner
mounted upon the gibbet, but, behold, his wandering companion arrives, at
which all the [[army]] were exceedingly glad, and after many embraces of the
two comrades, the hangman carried both the one and the other into piso’s
presence, all those [[present]] believing it would be a [[great]] [[pleasure]] even
to himself; but it proved quite contrary; for through shame and spite,
his fury, which was not yet cool, redoubled; and by a subtlety which his
passion suddenly suggested to him, he made three criminals [[criminal]] for having
found one [[innocent]], and caused them all to be despatched: the first
soldier, because sentence had passed upon him; the second, who had lost
his way, because he was the cause of his companion’s [[death]]; and the
hangman, for not having obeyed the order which had been given him.
such as have had to do with testy and obstinate [[women]], may have
experimented into what a rage it puts them to oppose [[silence]] and coldness
to their fury, and that a [[man]] disdains to nourish their anger.  the
orator celius was wonderfully choleric by [[nature]]; and to one who supped
in his company, a [[man]] of a gentle and sweet conversation, and who, that
he might not move him, approved and consented to all he said; he,
impatient that his ill-humour should thus spend itself without aliment:
“for the [[love]] of the gods deny me something,” said he, “that we may be
two.”  [[women]], in like manner, are only angry that others may be angry
again, in imitation of the laws [[law]] of [[love]].  phocion, to one who interrupted
his speaking by injurious and very opprobrious words, made no other
return than [[silence]], and to give him full [[liberty]] and leisure to vent his
spleen; which he having accordingly done, and the storm blown over,
without any mention of this disturbance, he proceeded in his discourse
where he had left off before.  no [[answer]] can nettle a [[man]] like such a
contempt.

of the most choleric [[man]] in [[france]] (anger is always an imperfection, but
more excusable in, a soldier, for in that [[trade]] it cannot sometimes be
avoided) i often say, that he is the most patient [[man]] that i [[know]], and
the most discreet in bridling his [[passions]]; which rise in him with so
great [[violence]] and fury,

                    “magno veluti cum flamma sonore
          virgea suggeritur costis undantis ahem,
          exsultantque aatu latices, furit intus aquae vis.
          fumidus atque alte spumis exuberat amnis,
          nec jam se capit unda; volat vapor ater ad auras;”

     [“when with loud crackling noise, a [[fire]] of sticks is applied to the
     boiling caldron’s side, by the heat in frisky bells the liquor
     dances; within the water rages, and high the smoky fluid in foam
     overflows.  nor can the wave now contain itself; the black steam
     flies all abroad.”--aeneid, vii. 462.]


that he must of necessity cruelly constrain himself to moderate it.  and
for my part, i [[know]] no passion which i could with so much [[violence]] to
myself attempt to cover and conceal; i would not set [[wisdom]] at so high a
price; and do not so much consider what a [[man]] does, as how much it costs
him to do no worse.

another boasted himself to me of the regularity and gentleness of his
manners, which are to [[truth]] very singular; to whom i replied, that it was
indeed something, especially m persons [[person]] of so eminent a quality as
himself, upon whom every one had their [[eyes]], to [[present]] himself always
well-tempered to the [[world]]; but that the principal thing was to make
provision for within and for himself; and that it was not in my opinion
very well to order his [[business]] outwardly well, and to grate himself
within, which i was afraid he did, in putting on and maintaining this
mask and external appearance.

a [[man]] incorporates anger by concealing it, as diogenes told demosthenes,
who, for [[fear]] of being seen in a tavern, withdrew himself the more
retiredly into it: “the more you retire backward, the farther you enter
in.”  i would rather advise that a [[man]] should give his servant a box of
the ear a little unseasonably, than rack his fancy to [[present]] this grave
and composed countenance; and had rather discover my [[passions]] than brood
over them at my own expense; they grow less inventing and manifesting
themselves; and ‘tis much [[better]] their point should wound others without,
than be turned towards ourselves within:

     “omnia vitia in aperto leviora sunt: et tunc perniciosissima,
     quum simulata sanitate subsident.”

     [“all vices [[vice]] are less dangerous when open to be seen, and then most
     pernicious when they lurk under a dissembled [[good]] [[nature]].”
      --seneca, ep. 56]

i admonish all those who have [[authority]] to be angry in my [[family]], in the
first place to manage their anger and not to lavish it upon every
occasion, for that both lessens the value and hinders the effect: rash
and incessant scolding runs into custom, and renders itself despised; and
what you lay out upon a servant for a theft is not [[felt]], because it is
the same he has seen you a hundred times [[time]] employ against him for having
ill washed a glass, or set a stool out of place.  secondly, that they be
not angry to no [[purpose]], but make sure that their reprehension reach him
with whom they are offended; for, ordinarily, they rail and bawl before
he comes into their presence, and continue scolding an [[age]] after he is
gone:

               “et secum petulans amentia certat:”

          [“and petulant madness contends with itself.”
           --claudian in eutrop., i. 237.]

they attack his shadow, and drive the storm in a place where no one is
either chastised or concerned, but in the clamour of their voice.
i likewise in quarrels condemn those who huff and vapour without an
enemy: those rhodomontades should be reserved to discharge upon the
offending party:

         “mugitus veluti cum prima in praelia taurus
          terrificos ciet, atque irasci in cornua tentat,
          arboris obnixus trunco, ventospue lacessit
          ictibus, et sparsa ad pugnum proludit arena.”

     [“as when a bull to usher in the [[fight]], makes dreadful bellowings,
     and whets his horns against the trunk of a tree; with blows he beats
     the air, and rehearses the [[fight]] by scattering the sand.”
      --aeneid, xii. 103.]

when i am angry, my anger is very sharp but withal very short, and as
private as i can; i lose myself indeed in promptness and [[violence]], but
not in trouble; so that i throw out all sorts of injurious words at
random, and without [[choice]], and never consider pertinently to dart my
language where i [[think]] it will deepest wound, for i commonly make use of
no other weapon than my tongue.

my servants have a [[better]] bargain of me in [[great]] occasions [[occasion]] than in
little; the little ones surprise me; and the misfortune is, that when you
are once upon the precipice, ‘tis no matter who gave you the push, you
always go to the bottom; the fall urges, moves, and makes haste of
itself.  in [[great]] occasions [[occasion]] this satisfies me, that they are so just
every one expects a reasonable indignation, and then i glorify myself in
deceiving their expectation; against these, i fortify and prepare myself;
they disturb my head, and threaten to transport me very far, should i
follow them.  i can easily contain myself from entering into one of these
passions, and am [[strong]] enough, when i expect them, to repel their
violence, be the cause never so [[great]]; but if a passion once prepossess
and seize me, it carries me away, be the cause never so small.  i bargain
thus with those who may contend with me when you see me moved first, let
me alone, [[right]] or [[wrong]]; i’ll do the same for you.  the storm is only
begot by a concurrence of angers, which easily spring from one another,
and are not born together.  let every one have his own way, and we shall
be always at [[peace]].  a profitable [[advice]], but hard to execute.  sometimes
also it falls out that i put on a seeming anger, for the [[better]] governing
of my house, without any real emotion.  as [[age]] renders my humours [[humour]] more
sharp, i study to oppose them, and will, if i can, order it so, that for
the future i may be so much the less peevish and hard to please, as i
have more excuse and inclination to be so, although i have heretofore
been reckoned amongst those who have the [[greatest]] patience.

a word more to conclude this argument.  [[aristotle]] says, that anger
sometimes serves for arms to [[virtue]] and valour.  that is probable;
nevertheless, they who contradict him  pleasantly [[answer]], that ‘tis a
weapon of novel use, for we move all other arms, this moves us; our hand
guides it not, ‘tis it that guides our hand; it holds us, we hold not it.

defence of seneca and plutarch

the familiarity i have with these two authors, and the assistance they
have lent to my [[age]] and to my [[book]], wholly compiled of what i have
borrowed from them, oblige me to stand up for their [[honour]].

as to seneca, amongst a million of little pamphlets that those of the
so-called reformed [[religion]] disperse abroad for the defence of their cause
(and which sometimes proceed from so [[good]] a hand, that ‘tis [[pity]] his pen
is not employed in a [[better]] subject), i have formerly seen one, that to
make up the parallel he would fain find out betwixt the [[government]] of our
late [[poor]] [[king]] charles ix. and that of nero, compares the late cardinal
of lorraine with seneca; their fortunes [[fortune]], in having both of them been the
prime ministers in the [[government]] of their princes [[prince]], and in their manners,
conditions, and deportments to have been very near alike.  wherein, in my
opinion, he does the said cardinal a very [[great]] [[honour]]; for though i am
one of those who have a very high esteem for his wit, eloquence, and zeal
to [[religion]] and the service of his [[king]], and his [[good]] [[fortune]] to have
lived in an [[age]] wherein it was so novel, so rare, and also so necessary
for the [[public]] [[good]] to have an ecclesiastical [[person]] of such high birth
and [[dignity]], and so sufficient and capable of his place; yet, to confess
the [[truth]], i do not [[think]] his capacity by many degrees [[degree]] near to the other,
nor his [[virtue]] either so clean, entire, or steady as that of seneca.

now the [[book]] whereof i speak, to bring about its design, gives a very
injurious description of seneca, having borrowed its approaches from dion
the historian, whose testimony i do not at all [[believe]] for besides that
he is inconsistent, that after having called seneca one while very [[wise]],
and again a mortal [[enemy]] to nero’s vices [[vice]], makes him elsewhere avaricious,
an usurer, ambitious, effeminate, voluptuous, and a false pretender to
philosophy, his [[virtue]] appears so vivid and vigorous in his writings, and
his vindication is so clear from any of these imputations, as of his
riches and extraordinarily expensive way of living, that i cannot believe
any testimony to the contrary.  and besides, it is much more reasonable
to [[believe]] the roman historians in such things than greeks [[greek]] and
foreigners.  now tacitus and the rest speak very honourably both of his
life and [[death]]; and represent him to us a very excellent and virtuous
person in all things; and i will allege no other reproach against dion’s
report but this, which i cannot avoid, namely, that he has so [[weak]] a
judgment in the roman affairs, that he dares to maintain julius caesar’s
cause against pompey [and so does this editor.  d.w.], and that of antony
against cicero.

let us now come to plutarch: jean bodin is a [[good]] author of our times [[time]],
and a writer of much greater [[judgment]] than the rout of scribblers of his
age, and who deserves to be [[read]] and considered.  i find him, though, a
little bold in this passage of his method of [[history]], where he accuses
plutarch not only of ignorance (wherein i would have let him alone: for
that is beyond my criticism), but that he “often writes things
incredible, and absolutely fabulous “: these are his own words.  if he
had simply said, that he had delivered things otherwise than they really
are, it had been no [[great]] reproach; for what we have not seen, we are
forced to receive from other hands, and take upon trust, and i see that
he purposely sometimes variously relates the same story; as the judgment
of the three [[best]] captains that ever were, given by hannibal; ‘tis one
way in the [[life]] of flammius, and another in that of pyrrhus.  but to
charge him with having taken incredible and impossible things for current
pay, is to accuse the most judicious author in the [[world]] of want of
judgment.  and this is his [[example]]; “as,” says he, “when he relates that
a lacedaemonian boy [[suffered]] his bowels to be torn out by a fox-cub he
had stolen, and kept it still concealed under his coat till he fell down
dead, rather than he would discover his theft.”  i find, in the first
place, this [[example]] ill chosen, forasmuch as it is very hard to limit the
power of the faculties of--the [[soul]], whereas we have [[better]] [[authority]] to
limit and [[know]] the [[force]] of the bodily limbs; and therefore, if i had
been he, i should rather have chosen an [[example]] of this second sort; and
there are some of these less credible: and amongst others, that which he
refates of pyrrhus, that “all wounded as he was, he struck one of his
enemies, who was armed from head to foot, so [[great]] a blow with his [[sword]],
that he clave him down from his [[crown]] to his seat, so that the [[body]] was
divided into two parts.”  in this [[example]] i find no [[great]] miracle, nor do
i admit the excuse with which he defends plutarch, in having added these
words, “as ‘tis said,” to suspend our [[belief]]; for unless it be in things
received by [[authority]], and the reverence to antiquity or [[religion]], he
would never have himself admitted, or enjoined us to [[believe]] things
incredible in themselves; and that these words, “as ‘tis said,” are not
put in this place to that effect, is easy to be seen, because he
elsewhere relates to us, upon this [[subject]], of the patience of the
lacedaemonian [[children]], examples [[example]] happening in his [[time]], more unlikely to
prevail upon our [[faith]]; as what cicero has also testified before him, as
having, as he says, been upon the spot: that even to their times [[time]] there
were [[children]] found who, in the [[trial]] of patience they were put to before
the altar of diana, [[suffered]] themselves to be there whipped till the
blood ran down all over their bodies [[body]], not only without crying out, but
without so much as a groan, and some till they there voluntarily lost
their lives [[life]]: and that which plutarch also, amongst a hundred other
witnesses, relates, that at a [[sacrifice]], a burning coal having fallen
into the sleeve of a lacedaemonian boy, as he was censing, he suffered
his whole arm to be burned, till the smell of the broiling flesh was
perceived by those [[present]].  there was nothing, according to their
custom, wherein their [[reputation]] was more concerned, nor for which they
were to undergo more blame and disgrace, than in being taken in theft.
i am so fully satisfied of the greatness of those [[people]], that this story
does not only not appear to me, as to bodin, incredible; but i do not
find it so much as rare and [[strange]].  the spartan [[history]] is full of a
thousand more cruel and rare examples [[example]]; and is; indeed, all miracle in
this [[respect]].

marcellinus, concerning theft, reports that in his [[time]] there was no sort
of torments which could compel the [[egyptians]], when taken in this act,
though a [[people]] very much addicted to it, so much as to tell their name.

a spanish peasant, being put to the rack as to the accomplices of the
murder of the praetor lucius piso, cried out in the height of the
torment, “that his [[friends]] should not leave him, but look on in all
assurance, and that no [[pain]] had the [[power]] to [[force]] from him one word of
confession,” which was all they could get the first day.  the next day,
as they were leading him a second [[time]] to another [[trial]], strongly
disengaging himself from the hands of his guards, he furiously ran his
head against a wall, and beat out his brains.

epicharis, having tired and glutted the [[cruelty]] of nero’s satellites, and
undergone their [[fire]], their beating, their racks, a whole day together,
without one syllable of [[confession]] of her conspiracy; being the next day
brought again to the rack, with her limbs almost torn to pieces, conveyed
the lace of her robe with a running noose over one of the arms of her
chair, and suddenly slipping her head into it, with the weight of her own
body [[hanged]] herself.  having the [[courage]] to [[die]] in that manner, is it not
to be presumed that she purposely lent her [[life]] to the [[trial]] of her
fortitude the day before, to mock the [[tyrant]], and encourage others to the
like attempt?

and whoever will inquire of our troopers the experiences they have had in
our civil wars [[war]], will find effects of patience and obstinate resolution in
this miserable [[age]] of ours, and amongst this rabble even more effeminate
than the [[egyptians]], worthy to be compared with those we have just related
of the spartan [[virtue]].

i [[know]] there have been simple peasants amongst us who have endured the
soles of their feet to be broiled upon a gridiron, their finger-ends to
be crushed with the cock of a pistol, and their bloody [[eyes]] squeezed out
of their heads by [[force]] of a cord twisted about their brows, before they
would so much as [[consent]] to a ransom.  i have seen one left stark naked
for [[dead]] in a ditch, his neck black and swollen, with a halter yet about
it with which they had dragged him all night at a horse’s tail, his body
wounded in a hundred places, with stabs of daggers that had been given
him, not to kill him, but to put him to [[pain]] and to affright him, who had
endured all this, and even to being speechless and insensible, resolved,
as he himself told me, rather to [[die]] a thousand deaths [[death]] (as indeed, as to
matter of suffering, he had borne one) before he would promise anything;
and yet he was one of the richest husbandmen of all the [[country]].  how
many have been seen patiently to suffer themselves to be burnt and
roasted for opinions [[opinion]] taken upon trust from others, and by them not at all
understood?  i have known a hundred and a hundred [[women]] (for gascony has
a [[certain]] prerogative for obstinacy) whom you might sooner have made eat
fire than forsake an [[opinion]] they had conceived in anger.  they are all
the more exasperated by blows and constraint.  and he that made the story
of the woman who, in defiance of all correction, threats, and
bastinadoes, ceased not to call her husband lousy knave, and who being
plunged over head and ears in water, yet lifted her hands above her head
and made a sign of cracking lice, feigned a tale of which, in [[truth]], we
every day see a manifest image in the obstinacy of [[women]].  and obstinacy
is the sister of constancy, at least in vigour and stability.

we are not to [[judge]] what is possible and what is not, according to what
is credible and incredible to our apprehension, as i have said elsewhere
and it is a [[great]] [[fault]], and yet one that most [[men]] are guilty of, which,
nevertheless, i do not mention with any reflection upon bodin, to make a
difficulty of believing that in another which they could not or would not
do themselves.  every one thinks [[think]] that the [[sovereign]] stamp of [[human]] nature
is imprinted in him, and that from it all others must take their [[rule]];
and that all proceedings which are not like his are feigned and false.
is anything of another’s actions or faculties proposed to him? the first
thing he calls to the consultation of his [[judgment]] is his own [[example]];
and as matters go with him, so they must of necessity do with all the
world besides dangerous and intolerable folly!  for my part, i consider
some [[men]] as infinitely beyond me, especially amongst the ancients, and
yet, though i clearly discern my inability to come near them by a
thousand paces, i do not forbear to keep them in sight, and to [[judge]] of
what so elevates them, of which i perceive some seeds in myself, as i
also do of the extreme meanness of some other minds [[mind]], which i neither am
astonished at nor yet misbelieve.  i  very well perceive the turns those
great souls [[soul]] take to raise  themselves to such a pitch, and [[admire]] their
grandeur; and those flights that i [[think]] the bravest i could be glad to
imitate; where, though i want wing, yet my [[judgment]] readily goes along
with them.  the other [[example]] he introduces of “things incredible and
wholly fabulous,” delivered by plutarch, is, that “agesilaus was fined by
the ephori for having wholly engrossed the hearts [[heart]] and affections of his
citizens to himself alone.”  and herein i do not see what sign of falsity
is to be found: clearly plutarch speaks of things that must needs be
better known to him than to us; and it was no new thing in greece to see
men punished and exiled for this very thing, for being too acceptable to
the [[people]]; witness the ostracism and petalism.--[ostracism at athens
was [[banishment]] for ten years; petalism at syracuse was [[banishment]] for
five years.]

there is yet in this place another accusation laid against plutarch which
i cannot well digest, where bodin says that he has sincerely paralleled
romans with romans, and greeks [[greek]] amongst themselves, but not romans with
greeks; witness, says he, demosthenes and cicero, cato and aristides,
sylla and lysander, marcellus and pelopidas, pompey and agesilaus,
holding that he has favoured the greeks [[greek]] in giving them so unequal
companions.  this is really to attack what in plutarch is most excellent
and most to be commended; for in his parallels (which is the most
admirable part of all his works [[work]], and with which, in my [[opinion]], he is
himself the most pleased) the fidelity and sincerity of his judgments
equal their depth and weight; he is a philosopher who teaches [[teach]] us [[virtue]].
let us see whether we cannot defend him from this reproach of falsity and
prevarication.  all that i can imagine could give [[occasion]] to this
censure is the [[great]] and shining lustre of the roman names which we have
in our minds [[mind]]; it does not seem likely to us that demosthenes could rival
the [[glory]] of a consul, proconsul, and proctor of that [[great]] [[republic]]; but
if a [[man]] consider the [[truth]] of the thing, and the [[men]] in themselves,
which is plutarch’s chiefest aim, and will rather balance their manners,
their natures [[nature]], and parts, than their fortunes [[fortune]], i [[think]], contrary to
bodin, that cicero and the elder cato come far short of the [[men]] with whom
they are compared.  i should sooner, for his [[purpose]], have chosen the
example of the younger cato compared with phocion, for in this couple
there would have been a more likely disparity, to the roman’s advantage.
as to marcellus, sylla, and pompey, i very well discern that their
exploits of [[war]] are greater and more full of pomp and [[glory]] than those of
the greeks [[greek]], whom plutarch compares with them; but the bravest and most
virtuous actions any more in [[war]] than elsewhere, are not always the most
renowned.  i often see the names of captains obscured by the splendour of
other names of less desert; witness labienus, ventidius, telesinus, and
several others.  and to take it by that, were i to [[complain]] on the behalf
of the greeks [[greek]], could i not say, that camillus was much less comparable to
themistocles, the gracchi to agis and cleomenes, and numa to lycurgus?
but ‘tis folly to [[judge]], at one view, of things that have so many
aspects.  when plutarch compares them, he does not, for all that, make
them [[equal]]; who could more learnedly and sincerely have marked their
distinctions?  does he parallel the victories [[victory]], feats of arms, the force
of the armies [[army]] conducted by pompey, and his triumphs, with those of
agesilaus?  “i do not [[believe]],” says he, “that xenophon himself, if he
were now living, though he were allowed to write whatever pleased him to
the advantage of agesilaus, would dare to bring them into comparison.”
 does he speak of paralleling lysander to sylla.  “there is,” says he,
“no comparison, either in the number of victories [[victory]] or in the hazard of
battles, for lysander only gained two naval battles [[battle]].”  this is not to
derogate from the romans; for having only simply named them with the
greeks, he can have done them no injury, what disparity soever there may
be betwixt them and plutarch does not entirely oppose them to one
another; there is no preference in general; he only compares the pieces
and circumstances one after another, and gives of every one a particular
and separate [[judgment]].  wherefore, if any one could convict him of
partiality, he ought to pick out some one of those particular judgments [[judgment]],
or say, in general, that he was mistaken in comparing such a [[greek]] to
such a roman, when there were others more fit and [[better]] resembling to
parallel him to.




chapter xxxiii

the story of spurina

philosophy thinks [[think]] she has not ill employed her talent when she has given
the sovereignty of the [[soul]] and the [[authority]] of restraining our
appetites to [[reason]].  amongst which, they who [[judge]] that there is none
more [[violent]] than those which spring from [[love]], have this [[opinion]] also,
that they seize both [[body]] and [[soul]], and possess the whole [[man]], so that
even health itself depends upon them, and medicine is sometimes
constrained to pimp for them; but one might, on the contrary, also say,
that the mixture of the [[body]] brings an abatement and weakening; for such
desires are [[subject]] to satiety, and capable of material remedies.

many, being determined to rid their [[soul]] from the continual alarms of
this appetite, have made use of incision and amputation of the rebelling
members; others have subdued their [[force]] and ardour by the frequent
application of cold things, as snow and vinegar.  the sackcloths of our
ancestors were for this [[purpose]], which is cloth woven of horse hair, of
which some of them made shirts, and others girdles, to torture and
correct their reins.  a [[prince]], not long ago, told me that in his youth
upon a solemn festival in the court of [[king]] francis i., where everybody
was finely dressed, he would needs put on his father’s hair shirt, which
was still kept in the house; but how [[great]] soever his devotion was, he
had not patience to wear it till night, and was sick a long [[time]] after;
adding withal, that he did not [[think]] there could be any youthful heat so
fierce that the use of this recipe would not mortify, and yet perhaps he
never essayed the most [[violent]]; for [[experience]] shows us, that such
emotions are often seen under rude and slovenly clothes, and that a hair
shirt does not always render those chaste who wear it.

xenocrates proceeded with greater rigour in this affair; for his
disciples, to make [[trial]] of his continency, having slipt lais, that
beautiful and famous courtesan, into his bed, quite naked, excepting the
arms of her [[beauty]] and her wanton allurements, her philters, finding
that, in despite of his [[reason]] and philosophical rules [[rule]], his unruly flesh
began to mutiny, he caused those members of his to be burned that he
found consenting to this rebellion.  whereas the [[passions]] which wholly
reside in the [[soul]], as [[ambition]], avarice, and the rest, find the reason
much more to do, because it cannot there be helped but by its own means;
neither are those appetites capable of satiety, but grow sharper and
increase by fruition.

the sole [[example]] of julius caesar may suffice to demonstrate to us the
disparity of these appetites; for never was [[man]] more addicted to amorous
delights than he: of which one testimony is the peculiar [[care]] he had of
his [[person]], to such a [[degree]], as to make use of the most lascivious means
to that end then in use, as to have all the hairs of his [[body]] twitched
off, and to wipe all over with perfumes with the extremest nicety.
and he was a beautiful [[person]] in himself, of a [[fair]] [[complexion]], tall,
and sprightly, full faced, with quick hazel [[eyes]], if we may believe
suetonius; for the statues of him that we see at [[rome]] do not in all
points [[answer]] this description.  besides his wives [[wife]], whom he four times
changed, without reckoning the amours of his boyhood with nicomedes, king
of bithynia, he had the maidenhead of the renowned cleopatra, queen of
egypt; witness the little caesario whom he had by her.  he also made love
to.  eunoe, queen of mauritania, and at [[rome]], to posthumia, the [[wife]] of
servius sulpitius; to lollia, the [[wife]] of gabinius to tertulla, the wife
of crassus, and even to mutia, [[wife]] to the [[great]] pompey: which was the
reason, the roman historians say, that she was repudiated by her husband,
which plutarch confesses to be more than he knew; and the curios, both
father and [[son]], afterwards reproached pompey, when he [[married]] caesar’s
daughter, that he had made himself son-in-law to a [[man]] who had made him
cuckold, and one whom he himself was wont to call aegisthus.  besides all
these, he entertained servilia, cato’s sister and [[mother]] to marcus
brutus, whence, every one believes [[belief]], proceeded the [[great]] affection he had
to brutus, by [[reason]] that he was born at a [[time]] when it was likely he
might be his [[son]].  so that i have [[reason]], methinks, to take him for a man
extremely given to this debauch, and of very amorous [[constitution]].  but
the other passion of [[ambition]], with which he was infinitely smitten,
arising in him to contend with the former, it was boon compelled to give
way.

and here calling to [[mind]] mohammed, who won constantinople, and finally
exterminated the grecian name, i do not [[know]] where these two were so
evenly balanced; equally an indefatigable lecher and soldier: but where
they both meet in his [[life]] and jostle one another, the quarrelling
passion always gets the [[better]] of the amorous one, and this though it was
out of its [[natural]] season never regained an absolute sovereignty over the
other till he had arrived at an extreme old [[age]] and unable to undergo the
fatigues of [[war]].

what is related for a contrary [[example]] of ladislaus, [[king]] of naples, is
very remarkable; that being a [[great]] captain, valiant and ambitious, he
proposed to himself for the principal end of his [[ambition]], the execution
of his [[pleasure]] and the enjoyment of some rare and excellent [[beauty]].  his
death sealed up all the rest: for having by a close and tedious siege
reduced the [[city]] of florence to so [[great]] distress that the inhabitants
were compelled to capitulate about [[surrender]], he was content to let them
alone, provided they would deliver up to him a beautiful maid he had
heard of in their [[city]]; they were forced to yield to it, and by a private
injury to avert the [[public]] ruin.  she was the [[daughter]] of a famous
physician of his [[time]], who, finding himself involved in so foul a
necessity, resolved upon a high attempt.  as every one was lending a hand
to trick up his [[daughter]] and to adorn her with ornaments and jewels to
render her more agreeable to this new lover, he also gave her a
handkerchief most richly wrought, and of an exquisite perfume, an
implement they never go without in those parts, which she was to make use
of at their first approaches.  this handkerchief, poisoned with his
greatest art [[arts]], coming to be rubbed between the chafed flesh and open
pores, both of the one and the other, so suddenly infused the poison,
that immediately converting their warm into a cold sweat they presently
died in one another’s arms.

but i return to caesar.  his pleasures [[pleasure]] never made him steal one minute of
an hour, nor go one step aside from occasions [[occasion]] that might any way conduce
to his advancement.  this passion was so [[sovereign]] in him over all the
rest, and with so absolute [[authority]] possessed his [[soul]], that it guided
him at [[pleasure]].  in [[truth]], this troubles me, when, as to everything
else, i consider the greatness of this [[man]], and the wonderful parts
wherewith he was endued; learned to that [[degree]] in all sorts of knowledge
that there is hardly any one [[science]] of which he has not written; so
great an orator that many have preferred his eloquence to that of cicero,
and he, i conceive, did not [[think]] himself inferior to him in that
particular, for his two anti-catos were written to counterbalance the
elocution that cicero had expended in his cato.  as to the rest, was ever
soul so vigilant, so active, and so patient of [[labour]] as his? and,
doubtless, it was embellished with many rare seeds of [[virtue]], lively,
natural, and not put on; he was singularly sober; so far from being
delicate in his diet, that oppius relates, how that having one day at
table set before him medicated instead of [[common]] [[oil]] in some sauce, he
ate heartily of it, that he might not put his entertainer out of
countenance.  another [[time]] he caused his baker to be whipped for serving
him with a finer than ordinary sort of bread.  cato himself was wont to
say of him, that he was the first sober [[man]] who ever made it his business
to ruin his [[country]].  and as to the same cato’s calling, him one day
drunkard, it fell out thus being both of them in the senate, at a time
when catiline’s conspiracy was in [[question]] of which was caesar was
suspected, one came and brought him a letter sealed up.  cato believing
that it was something the conspirators gave him notice of, required him
to deliver into his hand, which caesar  was constrained to do to avoid
further suspicion.  it was by [[chance]] a love-letter that servilia, cato’s
sister, had written to him, which cato having [[read]], he threw it back to
him saying, “there, drunkard.”  this, i say, was rather a word of disdain
and anger than an express reproach of this [[vice]], as we often rate those
who anger us with the first injurious words that come into our mouths,
though nothing due to those we are offended at; to which may be added
that the [[vice]] with which cato upbraided him is wonderfully near akin to
that wherein he had surprised caesar; for bacchus and [[venus]], according to
the proverb, very willingly agree; but to me [[venus]] is much more sprightly
accompanied by sobriety.  the examples [[example]] of his sweetness and clemency to
those by whom he had been offended are infinite; i mean, besides those he
gave during the [[time]] of the civil wars [[war]], which, as plainly enough appears
by his writings, he practised to cajole his enemies [[enemy]], and to make them
less afraid of his future dominion and [[victory]].  but i must also say,
that if these examples [[example]] are not sufficient proofs of his natural
sweetness, they, at least, manifest a marvellous confidence and grandeur
of [[courage]] in this [[person]].  he has often been known to dismiss whole
armies, after having overcome them, to his enemies [[enemy]], without ransom, or
deigning so much as to bind them by oath, if not to favour him, at least
no more to bear arms against him; he has three or four times [[time]] taken some
of pompey’s captains prisoners [[prisoner]], and as often set them at [[liberty]].  pompey
declared all those to be enemies [[enemy]] who did not [[follow]] him to the [[war]]; he
proclaimed all those to be his [[friends]] who sat still and did not actually
take arms against him.  to such captains of his as ran away from him to
go over to the other side, he sent, moreover, their arms, horses, and
equipage: the cities [[city]] he had taken by [[force]] he left at full [[liberty]] to
follow which side they pleased, imposing no other garrison upon them but
the memory of his gentleness and clemency.  he gave strict and express
charge, the day of his [[great]] [[battle]] of pharsalia, that, without the
utmost necessity, no one should lay a hand upon the [[citizens]] of [[rome]].
these, in my [[opinion]], were very hazardous proceedings, and ‘tis no wonder
if those in our civil [[war]], who, like him, [[fight]] against the ancient
estate of their [[country]], do not [[follow]] his [[example]]; they are
extraordinary means, and that only appertain to caesar’s [[fortune]], and to
his admirable foresight in the conduct of affairs.  when i consider the
incomparable grandeur of his [[soul]], i excuse [[victory]] that it could not
disengage itself from him, even in so [[unjust]] and so wicked a cause.

to return to his clemency: we have many striking examples [[example]] in the [[time]] of
his [[government]], when, all things being reduced to his [[power]], he had no
more written against him which he had as sharply answered: yet he did not
soon after forbear to use his interest to make him consul.  caius calvus,
who had composed several injurious epigrams against him, having employed
many of his [[friends]] to mediate a reconciliation with him, caesar
voluntarily persuaded himself to write first to him.  and our good
catullus, who had so rudely ruffled him under the name of mamurra, coming
to offer his excuses to him, he made the same day sit at his table.
having [[intelligence]] of some who spoke ill of him, he did no more, but
only by a [[public]] oration declare that he had notice of it.  he still less
feared his enemies [[enemy]] than he hated them; some conspiracies and cabals that
were made against his [[life]] being discovered to him, he satisfied himself
in publishing by proclamation that they were known to him, without
further prosecuting the conspirators.

as to the [[respect]] he had for his [[friends]]: caius oppius, being with him
upon a [[journey]], and finding himself ill, he left him the only lodging he
had for himself, and lay all night upon a hard ground in the open air.
as to what concerns his [[justice]], he put a beloved servant of his to death
for lying with a [[noble]] roman’s [[wife]], though there was no complaint made.
never had [[man]] more moderation in his [[victory]], nor more resolution in his
adverse [[fortune]].

but all these [[good]] inclinations were stifled and spoiled by his furious
ambition, by which he [[suffered]] himself to be so transported and misled
that one may easily maintain that this passion was the rudder of all his
actions; of a liberal [[man]], it made him a [[public]] thief to supply this
bounty and profusion, and made him utter this vile and [[unjust]] saying,
“that if the most wicked and profligate persons [[person]] in the [[world]] had been
faithful in serving him towards his advancement, he would cherish and
prefer them to the utmost of his [[power]], as much as the [[best]] of [[men]].”
 it intoxicated him with so excessive a vanity, as to dare to boast in the
presence of his fellow-citizens, that he had made the [[great]] commonwealth
of [[rome]] a name without form and without [[body]]; and to say that his answers
for the future should stand for laws [[law]]; and also to receive the [[body]] of the
senate coming to him, sitting; to suffer himself to be adored, and to
have [[divine]] honours [[honour]] paid to him in his own presence.  to conclude, this
sole [[vice]], in my [[opinion]], spoiled in him the most [[rich]] and beautiful
nature that ever was, and has rendered his name abominable to all good
men, in that he would erect his [[glory]] upon the ruins of his [[country]] and
the subversion of the [[greatest]] and most flourishing [[republic]] the world
shall ever see.

there might, on the contrary, many examples [[example]] be produced of [[great]] [[men]] whom
pleasures have made to neglect the conduct of their affairs, as mark
antony and others; but where [[love]] and [[ambition]] should be in equal
balance, and come to jostle with [[equal]] forces [[force]], i make no [[doubt]] but the
last would [[win]] the prize.

to return to my [[subject]]: ‘tis much to bridle our appetites by the
argument of [[reason]], or, by [[violence]], to contain our members within their
duty; but to lash ourselves for our neighbour’s interest, and not only to
divest ourselves of the charming passion that tickles us, of the pleasure
we [[feel]] in being agreeable to others, and courted and beloved of every
one, but also to conceive a [[hatred]] against the graces that [[produce]] that
effect, and to condemn our [[beauty]] because it inflames others; of this, i
confess, i have met with few examples [[example]].  but this is one.  spurina, a
young [[man]] of tuscany:

         “qualis gemma micat, fulvum quae dividit aurum,
          aut collo decus, aut cupiti: vel quale per artem
          inclusum buxo aut oricia terebintho
          lucet ebur,”

     [“as a gem shines enchased in yellow gold, or an ornament on the
     neck or head, or as ivory has lustre, set by art [[arts]] in boxwood or
     orician ebony.”--aeneid, x. 134.]

being endowed with a singular [[beauty]], and so excessive, that the chastest
eyes could not chastely behold its rays; not contenting himself with
leaving so much flame and fever as he everywhere kindled without relief,
entered into a furious spite against himself and those [[great]] endowments
nature had so liberally conferred upon him, as if a [[man]] were responsible
to himself for the faults [[fault]] of others, and purposely slashed and
disfigured, with many wounds and scars, the [[perfect]] symmetry and
proportion that [[nature]] had so curiously imprinted in his face.  to give
my [[free]] [[opinion]], i more [[admire]] than [[honour]] such actions: such excesses
are enemies [[enemy]] to my rules [[rule]].  the design was conscientious and [[good]], but
certainly a little defective in prudence.  what if his deformity served
afterwards to make others guilty of the [[sin]] of [[hatred]] or contempt; or of
envy at the [[glory]] of so rare a recommendation; or of calumny,
interpreting this [[humour]] a mad ambition!  is there any form from which
vice cannot, if it will, extract [[occasion]] to exercise itself, one way or
another?  it had been more just, and also more [[noble]], to have made of
these gifts of [[god]] a [[subject]] of exemplary regularity and [[virtue]].

they who retire themselves from the [[common]] offices, from that infinite
number of troublesome rules [[rule]] that fetter a [[man]] of exact honesty in civil
life, are in my [[opinion]] very discreet, what peculiar sharpness of
constraint soever they impose upon themselves in so doing.  ‘tis in some
sort a [[kind]] of dying to avoid the [[pain]] of living well.  they may have
another [[reward]]; but the [[reward]] of difficulty i fancy they can never have;
nor, in uneasiness, that there can be anything more or [[better]] done than
the keeping oneself upright amid the waves of the [[world]], truly and
exactly performing all parts of our [[duty]].  ‘tis, peradventure, more easy
to keep clear of the [[sex]] than to maintain one’s [[self]] aright in all points
in the [[society]] of a [[wife]]; and a [[man]] may with less trouble adapt himself
to entire abstinence than to the due dispensation of abundance.  use,
carried on according to [[reason]], has in it more of difficulty than
abstinence; moderation is a [[virtue]] that gives more [[work]] than suffering;
the well living of scipio has a thousand fashions, that of diogenes but
one; this as much excels the ordinary lives [[life]] in innocence as the most
accomplished excel them in utility and [[force]].




chapter xxxiv

observation on the means to carry on a [[war]] according to julius caesar

‘tis related of many [[great]] leaders that they have had [[certain]] books [[book]] in
particular esteem, as alexander the [[great]], [[homer]]; scipio africanus,
xenophon; marcus brutus, polybius; charles v., philip’de comines; and
‘tis said that, in our times [[time]], machiavelli is elsewhere still in repute;
but the late marshal strozzi, who had taken caesar for his [[man]], doubtless
made the [[best]] [[choice]], seeing that it indeed ought to be the breviary of
every soldier, as being the true and [[sovereign]] pattern of the military
art.  and, moreover, [[god]] knows [[know]] with that grace and [[beauty]] he has
embellished that [[rich]] matter, with so pure, delicate, and perfect
expression, that, in my [[opinion]], there are no writings in the world
comparable to his, as to that [[business]].

i will set down some rare and particular passages of his wars [[war]] that remain
in my memory.

his [[army]], being in some consternation upon the rumour that was spread of
the [[great]] forces [[force]] that [[king]] juba was leading against him, instead of
abating the apprehension which his soldiers had conceived at the news and
of lessening to them the forces [[force]] of the [[enemy]], having called them all
together to encourage and reassure them, he took a quite contrary way to
what we are used to do, for he told them that they need no more trouble
themselves with inquiring after the enemy’s forces [[force]], for that he was
certainly informed thereof, and then told them of a number much
surpassing both the [[truth]] and the report that was current in his [[army]];
following the [[advice]] of cyrus in xenophon, forasmuch as the deception is
not of so [[great]] importance to find an [[enemy]] weaker than we expected, than
to find him really very [[strong]], after having been made to [[believe]] that he
was [[weak]].

it was always his use to accustom his soldiers simply to obey, without
taking upon them to control, or so much as to speak of their captain’s
designs, which he never communicated to them but upon the point of
execution; and he took a delight, if they discovered anything of what he
intended, immediately to [[change]] his orders to [[deceive]] them; and to that
purpose, would often, when he had assigned his quarters in a place, pass
forward and lengthen his day’s march, especially if it was foul and rainy
weather.

the swiss, in the beginning of his wars [[war]] in gaul, having sent to him to
demand a [[free]] passage over the roman territories, though resolved to
hinder them by [[force]], he nevertheless spoke kindly to the messengers, and
took some respite to return an [[answer]], to make use of that [[time]] for the
calling his [[army]] together.  these silly [[people]] did not [[know]] how [[good]] a
husband he was of his [[time]]: for he often repeats that it is the [[best]] part
of a captain to [[know]] how to make use of occasions [[occasion]], and his diligence in
his exploits is, in [[truth]], unheard of and incredible.

if he was not very conscientious in taking advantage of an [[enemy]] under
colour of a treaty of agreement, he was as little so in this, that he
required no other [[virtue]] in a soldier but valour only, and seldom
punished any other faults [[fault]] but mutiny and disobedience.  he would often
after his victories [[victory]] turn them loose to all sorts of licence, dispensing
them for some [[time]] from the rules [[rule]] of [[military]] discipline, saying withal
that he had soldiers so well trained up that, powdered and perfumed, they
would run furiously to the [[fight]].  in [[truth]], he loved to have them richly
armed, and made them wear engraved, gilded, and damasked armour, to the
end that the [[care]] of saving it might engage them to a more obstinate
defence.  speaking to them, he called them by the name of
fellow-soldiers, which we yet use; which his successor, augustus,
reformed, supposing he had only done it upon necessity, and to cajole
those who merely followed him as volunteers:

                         “rheni mihi caesar in undis
          dux erat; hic socius; facinus quos inquinat, aequat:”

     [“in the waters of the rhine caesar was my general; here at [[rome]] he
     is my fellow.  crime levels those whom it polluted.”
      --lucan, v. 289.]

but that this carriage was too mean and low for the [[dignity]] of an emperor
and general of an [[army]], and therefore brought up the custom of calling
them soldiers only.

with this courtesy caesar mixed [[great]] severity to keep them in awe; the
ninth legion having mutinied near placentia, he ignominiously cashiered
them, though pompey was then yet on foot, and received them not again to
grace till after many supplications; he quieted them more by authority
and boldness than by gentle ways.

in that place where he speaks of his, passage over the rhine to germany,
he says that, thinking it unworthy of the [[honour]] of the roman [[people]] to
waft over his [[army]] in vessels, he built a bridge that they might pass
over dry-foot.  there it was that he built that wonderful bridge of which
he gives so particular a description; for he nowhere so willingly dwells
upon his actions as in representing to us the subtlety of his inventions
in such [[kind]] of handiwork.

i have also observed this, that he set a [[great]] value upon his
exhortations to the soldiers before the [[fight]]; for where he would show
that he was either surprised or reduced to a necessity of fighting, he
always brings in this, that he had not so much as leisure to harangue his
army.  before that [[great]] [[battle]] with those of tournay, “caesar,” says he,
“having given order for everything else, presently ran where fortune
carried him to encourage his [[people]], and meeting with the tenth legion,
had no more [[time]] to say anything to them but this, that they should
remember their wonted valour; not to be astonished, but bravely sustain
the enemy’s encounter; and seeing the [[enemy]] had already approached within
a dart’s cast, he gave the signal for [[battle]]; and going suddenly thence
elsewhere, to encourage others, he found that they were already engaged.”
 here is what he tells us in that place.  his tongue, indeed, did him
notable service upon several occasions [[occasion]], and his [[military]] eloquence was,
in his own [[time]], so highly reputed, that many of his [[army]] wrote down his
harangues as he spoke them, by which means there were volumes of them
collected that existed a long [[time]] after him.  he had so particular a
grace in speaking, that his intimates, and augustus amongst others,
hearing those orations [[read]], could distinguish even to the phrases and
words that were not his.

the first [[time]] that he went out of [[rome]] with any [[public]] command, he
arrived in eight days at the river rhone, having with him in his coach a
secretary or two before him who were continually writing, and him who
carried his [[sword]] behind him.  and certainly, though a [[man]] did nothing
but go on, he could hardly attain that promptitude with which, having
been everywhere victorious in gaul, he left it, and, following pompey to
brundusium, in eighteen days’ [[time]] he subdued all [[italy]]; returned from
brundusium to [[rome]]; from [[rome]] went into the very [[heart]] of [[spain]], where he
surmounted extreme difficulties in the [[war]] against afranius and petreius,
and in the long siege of marseilles; thence he returned into macedonia,
beat the roman [[army]] at pharsalia, passed thence in pursuit of pompey into
egypt, which he also subdued; from [[egypt]] he went into syria and the
territories of pontus, where he fought pharnaces; thence into [[africa]],
where he defeated scipio and juba; again returned through [[italy]], where he
defeated pompey’s sons [[son]]:

               “ocyor et coeli fiammis, et tigride foeta.”

          [“swifter than lightning, or the cub-bearing tigress.”
           --lucan, v. 405]

              “ac veluti montis saxum de, vertice praeceps
               cum ruit avulsum vento, seu turbidus imber
               proluit, aut annis solvit sublapsa vetustas,
               fertur in abruptum magno mons improbus actu,
               exultatque solo, silvas, armenta, virosque,
               involvens secum.”

     [“and as a stone torn from the mountain’s top by the wind or rain
     torrents, or loosened by [[age]], falls massive with mighty [[force]],
     bounds here and there, in its course sweeps from the [[earth]] with it
     woods, herds, and [[men]].”--aeneid, xii. 684.]

speaking of the siege of avaricum, he says, that it, was his custom to be
night and day with the pioneers.--[engineers.  d.w.]--in all enterprises
of consequence he always reconnoitred in [[person]], and never brought his
army into quarters till he had first viewed the place, and, if we may
believe suetonius, when he resolved to pass over into [[england]], he was the
first [[man]] that sounded the passage.

he was wont to say that he more valued a [[victory]] obtained by counsel than
by [[force]], and in the [[war]] against petreius and afranius, fortune
presenting him with an [[occasion]] of manifest advantage, he declined it,
saying, that he hoped, with a little more [[time]], but less hazard, to
overthrow his enemies [[enemy]].  he there also played a notable part in commanding
his whole [[army]] to pass the river by swimming, without any manner of
necessity:

                    “rapuitque ruens in praelia miles,
          quod fugiens timuisset, iter; mox uda receptis
          membra fovent armis, gelidosque a gurgite, cursu
          restituunt artus.”

     [“the soldier rushing through a way to [[fight]] which he would have
     been afraid to have taken in flight: then with their armour they
     cover wet limbs, and by running restore warmth to their numbed
     joints.”--lucan, iv.  151.]

i find him a little more temperate and considerate in his enterprises
than alexander, for this [[man]] seems to seek and run headlong upon dangers
like an impetuous torrent which attacks and rushes against everything it
meets, without [[choice]] or discretion;

                    “sic tauriformis volvitur aufidus;
                    qui regna dauni perfluit appuli,
                    dum saevit, horrendamque cultis
                    diluviem meditatur agris;”

     [“so the biforked aufidus, which flows through the realm of the
     apulian daunus, when raging, threatens a fearful deluge to the
     tilled ground.”--horat., od., iv. 14, 25.]

and, indeed, he was a general in the flower and first heat of his [[youth]],
whereas caesar took up the [[trade]] at a ripe and well advanced [[age]]; to
which may be added that alexander was of a more sanguine, hot, and
choleric [[constitution]], which he also inflamed with wine, from which
caesar was very abstinent.

but where necessary [[occasion]] required, never did any [[man]] venture his
person more than he: so much so, that for my part, methinks i [[read]] in
many of his exploits a determinate resolution to throw himself away to
avoid the shame of being overcome.  in his [[great]] [[battle]] with those of
tournay, he charged up to the head of the enemies [[enemy]] without his shield,
just as he was seeing the van of his own [[army]] beginning to give ground’;
which also several other times [[time]] befell him.  hearing that his [[people]] were
besieged, he passed through the enemy’s [[army]] in [[disguise]] to go and
encourage them with his presence.  having crossed over to dyrrachium with
very slender forces [[force]], and seeing the remainder of his [[army]] which he had
left to antony’s conduct slow in following him, he undertook alone to
repass the sea in a very [[great]] storms and privately stole away to fetch
the rest of his forces [[force]], the ports on the other side being seized by
pompey, and the whole sea being in his possession.  and as to what he
performed by [[force]] of hand, there are many exploits that in hazard exceed
all the rules [[rule]] of [[war]]; for with how small means did he undertake to subdue
the [[kingdom]] of [[egypt]], and afterwards to attack the forces [[force]] of scipio and
juba, ten times [[time]] greater than his own?  these [[people]] had, i [[know]] not what,
more than [[human]] confidence in their [[fortune]]; and he was wont to say that
men must embark, and not deliberate, upon high enterprises.  after the
battle of pharsalia, when he had sent his [[army]] away before him into [[asia]],
and was passing in one [[single]] vessel the strait of the hellespont, he met
lucius cassius at sea with ten tall men-of-war, when he had the courage
not only to stay his coming, but to sail up to him and summon him to
yield, which he did.

having undertaken that furious siege of alexia, where there were
fourscore thousand [[men]] in garrison, all gaul being in arms to raise the
siege and having set an [[army]] on foot of a hundred and nine thousand
horse, and of two hundred and forty thousand foot, what a boldness and
vehement confidence was it in him that he would not give over his
attempt, but resolved upon two so [[great]] difficulties--which nevertheless
he overcame; and, after having won that [[great]] [[battle]] against those
without, soon reduced those within to his [[mercy]].  the same happened to
lucullus at the siege of tigranocerta against [[king]] tigranes, but the
condition of the [[enemy]] was not the same, considering the effeminacy of
those with whom lucullus had to deal.  i will here set down two rare and
extraordinary events concerning this siege of alexia; one, that the gauls
having drawn their powers [[power]] together to encounter caesar, after they had
made a general muster of all their forces [[force]], resolved in their council of
war to dismiss a [[good]] part of this [[great]] multitude, that they might not
fall into confusion.  this [[example]] of fearing to be too many is new; but,
to take it [[right]], it stands to [[reason]] that the [[body]] of an [[army]] should be
of a moderate greatness, and regulated to [[certain]] bounds, both out of
respect to the difficulty of providing for them, and the difficulty of
governing and keeping them in order.  at least it is very easy to make it
appear by [[example]] that armies [[army]] monstrous in number have seldom done
anything to [[purpose]].  according to the saying of cyrus in xenophon,
“‘tis not the number of [[men]], but the number of [[good]] [[men]], that gives the
advantage”: the remainder serving rather to trouble than assist.  and
bajazet principally grounded his resolution of giving tamerlane [[battle]],
contrary to the [[opinion]] of all his captains, upon this, that his enemies
numberless number of [[men]] gave him assured hopes [[hope]] of confusion.
scanderbeg, a very [[good]] and expert [[judge]] in such matters, was wont to say
that ten or twelve thousand reliable fighting [[men]] were sufficient to a
good leader to secure his regulation in all sorts of [[military]] occasions [[occasion]].
the other thing i will here record, which seems to be contrary both to
the custom and rules [[rule]] of [[war]], is, that vercingetorix, who was made general
of all the parts of the revolted gaul, should go shut up himself in
alexia: for he who has the command of a whole [[country]] ought never to shut
himself up but in case of such [[last]] extremity that the only place he has
left is in concern, and that the only [[hope]] he has left is in the defence
of that [[city]]; otherwise he ought to keep himself always at [[liberty]], that
he may have the means to provide, in general, for all parts of his
government.

to return to caesar.  he grew, in [[time]], more slow and more considerate,
as his friend oppius witnesses: conceiving that he ought not lightly to
hazard the [[glory]] of so many victories [[victory]], which one blow of [[fortune]] might
deprive him of.  ‘tis what the italians say, when they would reproach the
rashness and foolhardiness of [[young]] [[people]], calling them bisognosi
d’onore, “necessitous of [[honour]],” and that being in so [[great]] a want and
dearth of [[reputation]], they have [[reason]] to seek it at what price soever,
which they ought not to do who have acquired enough already.  there may
reasonably be some moderation, some satiety, in this thirst and appetite
of [[glory]], as well as in other things: and there are enough [[people]] who
practise it.

he was far remote from the [[religious]] scruples of the ancient romans, who
would never prevail in their wars [[war]] but by dint of pure and simple valour;
and yet he was more conscientious than we should be in these days, and
did not approve all sorts of means to obtain a [[victory]].  in the war
against ariovistus, whilst he was parleying with him, there happened some
commotion between the horsemen, which was occasioned by the [[fault]] of
ariovistus’ [[light]] horse, wherein, though caesar saw he had a very great
advantage of the [[enemy]], he would make no use on’t, lest he should have
been reproached with a [[treacherous]] proceeding.

he was always wont to wear [[rich]] garments, and of a shining colour in
battle, that he might be the more remarkable and [[better]] observed.

he always carried a stricter and tighter hand over his soldiers when near
an [[enemy]].  when the ancient greeks [[greek]] would accuse any one of extreme
insufficiency, they would say, in [[common]] proverb, that he could neither
read nor swim; he was of the same [[opinion]], that swimming was of [[great]] use
in [[war]], and himself found it so; for when he had to use diligence, he
commonly swam over the rivers in his way; for he loved to march on foot,
as also did alexander the [[great]].  being in [[egypt]] forced, to save himself,
to go into a little boat, and so many [[people]] leaping in with him that it
was in danger of sinking, he chose rather to commit himself to the sea,
and swam to his fleet, which lay two hundred paces off, holding in his
left hand his tablets, and drawing his coatarmour in his teeth, that it
might not fall into the enemy’s hand, and at this [[time]] he was of a pretty
advanced [[age]].

never had any general so much credit with his soldiers: in the beginning
of the civil wars [[war]], his centurions offered him to find every one a
man-at-arms at his own charge, and the foot soldiers to serve him at
their own expense; those who were most at their ease, moreover,
undertaking to defray the more necessitous.  the late admiral chastillon

     [gaspard de coligny, assassinated  in the st. bartholomew
     massacre, 24th august 1572.]

showed us the like [[example]] in our civil wars [[war]]; for the french of his army
provided [[money]] out of their own purses to [[pay]] the foreigners that were
with him.  there are but rarely found examples [[example]] of so ardent and so ready
an affection amongst the soldiers of elder times [[time]], who kept themselves
strictly to their rules [[rule]] of [[war]]: passion has a more absolute command over
us than [[reason]]; and yet it happened in the [[war]] against hannibal, that by
the [[example]] of the [[people]] of [[rome]] in the [[city]], the soldiers and captains
refused their [[pay]] in the [[army]], and in marcellus’ camp those were branded
with the name of mercenaries who would receive any.  having got the worst
of it near dyrrachium, his soldiers came and offered themselves to be
chastised and punished, so that there was more need to comfort than
reprove them.  one [[single]] cohort of his withstood four of pompey’s
legions above four hours together, till they were almost all killed with
arrows, so that there were a hundred and thirty thousand shafts found in
the trenches.  a soldier called scaeva, who commanded at one of the
avenues, invincibly maintained his ground, having lost an eye, with one
shoulder and one thigh shot through, and his shield hit in two hundred
and thirty places. it happened that many of his soldiers being taken
prisoners, rather chose to [[die]] than promise to join the contrary side.
granius petronius was taken by scipio in [[africa]]: scipio having put the
rest to [[death]], sent him word that he gave him his [[life]], for he was a man
of quality and quaestor, to whom petronius sent [[answer]] back, that
caesar’s soldiers were wont to give others their [[life]], and not to receive
it; and immediately with his own hand killed himself.

of their fidelity there are infinite examples [[example]] amongst them, that which
was done by those who were besieged in salona, a [[city]] that stood for
caesar against pompey, is not, for the rarity of an accident that there
happened, to be forgotten.  marcus octavius kept them close besieged;
they within being reduced to the extremest necessity of all things, so
that to supply the want of [[men]], most of them being either slain or
wounded, they had manumitted all their slaves [[slave]], and had been constrained
to cut off all the women’s hair to make ropes for their [[war]] engines,
besides a wonderful dearth of victuals, and yet continuing resolute never
to yield.  after having drawn the siege to a [[great]] length, by which
octavius was grown more negligent and less attentive to his enterprise,
they made [[choice]] of one day about noon, and having first placed the women
and [[children]] upon the walls to make a show, sallied upon the besiegers
with such fury, that having routed the first, second, and third [[body]], and
afterwards the fourth, and the rest, and beaten them all out of their
trenches, they pursued them even to their ships, and octavius himself was
fain to fly to dyrrachium, where pompey lay.  i do not at present
remember that i have met with any other [[example]] where the besieged ever
gave the besieger a total defeat and won the field, nor that a sortie
ever achieved the result of a pure and entire [[victory]].




chapter xxxv

of three [[good]] women

they are not by the dozen, as every one knows [[know]], and especially in the
duties of [[marriage]], for that is a bargain full of so many nice
circumstances that ‘tis hard a woman’s will should long endure such a
restraint; [[men]], though their condition be something [[better]] under that
tie, have yet enough to do.  the true touch and test of a [[happy]] marriage
have [[respect]] to the [[time]] of the companionship, if it has been constantly
gentle, [[loyal]], and agreeable.  in our [[age]], [[women]] commonly reserve the
publication of their [[good]] offices, and their vehement affection towards
their husbands, until they have lost them, or at least, till then defer
the testimonies of their [[good]] will; a too slow testimony and
unseasonable. by it they rather manifest that they never loved them till
dead: their [[life]] is nothing but trouble; their [[death]] full of [[love]] and
courtesy.  as fathers [[father]] conceal their affection from their [[children]], [[women]],
likewise, conceal theirs from their husbands, to maintain a modest
respect.  this mystery is not for my palate; ‘tis to much [[purpose]] that
they scratch themselves and tear their hair.  i whisper in a
waiting-woman’s or secretary’s ear: “how were they, how did they live
together?” i always have that [[good]] saying m my head:

               “jactantius moerent, quae minus dolent.”

     [“they make the most ado who are least concerned.” (or:)
     “they mourn the more ostentatiously, the less they grieve.”
      --tacitus, annal., ii. 77, writing of germanicus.]

their whimpering is offensive to the living and [[vain]] to the [[dead]].  we
should willingly give them leave to laugh after we are [[dead]], provided
they will smile upon us whilst we are alive.  is it not enough to make a
man revive in pure spite, that she, who spat in my face whilst i was in
being, shall come to kiss my feet when i am no more?  if there be any
honour in lamenting a husband, it only appertains to those who smiled
upon them whilst they had them; let those who wept during their lives
laugh at their deaths [[death]], as well outwardly as within.  therefore, never
regard those blubbered [[eyes]] and that pitiful voice; consider her
deportment, her [[complexion]], the plumpness of her cheeks under all those
formal veils; ‘tis there she talks plain french.  there are few who do
not mend upon’t, and health is a quality that cannot [[lie]].  that starched
and ceremonious countenance looks not so much back as forward, and is
rather intended to get a new husband than to lament the old.  when i was
a boy, a very beautiful and [[virtuous]] [[lady]], who is yet living, the widow
of a [[prince]], wore somewhat more ornament in her dress than our laws [[law]] of
widowhood allow, and being reproached with it, she made [[answer]] that it
was because she was resolved to have no more [[love]] affairs, and would
never [[marry]] again.

i have here, not at all dissenting from our customs, made [[choice]] of three
women, who have also expressed the utmost of their goodness and affection
about their husbands’ deaths [[death]]; yet are they examples [[example]] of another [[kind]] than
are now m use, and so austere that they will hardly be drawn into
imitation.

the younger pliny’ had near a house of his in [[italy]] a neighbour who was
exceedingly tormented with [[certain]] ulcers in his private parts.  his wife
seeing him so long to languish, entreated that he would give her leave to
see and at leisure to consider of the condition of his disease, and that
she would freely tell him what she [[thought]].  this permission being
obtained, and she having curiously examined the [[business]], found it
impossible he could ever be cured, and that all he had to [[hope]] for or
expect was a [[great]] while to linger out a painful and miserable [[life]], and
therefore, as the most sure and [[sovereign]] remedy, resolutely advised him
to kill himself.  but finding him a little tender and backward in so rude
an attempt: “do not [[think]], my friend,” said she, “that the torments i see
thee endure are not as sensible to me as to thyself, and that to deliver
myself from them, i will not myself make use of the same remedy i have
prescribed to thee.  i will accompany thee in the cure as i have done in
the disease; [[fear]] nothing, but [[believe]] that we shall have [[pleasure]] in
this passage that is to [[free]] us from so many miseries, and we will go
happily together.”  which having said, and roused up her husband’s
courage, she resolved that they should throw themselves headlong into the
sea out of a window that overlooked it, and that she might maintain to
the [[last]] the [[loyal]] and vehement affection wherewith she had embraced him
during his [[life]], she would also have him [[die]] in her arms; but lest they
should fail, and should quit their hold in the fall through [[fear]], she
tied herself fast to him by the waist, and so gave up her own [[life]] to
procure her husband’s repose.  this was a woman of mean condition; and,
amongst that class of [[people]], ‘tis no very new thing to see some examples
of rare [[virtue]]:

                         “extrema per illos
               justitia excedens terris vestigia fecit.”

          [“justice, when she left the [[earth]], took her last
          steps among them.”--virgil, georg., ii.  473.]

the other two were [[noble]] and [[rich]], where examples [[example]] of [[virtue]] are rarely
lodged.

arria, the [[wife]] of caecina paetus, a consular [[person]], was the [[mother]] of
another arria, the [[wife]] of thrasea paetus, he whose [[virtue]] was so
renowned in the [[time]] of nero, and by this son-in-law, the grandmother of
fannia: for the resemblance of the names of these [[men]] and [[women]], and
their fortunes [[fortune]], have [[led]] to several mistakes.  this first arria, her
husband caecina paetus, having been taken [[prisoner]] by some of the emperor
claudius’ [[people]], after scribonianus’ defeat, whose party he had embraced
in the [[war]], begged of those who were to carry him [[prisoner]] to [[rome]], that
they would take her into their ship, where she would be of much less
charge and trouble to them than a [[great]] many persons [[person]] they must otherwise
have to attend her husband, and that she alone would undertake to serve
him in his chamber, his kitchen, and all other offices.  they refused,
whereupon she put herself into a fisher-boat she hired on the spot, and
in that manner followed him from sclavonia.  when she had come to [[rome]],
junia, the widow of scribonianus, having one day, from the resemblance of
their [[fortune]], accosted her in the emperor’s presence; she rudely
repulsed her with these words, “i,” said she, “speak to thee, or give ear
to any thing thou sayest! to thee in whose lap scribonianus was slain,
and thou art [[arts]] yet alive!”  these words, with several other signs, gave her
friends to [[understand]] that she would undoubtedly despatch herself,
impatient of supporting her husband’s misfortune.  and thrasea, her
son-in-law, beseeching her not to throw away herself, and saying to her,
“what! if i should run the same [[fortune]] that caecina has done, would you
that your [[daughter]], my [[wife]], should do the same?”--“would i?”  replied
she, “yes, yes, i would: if she had lived as long, and in as good
understanding with thee as i have done, with my husband.”  these answers
made them more careful of her, and to have a more watchful eye to her
proceedings.  one day, having said to those who looked to her: “tis to
much [[purpose]] that you take all this pains [[pain]] to prevent me; you may indeed
make me [[die]] an ill [[death]], but to keep me from dying is not in your
power”; she in a sudden phrenzy started from a chair whereon she sat, and
with all her [[force]] dashed her head against the wall, by which blow being
laid flat in a swoon, and very much wounded, after they had again with
great ado brought her to herself: “i told you,” said she, “that if you
refused me some easy way of dying, i should find out another, how painful
soever.”  the conclusion of so admirable a [[virtue]] was this: her husband
paetus, not having resolution enough of his own to despatch himself, as
he was by the emperor’s [[cruelty]] enjoined, one day, amongst others, after
having first employed all the reasons [[reason]] and exhortations which she thought
most prevalent to persuade him to it, she snatched the poignard he wore
from his side, and holding it ready in her hand, for the conclusion of
her admonitions; “do thus, paetus,” said she, and in the same instant
giving herself a mortal stab in the breast, and then drawing it out of
the wound, presented it to him, ending her [[life]] with this [[noble]],
generous, and [[immortal]] saying, “paete, non dolet”--having [[time]] to
pronounce no more but those three never-to-be-forgotten words: “paetus,
it is not painful.”

              “casta suo gladium cum traderet arria paeto,
               quern de visceribus traxerat ipsa suis
               si qua fides, vulnus quod feci non dolet, inquit,
               sed quod to facies, id mihi, paete, dolet.”

     [“when the chaste arria gave to poetus the reeking [[sword]] she had
     drawn from her breast, ‘if you [[believe]] me,’ she said, ‘paetus, the
     wound i have made hurts not, but ‘tis that which thou wilt make that
     hurts me.’”---martial, i. 14.]

the action was much more [[noble]] in itself, and of a braver sense than the
poet expressed it: for she was so far from being deterred by the thought
of her husband’s wound and [[death]] and her own, that she had been their
promotress and adviser: but having performed this high and courageous
enterprise for her husband’s only convenience, she had even in the last
gasp of her [[life]] no other concern but for him, and of dispossessing him
of the [[fear]] of dying with her.  paetus presently struck himself to the
heart with the same weapon, ashamed, i suppose, to have stood in need of
so dear and precious an [[example]].

pompeia paulina, a [[young]] and very [[noble]] roman [[lady]], had [[married]] seneca in
his extreme old [[age]].  nero, his fine pupil, sent his guards to him to
denounce the sentence of [[death]], which was performed after this manner:
when the roman emperors [[emperor]] of those times [[time]] had condemned any [[man]] of quality,
they sent to him by their officers to choose what [[death]] he would, and to
execute it within such or such a [[time]], which was limited, according to
the [[degree]] of their indignation, to a shorter or a longer respite, that
they might therein have [[better]] leisure to dispose their affairs, and
sometimes depriving them of the means of doing it by the shortness of the
time; and if the condemned seemed unwilling to submit to the order, they
had [[people]] ready at hand to execute it either by cutting the veins of the
arms and legs, or by compelling them by [[force]] to swallow a draught of
poison.  but persons [[person]] of [[honour]] would not abide this necessity, but made
use of their own physicians and surgeons for this [[purpose]].  seneca, with
a calm and steady countenance, heard their charge, and presently called
for paper to write his will, which being by the captain refused, he
turned himself towards his [[friends]], saying to them, “since i cannot leave
you any other acknowledgment of the obligation i have to you, i leave you
at least the [[best]] thing i have, namely, the image of my [[life]] and manners,
which i entreat you to keep in memory of me, that by so doing you may
acquire the [[glory]] of sincere and real [[friends]].”  and there withal, one
while appeasing the [[sorrow]] he saw in them with gentle words, and
presently raising his voice to reprove them: “what,” said he, “are become
of all our brave philosophical precepts? what are become of all the
provisions we have so many years laid up against the accidents of
fortune? is nero’s [[cruelty]] unknown to us?  what could we expect from him
who had murdered his [[mother]] and his [[brother]], but that he should put his
tutor to [[death]] who had brought him up?”  after having spoken these words
in general, he turned himself towards his [[wife]], and embracing her fast in
his arms, as, her [[heart]] and [[strength]] failing her, she was ready to sink
down with [[grief]], he begged of her, for his sake, to bear this accident
with a little more patience, telling her, that now the hour was come
wherein he was to show, not by argument and discourse, but effect, the
fruit he had acquired by his studies, and that he really embraced his
death, not only without [[grief]], but moreover with joy.  “wherefore, my
dearest,” said he, “do not dishonour it with thy tears, that it may not
seem as if thou lovest thyself more than my [[reputation]].  moderate thy
grief, and comfort thyself in the [[knowledge]] thou hast had of me and my
actions, leading the remainder of thy [[life]] in the same [[virtuous]] manner
thou hast hitherto done.”  to which paulina, having a little recovered
her spirits, and warmed the magnanimity of her [[courage]] with a most
generous affection, replied,--“no, seneca,” said she, “i am not a woman
to suffer you to go alone in such a necessity: i will not have you think
that the [[virtuous]] examples [[example]] of your [[life]] have not taught me how to [[die]];
and when can i ever [[better]] or more fittingly do it, or more to my own
desire, than with you? and therefore assure yourself i will go along with
you.”  then seneca, taking this [[noble]] and generous resolution of his wife
m [[good]] part, and also willing to [[free]] himself from the [[fear]] of leaving
her exposed to the [[cruelty]] of his enemies [[enemy]] after his [[death]]: “i have,
paulina,” said he, “instructed thee in what would serve thee happily to
live; but thou more covetest, i see, the [[honour]] of dying: in [[truth]],
i will not grudge it thee; the constancy and resolution in our [[common]] end
are the same, but the [[beauty]] and [[glory]] of thy part are much greater.”
 which being said, the surgeons, at the same [[time]], opened the veins of
both their arms, but as those of seneca were more shrunk up, as well with
age as abstinence, made his [[blood]] flow too slowly, he moreover commanded
them to open the veins of his thighs; and lest the torments he endured
might pierce his wife’s [[heart]], and also to [[free]] himself from the
affliction of seeing her in so [[sad]] a condition, after having taken a very
affectionate leave of her, he entreated she would suffer them to carry
her into her chamber, which they accordingly did.  but all these
incisions being not yet enough to make him [[die]], he commanded statius
anneus, his physician, to give him a draught of poison, which had not
much [[better]] effect; for by [[reason]] of the weakness and coldness of his
limbs, it could not arrive at his [[heart]].  wherefore they were forced to
superadd a very hot bath, and then, feeling his end approach, whilst he
had breath he continued excellent discourses upon the [[subject]] of his
present condition, which the secretaries wrote down so long as they could
hear his voice, and his [[last]] words were long after in high [[honour]] and
esteem amongst [[men]], and it is a [[great]] loss to us that they have not come
down to our times [[time]].  then, feeling the [[last]] pangs of [[death]], with the
bloody water of the bath he bathed his head, saying: “this water i
dedicate to [[jupiter]] the deliverer.”  nero, being presently informed of
all this, fearing lest the [[death]] of paulina, who was one of the best-born
ladies of [[rome]], and against whom he had no particular unkindness, should
turn to his reproach, sent orders in all haste to bind up her wounds,
which her attendants did without her [[knowledge]], she being already half
dead, and without all manner of sense.  thus, though she lived contrary
to her own design, it was very honourably, and befitting her own [[virtue]],
her pale [[complexion]] ever after manifesting how much [[life]] had run from her
veins.

these are my three very true stories, which i find as entertaining and as
tragic as any of those we make out of our own heads wherewith to amuse
the [[common]] [[people]]; and i wonder that they who are addicted to such
relations, do not rather cull out ten thousand very fine stories, which
are to be found in books [[book]], that would save them the trouble of invention,
and be more useful and diverting; and he who would make a whole and
connected [[body]] of them would need to add nothing of his own, but the
connection only, as it were the solder of another metal; and might by
this means embody a [[great]] many true events of all sorts, disposing and
diversifying them according as the [[beauty]] of the [[work]] should require,
after the same manner, almost, as ovid has made up his metamorphoses of
the infinite number of various fables.

in the [[last]] couple, this is, moreover, worthy of consideration, that
paulina voluntarily offered to lose her [[life]] for the [[love]] of her husband,
and that her husband had formerly also forborne to [[die]] for the [[love]] of
her.  we may [[think]] there is no just counterpoise in this exchange; but,
according to his stoical [[humour]], i fancy he [[thought]] he had done as much
for her, in prolonging his [[life]] upon her account, as if he had died for
her.  in one of his letters to lucilius, after he has given him to
understand that, being seized with an ague in [[rome]], he presently took
coach to go to a house he had in the [[country]], contrary to his wife’s
opinion, who would have him stay, and that he had told her that the ague
he was seized with was not a fever of the [[body]] but of the place, it
follows thus: “she let me go,” says he, “giving me a strict charge of my
health.  now i, who [[know]] that her [[life]] is involved in mine, begin to make
much of myself, that i may preserve her.  and i lose the [[privilege]] my age
has given me, of being more constant and resolute in many things, when i
call to [[mind]] that in this old fellow there is a [[young]] girl who is
interested in his health.  and since i cannot persuade her to [[love]] me
more courageously, she makes me more solicitously [[love]] myself: for we
must allow something to honest affections, and, sometimes, though
occasions importune us to the contrary, we must call back [[life]], even
though it be with torment: we must hold the [[soul]] fast in our teeth, since
the [[rule]] of living, amongst [[good]] [[men]], is not so long as they please, but
as long as they ought.  he that loves [[love]] not his [[wife]] nor his friend so well
as to prolong his [[life]] for them, but will obstinately [[die]], is too
delicate and too effeminate: the [[soul]] must impose this upon itself, when
the utility of our [[friends]] so requires; we must sometimes lend ourselves
to our [[friends]], and when we would [[die]] for ourselves must break that
resolution for them.  ‘tis a testimony of grandeur of [[courage]] to return
to [[life]] for the consideration of another, as many excellent persons [[person]] have
done: and ‘tis a mark of singular [[good]] [[nature]] to preserve old [[age]] (of
which the [[greatest]] convenience is the indifference as to its duration,
and a more stout and disdainful use of life), when a [[man]] perceives that
this office is pleasing, agreeable, and useful to some [[person]] by whom he
is very much beloved.  and a [[man]] reaps by it a very pleasing [[reward]]; for
what can be more delightful than to be so dear to his [[wife]], as upon her
account he shall become dearer to himself?  thus has my paulina loaded me
not only with her fears [[fear]], but my own; it has not been sufficient to
consider how resolutely i could [[die]], but i have also considered how
irresolutely she would bear my [[death]].  i am enforced to [[live]], and
sometimes to [[live]] in magnanimity.”  these are his own words, as excellent
as they everywhere are.




chapter xxxvi

of the most excellent men

if i should be [[asked]] my [[choice]] among all the [[men]] who have come to my
knowledge, i should make [[answer]], that methinks i find three more
excellent than all the rest.

one of them [[homer]]: not that [[aristotle]] and varro, for [[example]], were not,
peradventure, as learned as he; nor that possibly [[virgil]] was not [[equal]] to
him in his own art [[arts]], which i leave to be determined by such as [[know]] them
both.  i who, for my part, [[understand]] but one of them, can only say this,
according to my [[poor]] talent, that i do not [[believe]] the muses themselves
could ever go beyond the roman:

              “tale facit carmen docta testudine, quale
               cynthius impositis temperat articulis:”

     [“he plays on his learned lute a verse such as cynthian apollo
     modulates with his imposed fingers.”--propertius, ii. 34, 79.]

and yet in this [[judgment]] we are not to forget that it is chiefly from
homer that [[virgil]] derives his excellence, that he is guide and teacher;
and that one touch of the iliad has supplied him with [[body]] and matter out
of which to compose his [[great]] and [[divine]] aeneid.  i do not reckon upon
that, but mix several other circumstances that render to me this poet
admirable, even as it were above [[human]] condition.  and, in [[truth]], i often
wonder that he who has produced, and, by his [[authority]], given reputation
in the [[world]] to so many deities, was not deified himself.  being blind
and [[poor]], living before the sciences [[science]] were reduced into [[rule]] and certain
observation, he was so well acquainted with them, that all those who have
since taken upon them to establish governments [[government]], to carry on wars [[war]], and to
write either of [[religion]] or [[philosophy]], of what sect soever, or of the
arts, have made use of him as of a most [[perfect]] instructor in the
knowledge of all things, and of his books [[book]] as of a treasury of all sorts
of learning:

         “qui, quid sit pulcrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,
          planius ac melius chrysippo et crantore dicit:”

     [“who tells us what is [[good]], what [[evil]], what useful, what not, more
     clearly and [[better]] than chrysippus and crantor?”
      --horace, ep., i. 2, 3.]

and as this other says,

                   “a quo, ceu fonte perenni,
                    vatum pieriis ora rigantur aquis”

     [“from which, as from a perennial spring, the lips of the poets
     are moistened by pierian waters.”--ovid, amoy., iii. 9, 25.]

and the other,

              “adde heliconiadum comites, quorum unus homerus
               sceptra potitus;”

     [“add the companions of the muses, whose sceptre [[homer]] has solely
     obtained.”--lucretius, iii.  1050.]

and the other:

                         “cujusque ex ore profusos
               omnis posteritas latices in carmina duxit,
               amnemque in tenues ausa est deducere rivos.
               unius foecunda bonis.”

     [“from whose mouth all [[posterity]] has drawn out copious streams of
     verse, and has made bold to turn the mighty river into its little
     rivulets, fertile in the [[property]] of one [[man]].”
      --manilius, astyon., ii. 8.]

‘tis contrary to the order of [[nature]] that he has made the most excellent
production that can possibly be; for the ordinary birth of things is
imperfect; they thrive and gather [[strength]] by growing, whereas he
rendered the infancy of poesy and several other sciences [[science]] mature, [[perfect]],
and accomplished at first.  and for this [[reason]] he may be called the
first and the [[last]] of the poets, according to the fine testimony
antiquity has left us of him, “that as there was none before him whom he
could imitate, so there has been none since that could imitate him.”
 his words, according to [[aristotle]], are the only words that have motion
and action, the only substantial words.  alexander the [[great]], having
found a [[rich]] cabinet amongst darius’ spoils, gave order it should be
reserved for him to keep his [[homer]] in, saying: that he was the [[best]] and
most faithful counsellor he had in his [[military]] affairs.  for the same
reason it was that cleomenes, the [[son]] of anaxandridas, said that he was
the poet of the lacedaemonians, for that he was an excellent master for
the discipline of [[war]].  this singular and particular commendation is also
left of him in the [[judgment]] of plutarch, that he is the only author in
the [[world]] that never glutted nor disgusted his readers, presenting
himself always another thing, and always flourishing in some new grace.
that wanton alcibiades, having [[asked]] one, who pretended to learning, for
a [[book]] of [[homer]], gave him a box of the ear because he had none,  which he
thought as scandalous as we should if we found one of our priests [[priest]] without
a breviary.  xenophanes complained one day to hiero, the [[tyrant]] of
syracuse, that he was so [[poor]] he had not wherewithal to maintain two
servants.  “what!” replied he, “homer, who was much poorer than thou
art, keeps above ten thousand, though he is [[dead]].”  what did panaetius
leave unsaid when he called [[plato]] the [[homer]] of the [[philosophers]]?  besides
what [[glory]] can be compared to his?  nothing is so frequent in men’s
mouths as his name and works [[work]], nothing so known and received as troy,
helen, and the [[war]] about her, when perhaps there was never any such
thing.  our [[children]] are still called by names that he [[invented]] above
three thousand years ago; who does not [[know]] [[hector]] and achilles?  not
only some particular families [[family]], but most nations also seek their origin in
his inventions.  mohammed, the second of that name, [[emperor]] of the turks,
writing to our [[pope]] pius ii., “i am astonished,” says he, “that the
italians should appear against me, considering that we have our common
descent from the trojans, and that it concerns me as well as it does them
to [[revenge]] the [[blood]] of [[hector]] upon the greeks [[greek]], whom they countenance
against me.”  is it not a [[noble]] farce wherein kings [[king]], republics [[republic]], and
emperors have so many ages [[age]] played their parts, and to which the vast
universe serves for a theatre?  seven grecian cities [[city]] contended for his
birth, so much [[honour]] even his obscurity helped him to!

     “smyrna, rhodos, colophon, salamis, chios, argos, athenm.”

the other is alexander the [[great]].  for whoever will consider the [[age]] at
which he began his enterprises, the small means by which he effected so
glorious a design, the [[authority]] he obtained in such mere [[youth]] with the
greatest and most experienced captains of the [[world]], by whom he was
followed, the extraordinary favour wherewith [[fortune]] embraced and
favoured so many hazardous, not to say rash, exploits,

               “impellens quicquid sibi summa petenti
               obstaret, gaudensque viam fecisse ruins;”

     [“bearing down all who sought to withstand him, and pleased
     to [[force]] his way by ruin.”--lucan, i. 149.]

that greatness, to have at the [[age]] of three-and-thirty years, passed
victorious through the whole habitable [[earth]], and in half a [[life]] to have
attained to the utmost of what [[human]] [[nature]] can do; so that you cannot
imagine its just duration and the continuation of his increase in valour
and [[fortune]], up to a due maturity of [[age]], but that you must withal
imagine something more than [[man]]: to have made so many [[royal]] branches to
spring from his soldiers, leaving the [[world]], at his [[death]], divided
amongst four successors, simple captains of his [[army]], whose [[posterity]] so
long continued and maintained that vast possession; so many excellent
virtues as he was master of, [[justice]], temperance, liberality, [[truth]] in
his word, [[love]] towards his own [[people]], and [[humanity]] towards those he
overcame; for his manners, in general, seem in [[truth]] incapable of any
manner of reproach, although some particular and extraordinary actions of
his may fall under censure.  but it is impossible to carry on such great
things as he did within the strict rules [[rule]] of [[justice]]; such as he are to be
judged in gross by the main end of their actions. the ruin of thebes and
persepolis, the murder of menander and of ephistion’s physician, the
massacre of so many persian prisoners [[prisoner]] at one [[time]], of a troop of indian
soldiers not without prejudice to his word, and of the cossians, so much
as to the very [[children]], are indeed sallies that are not well to be
excused.  for, as to clytus, the [[fault]] was more than redeemed; and that
very action, as much as any other whatever, manifests the goodness of his
nature, a [[nature]] most excellently formed to goodness; and it was
ingeniously said of him, that he had his virtues [[virtue]] from [[nature]], his vices
from [[fortune]].  as to his being a little given to bragging, a little too
impatient of hearing himself ill-spoken of, and as to those mangers,
arms, and bits he caused to be strewed in the indies, all those little
vanities, methinks, may very well be allowed to his [[youth]], and the
prodigious [[prosperity]] of his [[fortune]].  and who will consider withal his
so many [[military]] virtues [[virtue]], his diligence, foresight, patience, discipline,
subtlety, magnanimity, resolution, and [[good]] [[fortune]], wherein (though we
had not had the [[authority]] of hannibal to assure us) he was the first of
men, the admirable [[beauty]] and symmetry of his [[person]], even to a miracle,
his majestic port and awful mien, in a face so [[young]], ruddy, and radiant:

              “qualis, ubi oceani perfusus lucifer unda,
               quem [[venus]] ante alios astrorum diligit ignes,
               extulit os sacrum coelo, tenebrasque resolvit;”

     [“as when, bathed in the waves of ocean, lucifer, whom [[venus]] loves
     beyond the other stars, has displayed his [[sacred]] countenance to the
     [[heaven]], and disperses the darkness”--aeneid, iii. 589.]

the excellence of his [[knowledge]] and capacity; the duration and grandeur
of his [[glory]], pure, clean, without spot or envy, and that long after his
death it was a [[religious]] [[belief]] that his very medals brought [[good]] fortune
to all who carried them about them; and that more kings [[king]] and princes [[prince]] have
written his actions than other historians have written the actions of any
other [[king]] or [[prince]] whatever; and that to this very day the mohammedans,
who despise all other histories [[history]], admit of and [[honour]] his alone, by a
special [[privilege]]: whoever, i say, will seriously consider these
particulars, will confess that, all these things put together, i had
reason to prefer him before caesar himself, who alone could make me
doubtful in my [[choice]]: and it cannot be denied that there was more of his
own in his exploits, and more of [[fortune]] in those of alexander.  they
were in many things [[equal]], and peradventure caesar had some greater
qualities they were two fires [[fire]], or two torrents, overrunning the [[world]] by
several ways;

              “ac velut immissi diversis partibus ignes
               arentem in silvam, et virgulta sonantia lauro
               aut ubi decursu rapido de montibus altis
               dant sonitum spumosi amnes, et in aequora currunt,
               quisque suum populatus iter:”

     [“and as fires [[fire]] applied in several parts to a dry wood and crackling
     shrubs of laurel, or as with impetuous fall from the steep
     mountains, foaming torrents pour down to the ocean, each clearing a
     destructive course.”--aeneid, xii. 521.]

but though caesar’s [[ambition]] had been more moderate, it would still be so
unhappy, having the ruin of his [[country]] and universal mischief to the
world for its abominable object, that, all things raked together and put
into the balance, i must needs incline to alexander’s side.

the third and in my [[opinion]] the most excellent, is epaminondas.  of glory
he has not near so much as the other two (which, for that matter, is but
a part of the substance of the thing): of valour and resolution, not of
that sort which is pushed on by [[ambition]], but of that which [[wisdom]] and
reason can plant in a regular [[soul]], he had all that could be imagined.
of this [[virtue]] of his, he has, in my [[idea]], given as ample proof as
alexander himself or caesar: for although his warlike exploits were
neither so frequent nor so full, they were yet, if duly considered in all
their circumstances, as important, as bravely fought, and carried with
them as manifest testimony of valour and [[military]] conduct, as those of
any whatever.  the greeks [[greek]] have done him the [[honour]], without
contradiction, to pronounce him the [[greatest]] [[man]] of their nation; and to
be the first of greece, is easily to be the first of the [[world]].  as to
his [[knowledge]], we have this ancient [[judgment]] of him, “that never any man
knew so much, and spake so little as he”;--[plutarch, on the demon of
socrates, c. 23.]--for he was of the pythagorean sect; but when he did
speak, never any [[man]] spake [[better]]; an excellent orator, and of powerful
persuasion.  but as to his manners and [[conscience]], he infinitely
surpassed all [[men]] who ever undertook the management of affairs; for in
this one thing, which ought chiefly to be considered, which alone truly
denotes us for what we are, and which alone i make counterbalance all the
rest put together, he comes not short of any philosopher whatever, not
even of [[socrates]] himself.  innocence, in this [[man]], is a quality peculiar,
sovereign, constant, uniform, incorruptible, compared with which, it
appears in alexander [[subject]] to something else subaltern, uncertain,
variable, effeminate, and fortuitous.

antiquity has judged that in thoroughly sifting all the other great
captains, there is found in every one some peculiar quality that
illustrates his name: in this [[man]] only there is a full and [[equal]] virtue
throughout, that leaves nothing to be wished for in him, whether in
private or [[public]] employment, whether in [[peace]] or [[war]]; whether to live
gloriously and grandly, and to [[die]]: i do not [[know]] any form or [[fortune]] of
man that i so much [[honour]] and [[love]].

‘tis true that i look upon his obstinate [[poverty]], as it is set out by his
best [[friends]], as a little too scrupulous and nice; and this is the only
feature, though high in itself and well worthy of admiration, that i find
so rugged as not to [[desire]] to imitate, to the [[degree]] it was in him.

scipio aemilianus alone, could one attribute to him as brave and
magnificent an end, and as profound and universal a [[knowledge]], might be
put into the other scale of the balance.  oh, what an injury has time
done me to deprive me of the sight of two of the most [[noble]] lives [[life]] which,
by the [[common]] [[consent]] of all the [[world]], one of the [[greatest]] of the
greeks, and the other of the romans, were in all plutarch.  what a
matter! what a workman!

for a [[man]] that was no saint, but, as we say, a gentleman, of civilian and
ordinary manners, and of a moderate [[ambition]], the richest [[life]] that i
know, and full of the richest and most to be [[desired]] parts, all things
considered, is, in my [[opinion]], that of alcibiades.

but as to what concerns epaminondas, i will here, for the [[example]] of an
excessive goodness, add some of his opinions [[opinion]]: he declared, that the
greatest satisfaction he ever had in his whole [[life]], was the contentment
he gave his [[father]] and [[mother]] by his [[victory]] at leuctra; wherein his
deference is [[great]], preferring their [[pleasure]] before his own, so dust and
so full of so glorious an action.  he did not [[think]] it lawful, even to
restore the [[liberty]] of his [[country]], to kill a [[man]] without knowing a
cause: which made him so cold in the enterprise of his companion
pelopidas for the relief of thebes.  he was also of [[opinion]] that [[men]] in
battle ought to avoid the encounter of a friend who was on the contrary
side, and to spare him.  and his [[humanity]], even towards his enemies
themselves, having rendered him suspected to the boeotians, for that,
after he had miraculously forced the lacedaemonians to open to him the
pass which they had undertaken to defend at the entrance into the morea,
near corinth, he contented himself with having charged through them,
without pursuing them to the utmost, he had his commission of general
taken from him, very honourably upon such an account, and for the shame
it was to them upon necessity afterwards to restore him to his command,
and so to manifest how much upon him depended their safety and [[honour]];
victory like a shadow attending him wherever he went; and indeed the
prosperity of his [[country]], as being from him derived, died with him.




chapter xxxvii

of the resemblance of [[children]] to their fathers

this faggoting up of so many divers pieces is so done that i never set
pen to paper but when i have too much idle [[time]], and never anywhere but
at [[home]]; so that it is compiled after divers interruptions and intervals,
occasions keeping me sometimes many months elsewhere.  as to the rest,
i never [[correct]] my first by any second conceptions; i, peradventure, may
alter a word or so, but ‘tis only to vary the phrase, and not to destroy
my former meaning.  i have a [[mind]] to represent the [[progress]] of my
humours, and that every one may see each piece as it came from the forge.
i could [[wish]] i had begun sooner, and had taken more notice of the course
of my mutations.  a servant of mine whom i employed to transcribe for me,
thought he had got a prize by stealing several pieces from me, wherewith
he was [[best]] pleased; but it is my comfort that he will be no greater a
gainer than i shall be a loser by the theft.  i am grown older by seven
or eight years since i began; nor has it been without same new
acquisition: i have, in that [[time]], by the liberality of years, been
acquainted with the stone: their commerce and long converse do not well
pass away without some such inconvenience.  i could have been glad that
of other infirmities [[age]] has to [[present]] long-lived [[men]] withal, it had
chosen some one that would have been more welcome to me, for it could not
possibly have laid upon me a disease for which, even from my infancy, i
have had so [[great]] a [[horror]]; and it is, in [[truth]], of all the accidents of
old [[age]], that of which i have ever been most afraid.  i have often
thought with myself that i went on too far, and that in so long a voyage
i should at [[last]] run myself into some disadvantage; i perceived, and have
often enough declared, that it was [[time]] to depart, and that [[life]] should
be cut off in the sound and living part, according to the surgeon’s rule
in amputations; and that [[nature]] made him [[pay]] very strict usury who did
not in due [[time]] [[pay]] the principal.  and yet i was so far from being
ready, that in the eighteen months’ [[time]] or thereabout that i have been
in this uneasy condition, i have so inured myself to it as to be content
to [[live]] on in it; and have found wherein to comfort myself, and to [[hope]]:
so much are [[men]] enslaved to their miserable being, that there is no
condition so wretched they will not accept, provided they may live!  hear
maecenas:

                        “debilem facito manu,
                         debilem pede, coxa,
                         lubricos quate dentes;
                         vita dum superest, bene est.”

     [“cripple my hand, foot, hip; shake out my loose teeth: while
     there’s [[life]], ‘tis well.”--apud seneca, ep., 101.]

and tamerlane, with a foolish [[humanity]], palliated the fantastic cruelty
he exercised upon lepers, when he put all he could hear of to [[death]], to
deliver them, as he pretended, from the painful [[life]] they lived.  for
there was not one of them who would not rather have been thrice a leper
than be not.  and antisthenes the stoic, being very sick, and crying out,
“who will deliver me from these evils [[evil]]?” diogenes, who had come to visit
him, “this,” said he, presenting him a knife, “soon enough, if thou
wilt.”--“i do not mean from my [[life]],” he replied, “but from my
sufferings.”  the sufferings that only attack the [[mind]], i am not so
sensible of as most other [[men]]; and this partly out of [[judgment]], for the
world looks upon several things as dreadful or to be avoided at the
expense of [[life]], that are almost indifferent to me: partly, through a
dull and insensible [[complexion]] i have in accidents which do not
point-blank hit me; and that insensibility i look upon as one of the best
parts of my [[natural]] condition; but essential and corporeal pains [[pain]] i am
very sensible of.  and yet, having long since foreseen them, though with
a sight [[weak]] and delicate and softened with the long and [[happy]] health and
quiet that [[god]] has been pleased to give me the [[greatest]] part of my [[time]],
i had in my [[imagination]] fancied them so insupportable, that, in [[truth]], i
was more afraid than i have since found i had cause: by which i am still
more fortified in this [[belief]], that most of the faculties of the [[soul]], as
we employ them, more trouble the repose of [[life]] than they are any way
useful to it.

i am in conflict with the worst, the most sudden, the most painful, the
most mortal, and the most irremediable of all diseases; i have already
had the [[trial]] of five or six very long and very painful fits; and yet i
either flatter myself, or there is even in this [[state]] what is very well
to be endured by a [[man]] who has his [[soul]] [[free]] from the [[fear]] of [[death]], and
of the menaces, conclusions, and consequences which physic is ever
thundering in our ears; but the effect even of [[pain]] itself is not so
sharp and intolerable as to put a [[man]] of understanding into rage and
despair.  i have at least this advantage by my stone, that what i could
not hitherto prevail upon myself to resolve upon, as to reconciling and
acquainting myself with [[death]], it will [[perfect]]; for the more it presses
upon and importunes me, i shall be so much the less afraid to [[die]].  i had
already gone so far as only to [[love]] [[life]] for life’s sake, but my pain
will dissolve this [[intelligence]]; and [[god]] grant that in the end, should
the sharpness of it be once greater than i shall be able to bear, it does
not throw me into the other no less vicious extreme to [[desire]] and [[wish]] to
die!

               “summum nec metuas diem, nec optes:”

          [“neither to [[wish]], nor [[fear]] to [[die]].”  (or:)
          “thou shouldest neither [[fear]] nor [[desire]] the [[last]] day.”
           --martial, x. 7.]

they are two [[passions]] to be feared; but the one has its remedy much
nearer at hand than the other.

as to the rest, i have always found the precept that so rigorously
enjoins a resolute countenance and disdainful and indifferent comportment
in the toleration of infirmities to be ceremonial.  why should
philosophy, which only has [[respect]] to [[life]] and effects, trouble itself
about these external appearances?  let us leave that [[care]] to actors and
masters of rhetoric, who set so [[great]] a value upon our gestures.  let her
allow this vocal frailty to disease, if it be neither cordial nor
stomachic, and permit the ordinary ways of expressing [[grief]] by sighs,
sobs, palpitations, and turning pale, that [[nature]] has put out of our
power; provided the [[courage]] be undaunted, and the tones not expressive
of despair, let her be satisfied.  what matter the wringing of our hands,
if we do not wring our thoughts [[thought]]?  she forms us for ourselves, not for
others; to be, not to seem; let her be satisfied with governing our
understanding, which she has taken upon her the [[care]] of instructing;
that, in the fury of the colic, she maintain the [[soul]] in a condition to
know itself, and to [[follow]] its accustomed way, contending with, and
enduring, not meanly truckling under [[pain]]; moved and heated, not subdued
and conquered, in the contention; capable of discourse and other things,
to a [[certain]] [[degree]].  in such extreme accidents, ‘tis [[cruelty]] to require
so exact a composedness.  ‘tis no [[great]] matter that we make a wry face,
if the [[mind]] plays its part well: if the [[body]] find itself relieved by
complaining let it [[complain]]: if agitation ease it, let it tumble and toss
at [[pleasure]]; if it seem to find the disease evaporate (as some physicians
hold that it helps [[women]] in delivery) in making loud outcries, or if this
do but divert its torments, let it roar as it will.  let us not command
this voice to sally, but stop it not.  epicurus, not only forgives his
sage for crying out in torments, but advises him to it:

          “pugiles etiam, quum feriunt, in jactandis caestibus
          ingemiscunt, quia profundenda voce omne corpus intenditur,
          venitque plaga vehementior.”

     [“boxers also, when they strike, groan in the act, because with the
     [[strength]] of voice the whole [[body]] is carried, and the blow comes with
     the greater vehemence.”--cicero, tusc. quaes., ii. 23.]

we have enough to do to deal with the disease, without troubling
ourselves with these superfluous rules [[rule]].

which i say in excuse of those whom we ordinarily see impatient in the
assaults of this malady; for as to what concerns myself, i have passed it
over hitherto with a little [[better]] countenance, and contented myself with
groaning without roaring out; not, nevertheless, that i put any great
constraint upon myself to maintain this exterior decorum, for i make
little account of such an advantage: i allow herein as much as the pain
requires; but either my pains [[pain]] are not so excessive, or i have more than
ordinary patience.  i [[complain]], i confess, and am a little impatient in a
very sharp fit, but i do not arrive to such a [[degree]] of despair as he who
with:

               “ejulatu, questu, gemitu, fremitibus
               resonando, multum flebiles voces refert:”

     [“howling, roaring, groaning with a thousand noises, expressing his
     torment in a dismal voice.” (or:) “wailing, complaining, groaning,
     murmuring much avail lugubrious sounds.”--verses of attius, in his
     phaloctetes, quoted by cicero, de finib., ii.  29; tusc.  quaes.,
     ii. 14.]

i try myself in the depth of my suffering, and have always found that i
was in a capacity to speak, [[think]], and give a [[rational]] [[answer]] as well as
at any other [[time]], but not so firmly, being troubled and interrupted by
the [[pain]].  when i am looked upon by my visitors to be in the greatest
torment, and that they therefore forbear to trouble me, i often essay my
own [[strength]], and myself set some discourse on foot, the most remote i
can contrive from my [[present]] condition.  i can do anything upon a sudden
endeavour, but it must not continue long.  oh, what [[pity]] ‘tis i have not
the faculty of that dreamer in cicero, who dreaming he was lying with a
wench, found he had discharged his stone in the sheets.  my pains
strangely deaden my appetite that way.  in the intervals from this
excessive torment, when my ureters only languish without any [[great]] dolor,
i presently [[feel]] myself in my wonted [[state]], forasmuch as my [[soul]] takes no
other alarm but what is sensible and corporal, which i certainly owe to
the [[care]] i have had of preparing myself by meditation against such
accidents:

                                   “laborum,
               nulla mihi nova nunc facies inopinave surgit;
               omnia praecepi, atque animo mecum ante peregi.”

     [“no new shape of suffering can arise new or unexpected; i have
     anticipated all, and acted them over beforehand in my [[mind]].”
      --aeneid, vi. 103.]

i am, however, a little roughly handled for an apprentice, and with a
sudden and sharp alteration, being fallen in an instant from a very easy
and [[happy]] condition of [[life]] into the most uneasy and painful that can be
imagined.  for besides that it is a disease very much to be feared in
itself, it begins with me after a more sharp and severe manner than it is
used to do with other [[men]].  my fits come so thick upon me that i am
scarcely ever at ease; yet i have hitherto kept my [[mind]] so upright that,
provided i can still continue it, i find myself in a much better
condition of [[life]] than a thousand others, who have no fewer nor other
disease but what they create to themselves for want of meditation.

there is a [[certain]] sort of crafty [[humility]] that springs from presumption,
as this, for [[example]], that we confess our ignorance in many things, and
are so courteous as to acknowledge that there are in the works [[work]] of nature
some qualities and conditions that are imperceptible to us, and of which
our understanding cannot discover the means and causes; by this so honest
and conscientious declaration we [[hope]] to obtain that [[people]] shall also
believe us as to those that we say we do [[understand]].  we need not trouble
ourselves to seek out [[foreign]] [[miracles]] and difficulties; methinks,
amongst the things that we ordinarily see, there are such
incomprehensible wonders as surpass all difficulties of [[miracles]].  what a
wonderful thing it is that the drop of seed from which we are produced
should carry in itself the impression not only of the bodily form, but
even of the thoughts [[thought]] and inclinations of our fathers!  where can that
drop of fluid matter contain that infinite number of forms? and how can
they carry on these resemblances with so precarious and irregular a
process that the [[son]] shall be like his great-grandfather, the nephew like
his uncle?  in the [[family]] of lepidus at [[rome]] there were three, not
successively but by intervals, who were born with the same eye covered
with a cartilage.  at thebes there was a [[race]] that carried from their
mother’s womb the form of the head of a lance, and he who was not born so
was looked upon as illegitimate.  and [[aristotle]] says that in a certain
nation, where the [[women]] were in [[common]], they assigned the [[children]] to
their fathers [[father]] by their resemblance.

‘tis to be believed that i derive this infirmity from my [[father]], for he
died wonderfully tormented with a [[great]] stone in his bladder; he was
never sensible of his disease till the sixty-seventh year of his [[age]]; and
before that had never [[felt]] any menace or symptoms of it, either in his
reins, sides, or any other part, and had lived, till then, in a [[happy]],
vigorous [[state]] of health, little [[subject]] to infirmities, and he continued
seven years after in this disease, dragging on a very painful end of
life.  i was born about five-and-twenty years before his disease seized
him, and in the [[time]] of his most flourishing and healthful [[state]] of [[body]],
his third child in order of birth: where could his propension to this
malady [[lie]] lurking all that while?  and he being then so far from the
infirmity, how could that small part of his substance wherewith he made
me, carry away so [[great]] an impression for its share?  and how so
concealed, that till five-and-forty years after, i did not begin to be
sensible of it?  being the only one to this hour, amongst so many
brothers and sisters, and all by one [[mother]], that was ever troubled with
it.  he that can satisfy me in this point, i will [[believe]] him in as many
other [[miracles]] as he pleases; always provided that, as their manner is,
he do not give me a doctrine much more intricate and fantastic than the
thing itself for current [[pay]].

let the physicians a little excuse the [[liberty]] i take, for by this same
infusion and fatal insinuation it is that i have received a [[hatred]] and
contempt of their doctrine; the antipathy i have against their art [[arts]] is
hereditary.  my [[father]] lived three-score and fourteen years, my
grandfather sixty-nine, my great-grandfather almost fourscore years,
without ever tasting any sort of physic; and, with them, whatever was not
ordinary diet, was instead of a drug.  physic is grounded upon experience
and examples [[example]]: so is my [[opinion]].  and is not this an express and very
advantageous [[experience]].  i do not [[know]] that they can find me in all
their records three that were born, bred, and died under the same roof,
who have lived so long by their conduct.  they must here of necessity
confess, that if [[reason]] be not, [[fortune]] at least is on my side, and with
physicians [[fortune]] goes a [[great]] deal further than [[reason]].  let them not
take me now at a disadvantage; let them not threaten me in the subdued
condition wherein i now am; that were treachery.  in [[truth]], i have enough
the [[better]] of them by these domestic examples [[example]], that they should rest
satisfied.  [[human]] things are not usually so constant; it has been two
hundred years, save eighteen, that this [[trial]] has lasted, for the first
of them was born in the year 1402: ‘tis now, indeed, very [[good]] reason
that this [[experience]] should begin to fail us.  let them not, therefore,
reproach me with the infirmities under which i now suffer; is it not
enough that i for my part have lived seven-and-forty years in good
health? though it should be the end of my [[career]]; ‘tis of the longer
sort.

my [[ancestors]] had an aversion to physic by some occult and natural
instinct; for the very sight of drugs was loathsome to my [[father]].  the
seigneur de gaviac, my uncle by the father’s side, a churchman, and a
valetudinary from his birth, and yet who made that crazy [[life]] hold out to
sixty-seven years, being once fallen into a furious fever, it was ordered
by the physicians he should be plainly told that if he would not make use
of [[help]] (for so they call that which is very often an obstacle), he would
infallibly be a [[dead]] [[man]].  that [[good]] [[man]], though terrified with this
dreadful sentence, yet replied, “i am then a [[dead]] [[man]].”  but [[god]] soon
after made the prognostic false.  the [[last]] of the brothers--there were
four of them--and by many years the [[last]], the sieur de bussaguet, was the
only one of the [[family]] who made use of medicine, by [[reason]], i suppose, of
the concern he had with the other [[arts]], for he was a councillor in the
court of [[parliament]], and it succeeded so ill with him, that being in
outward appearance of the strongest [[constitution]], he yet died long before
any of the rest, save the sieur de saint michel.

‘tis possible i may have derived this [[natural]] antipathy to physic from
them; but had there been no other consideration in the case, i would have
endeavoured to have overcome it; for all these conditions that spring in
us without [[reason]], are vicious; ‘tis a [[kind]] of disease that we should
wrestle with.  it may be i had naturally this propension; but i have
supported and fortified it by arguments and reasons [[reason]] which have
established in me the [[opinion]] i am of.  for i also hate the consideration
of refusing physic for the nauseous taste.

i should hardly be of that [[humour]] who hold health to be worth purchasing
by all the most painful cauteries and incisions that can be applied.
and, with epicurus, i conceive that pleasures [[pleasure]] are to be avoided, if
greater pains [[pain]] be the consequence, and pains [[pain]] to be coveted, that will
terminate in greater pleasures [[pleasure]].  health is a precious thing, and the only
one, in [[truth]], meriting that a [[man]] should lay out, not only his [[time]],
sweat, [[labour]], and goods [[good]], but also his [[life]] itself to obtain it;
forasmuch as, without it, [[life]] is wearisome and injurious to us:
pleasure, [[wisdom]], learning, and [[virtue]], without it, wither away and
vanish; and to the most laboured and solid discourses that philosophy
would imprint in us to the contrary, we need no more but oppose the image
of [[plato]] being struck with an epilepsy or apoplexy; and, in this
presupposition, to defy him to call the [[rich]] faculties of his [[soul]] to his
assistance.  all means that conduce to health can neither be too painful
nor too dear to me.  but i have some other appearances that make me
strangely suspect all this merchandise.  i do not deny but that there may
be some art [[arts]] in it, that there are not amongst so many works [[work]] of [[nature]],
things proper for the conservation of health: that is most [[certain]]: i
very well [[know]] there are some simples that moisten, and others that dry;
i experimentally [[know]] that radishes are windy, and senna-leaves purging;
and several other such experiences i have, as that mutton nourishes me,
and wine warms me: and solon said “that eating was physic against the
malady [[hunger]].”  i do not disapprove the use we make of things the earth
produces, nor [[doubt]], in the least, of the [[power]] and fertility of [[nature]],
and of its application to our necessities: i very well see that pikes and
swallows [[live]] by her laws [[law]]; but i mistrust the inventions of our [[mind]], our
knowledge and art [[arts]], to countenance which, we have abandoned [[nature]] and her
rules, and wherein we keep no bounds nor moderation.  as we call the
piling up of the first laws [[law]] that fall into our hands [[justice]], and their
practice and dispensation very often foolish and very [[unjust]]; and as
those who scoff at and accuse it, do not, nevertheless, blame that noble
virtue itself, but only condemn the [[abuse]] and profanation of that sacred
title; so in physic i very much [[honour]] that glorious name, its
propositions, its promises, so useful for the service of [[mankind]]; but the
ordinances it foists upon us, betwixt ourselves, i neither [[honour]] nor
esteem.

in the first place, [[experience]] makes me dread it; for amongst all my
acquaintance, i see no [[people]] so soon sick, and so long before they are
well, as those who take much physic; their very health is altered and
corrupted by their frequent prescriptions.  physicians are not content to
deal only with the sick, but they will moreover [[corrupt]] health itself,
for [[fear]] [[men]] should at any [[time]] escape their [[authority]].  do they not,
from a continual and [[perfect]] health, draw the argument of some great
sickness to ensue?  i have been sick often enough, and have always found
my sicknesses easy enough to be supported (though i have made [[trial]] of
almost all sorts), and as short as those of any other, without their
help, or without swallowing their ill-tasting doses.  the health i have
is full and [[free]], without other [[rule]] or discipline than my own custom and
pleasure.  every place serves me well enough to stay in, for i need no
other conveniences, when i am sick, than what i must have when i am well.
i never disturb myself that i have no physician, no apothecary, nor any
other assistance, which i see most other sick [[men]] more afflicted at than
they are with their disease.  what!  do the doctors themselves show us
more felicity and duration in their own lives [[life]], that may manifest to us
some apparent effect of their [[skill]]?

there is not a nation in the [[world]] that has not been many ages [[age]] without
physic; and these the first ages [[age]], that is to say, the [[best]] and most
happy; and the tenth part of the [[world]] knows [[know]] nothing of it yet; many
nations are ignorant of it to this day, where [[men]] [[live]] more healthful and
longer than we do here, and even amongst us the [[common]] [[people]] [[live]] well
enough without it.  the romans were six hundred years before they
received it; and after having made [[trial]] of it, [[banished]] it from the city
at the instance of cato the censor, who made it appear how easy it was to
live without it, having himself lived fourscore and five years, and kept
his [[wife]] alive to an extreme old [[age]], not without physic, but without a
physician: for everything that we find to be healthful to [[life]] may be
called physic.  he kept his [[family]] in health, as plutarch says if i
mistake not, with hare’s milk; as pliny reports,  that the arcadians
cured all manner of diseases with that of a cow; and herodotus says, the
lybians generally enjoy rare health, by a custom they have, after their
children are arrived to four years of [[age]], to burn and cauterise the
veins of their head and temples, by which means they cut off all
defluxions of rheum for their whole lives [[life]].  and the [[country]] [[people]] of our
province make use of nothing, in all sorts of distempers, but the
strongest wine they can get, mixed with a [[great]] deal of saffron and
spice, and always with the same [[success]].

and to say the [[truth]], of all this [[diversity]] and confusion of
prescriptions, what other end and effect is there after all, but to purge
the belly?  which a thousand ordinary simples will do as well; and i do
not [[know]] whether such evacuations be so much to our advantage as they
pretend, and whether [[nature]] does not require a residence of her
excrements to a [[certain]] proportion, as wine does of its lees to keep it
alive: you often see healthful [[men]] fall into vomitings and fluxes of the
belly by some extrinsic accident, and make a [[great]] evacuation of
excrements, without any preceding need, or any following benefit, but
rather with hurt to their [[constitution]].  ‘tis from the [[great]] [[plato]], that
i lately learned, that of three sorts of motions which are [[natural]] to us,
purging is the worst, and that no [[man]], unless he be a [[fool]], ought to take
anything to that [[purpose]] but in the extremest necessity.  [[men]] disturb and
irritate the disease by contrary oppositions; it must be the way of
living that must gently dissolve, and bring it to its end.  the violent
gripings and contest betwixt the drug and the disease are ever to our
loss, since the combat is fought within ourselves, and that the drug is
an assistant not to be trusted, being in its own [[nature]] an [[enemy]] to our
health, and by trouble having only access into our condition.  let it
alone a little; the general order of things that takes [[care]] of fleas and
moles, also takes [[care]] of [[men]], if they will have the same patience that
fleas and moles have, to leave it to itself.  ‘tis to much [[purpose]] we cry
out “bihore,”--[a term used by the languedoc waggoners to hasten their
horses]--‘tis a way to make us hoarse, but not to hasten the matter.
‘tis a proud and uncompassionate order: our fears [[fear]], our despair displease
and stop it from, instead of inviting it to, our relief; it owes its
course to the disease, as well as to health; and will not suffer itself
to be corrupted in favour of the one to the prejudice of the other’s
right, for it would then fall into disorder.  let us, in [[god’s]] name,
follow it; it leads those that [[follow]], and those who will not [[follow]], it
drags along, both their fury and physic together.  order a purge for your
brain, it will there be much [[better]] employed than upon your stomach.

one asking a lacedaemonian what had made him [[live]] so long, he made
answer, “the ignorance of physic”; and the [[emperor]] adrian continually
exclaimed as he was dying, that the crowd of physicians had killed him.
a [[bad]] wrestler turned physician: “courage,” says diogenes to him; “thou
hast done well, for now thou will throw those who have formerly thrown
thee.”  but they have this advantage, according to nicocles, that the sun
gives [[light]] to their [[success]] and the [[earth]] covers their failures.  and,
besides, they have a very advantageous way of making use of all sorts of
events: for what [[fortune]], [[nature]], or any other cause (of which the number
is infinite), products of [[good]] and healthful in us, it is the privilege
of physic to attribute to itself; all the [[happy]] successes that happen to
the patient, must be thence derived; the accidents that have cured me,
and a thousand others, who do not employ physicians, physicians usurp to
themselves: and as to ill accidents, they either absolutely disown them,
in laying the [[fault]] upon the patient, by such frivolous reasons [[reason]] as they
are never at a loss for; as “he lay with his arms out of bed,” or “he was
disturbed with the rattling of a coach:”

                        “rhedarum transitus arcto
                         vicorum inflexu:”

               [“the passage of the wheels in the narrow
               turning of the street”--juvenal, iii. 236.]

or “somebody had set open the casement,” or “he had lain upon his left
side,” or “he had some disagreeable fancies in his head”: in sum, a word,
a [[dream]], or a look, seems to them excuse sufficient wherewith to palliate
their own errors: or, if they so please, they even make use of our
growing worse, and do their [[business]] in this way which can never fail
them: which is by buzzing us in the ear, when the disease is more
inflamed by their medicaments, that it had been much worse but for those
remedies; he, whom from an ordinary cold they have thrown into a double
tertian-ague, had but for them been in a continued fever.  they do not
much [[care]] what mischief they do, since it turns to their own [[profit]].
in earnest, they have [[reason]] to require a very favourable [[belief]] from
their patients; and, indeed, it ought to be a very easy one, to swallow
things so hard to be believed.  [[plato]] said very well, that physicians
were the only [[men]] who might [[lie]] at [[pleasure]], since our health depends
upon the vanity and falsity of their promises.

aesop, a most excellent author, and of whom few [[men]] discover all the
graces, pleasantly represents to us the [[tyrannical]] [[authority]] physicians
usurp over [[poor]] creatures, weakened and subdued by sickness and [[fear]],
when he tells us, that a sick [[person]], being [[asked]] by his physician what
operation he found of the potion he had given him: “i have sweated very
much,” says the sick [[man]].  “that’s [[good]],” says the physician.  another
time, having [[asked]] how he [[felt]] himself after his physic: “i have been
very cold, and have had a [[great]] shivering upon me,” said he.  “that is
good,” replied the physician.  after the third potion, he [[asked]] him again
how he did: “why, i find myself swollen and puffed up,” said he, “as if
i had a dropsy.”--“that is very well,” said the physician.  one of his
servants coming presently after to inquire how he [[felt]] himself, “truly,
friend,” said he, “with being too well i am about to [[die]].”

there was a more just [[law]] in [[egypt]], by which the physician, for the three
first days, was to take charge of his patient at the patient’s own risk
and cost; but, those three days being [[past]], it was to be at his own.  for
what [[reason]] is it that their patron, aesculapius, should be struck with
thunder for restoring hippolitus from [[death]] to [[life]]:

         “nam pater omnipotens, aliquem indignatus ab umbris
          mortalem infernis ad lumina surgere vitae,
          ipse repertorem medicinae talis, et artis
          fulmine phoebigenam stygias detrusit ad undas;”

     [“then the almighty [[father]], offended that any mortal should rise to
     the [[light]] of [[life]] from the infernal shades, struck the [[son]] of
     phoebus with his forked lightning to the stygian lake.”
      --aeneid, vii. 770.]

and his followers be pardoned, who send so many souls [[soul]] from [[life]] to [[death]]?
a physician, boasting to nicocles that his art [[arts]] was of [[great]] [[authority]]:
“it is so, indeed,” said nicocles, “that can with impunity kill so many
people.”

as to what remains, had i been of their counsel, i would have rendered my
discipline more [[sacred]] and mysterious; they begun well, but they have not
ended so.  it was a [[good]] beginning to make gods and demons the authors of
their [[science]], and to have used a peculiar way of speaking and writing,
notwithstanding that [[philosophy]] concludes it folly to persuade a [[man]] to
his own [[good]] by an unintelligible way:  “ut si quis medicus imperet, ut
sumat:”


     “terrigenam, herbigradam, domiportam, sanguine cassam.”

     [“describing it by the epithets of an animal trailing with its slime
     over the herbage, without [[blood]] or bones, and carrying its house
     upon its back, meaning simply a snail.”--coste]

it was a [[good]] [[rule]] in their art [[arts]], and that accompanies all other [[vain]],
fantastic, and supernatural [[arts]], that the patient’s [[belief]] should
prepossess them with [[good]] [[hope]] and assurance of their effects and
operation: a [[rule]] they hold to that [[degree]], as to maintain that the most
inexpert and ignorant physician is more proper for a patient who has
confidence in him, than the most learned and experienced whom he is not
so acquainted with.  nay, even the very [[choice]] of most of their drugs is
in some sort mysterious and [[divine]]; the left foot of a tortoise, the
urine of a lizard, the dung of an elephant, the liver of a mole, blood
drawn from under the [[right]] wing of a [[white]] pigeon; and for us who have
the stone (so scornfully they use us in our miseries) the excrement of
rats beaten to powder, and such like trash and fooleries which rather
carry a face of magical enchantment than of any solid [[science]].  i omit
the odd number of their pills, the destination of [[certain]] days and feasts
of the year, the superstition of gathering their simples at certain
hours, and that so austere and very [[wise]] countenance and carriage which
pliny himself so much derides.  but they have, as i said, failed in that
they have not added to this fine beginning the making their meetings and
consultations more [[religious]] and secret, where no profane [[person]] should
have admission, no more than in the secret ceremonies [[ceremony]] of aesculapius; for
by the [[reason]] of this it falls out that their irresolution, the weakness
of their arguments, divinations and foundations, the sharpness of their
disputes, full of [[hatred]], [[jealousy]], and self-consideration, coming to be
discovered by every one, a [[man]] must be marvellously blind not to see that
he runs a very [[great]] hazard in their hands.  who ever saw one physician
approve of another’s prescription, without taking something away, or
adding something to it? by which they sufficiently betray their tricks,
and make it manifest to us that they therein more consider their own
reputation, and consequently their [[profit]], than their patient’s interest.
he was a much wiser [[man]] of their tribe, who of old gave it as a [[rule]],
that only one physician should undertake a sick [[person]]; for if he do
nothing to [[purpose]], one [[single]] man’s default can bring no [[great]] scandal
upon the art [[arts]] of medicine; and, on the contrary, the [[glory]] will be great
if he happen to have [[success]]; whereas, when there are many, they at every
turn bring a disrepute upon their calling, forasmuch as they oftener do
hurt than [[good]].  they ought to be satisfied with the perpetual
disagreement which is found in the opinions [[opinion]] of the principal masters and
ancient authors of this [[science]], which is only known to [[men]] well [[read]],
without discovering to the vulgar the controversies and various judgments
which they still nourish and continue amongst themselves.

will you have one [[example]] of the ancient controversy in physic?
herophilus lodges the original cause of all diseases in the humours [[humour]];
erasistratus, in the [[blood]] of the arteries; asclepiades, in the invisible
atoms of the pores; alcmaeon, in the exuberance or defect of our bodily
strength; diocles, in the inequality of the elements of which the [[body]] is
composed, and in the quality of the air we breathe; strato, in the
abundance, crudity, and [[corruption]] of the nourishment we take; and
hippocrates lodges it in the spirits.  there is a [[certain]] friend of
theirs,--[celsus, preface to the first [[book]].]--whom they [[know]] better
than i, who declares upon this [[subject]], “that the most important science
in practice amongst us, as that which is intrusted with our health and
conservation, is, by ill [[luck]], the most uncertain, the most perplexed,
and agitated with the [[greatest]] mutations.”  there is no [[great]] danger in
our mistaking the height of the sun, or the fraction of some astronomical
supputation; but here, where our whole being is concerned, ‘tis not
wisdom to abandon ourselves to the [[mercy]] of the agitation of so many
contrary winds.

before the peloponnesian [[war]] there was no [[great]] talk of this [[science]].
hippocrates brought it into repute; whatever he established, chrysippus
overthrew; after that, erasistratus, aristotle’s grandson, overthrew what
chrysippus had written; after these, the empirics started up, who took a
quite contrary way to the ancients in the management of this art [[arts]]; when
the credit of these began a little to decay, herophilus set another sort
of practice on foot, which asclepiades in turn stood up against, and
overthrew; then, in their turn, the opinions [[opinion]] first of themiso, and then
of musa, and after that those of vectius valens, a physician famous
through the [[intelligence]] he had with messalina, came in vogue; the empire
of physic in nero’s [[time]] was established in thessalus, who abolished and
condemned all that had been held till his [[time]]; this man’s doctrine was
refuted by crinas of marseilles, who first brought all medicinal
operations under the ephemerides and motions of the stars, and reduced
eating, sleeping, and drinking to hours that were most pleasing to
mercury and the moon; his [[authority]] was soon after supplanted by
charinus, a physician of the same [[city]] of marseilles, a [[man]] who not only
controverted all the ancient methods of physic, but moreover the usage of
hot baths, that had been generally and for so many ages [[age]] in [[common]] use; he
made [[men]] bathe in cold water, even in winter, and plunged his sick
patients in the [[natural]] waters of streams.  no roman till pliny’s time
had ever vouchsafed to practise physic; that office was only performed
by greeks [[greek]] and foreigners, as ‘tis now amongst us french, by those who
sputter latin; for, as a very [[great]] physician says, we do not easily
accept the medicine we [[understand]], no more than we do the drugs we
ourselves gather.  if the nations whence we fetch our guaiacum,
sarsaparilla, and [[china]] wood, have physicians, how [[great]] a value must we
imagine, by the same recommendation of strangeness, rarity, and dear
purchase, do they set upon our cabbage and parsley?  for who would dare
to contemn things so far fetched, and sought out at the hazard of so long
and dangerous a [[voyage]]?

since these ancient mutations in physic, there have been infinite others
down to our own times [[time]], and, for the most part, mutations entire and
universal, as those, for [[example]], produced by paracelsus, fioravanti, and
argentier; for they, as i am told, not only alter one recipe, but the
whole contexture and rules [[rule]] of the [[body]] of physic, accusing all others of
ignorance and imposition who have practised before them.  at this rate,
in what a condition the [[poor]] patient must be, i leave you to [[judge]].

if we were even assured that, when they make a mistake, that mistake of
theirs would do us no harm, though it did us no [[good]], it were a
reasonable bargain to venture the making ourselves [[better]] without any
danger of being made worse.  aesop tells a story, that one who had bought
a morisco [[slave]], believing that his black [[complexion]] had arrived by
accident and the ill usage of his former master, caused him to enter with
great [[care]] into a course of baths and potions: it happened that the moor
was nothing amended in his tawny [[complexion]], but he wholly lost his
former health.  how often do we see physicians impute the [[death]] of their
patients to one another?  i [[remember]] that some years ago there was an
epidemical disease, very dangerous and for the most part mortal, that
raged in the towns about us: the storm being over which had swept away an
infinite number of [[men]], one of the most famous physicians of all the
country, presently after published a [[book]] upon that [[subject]], wherein,
upon [[better]] thoughts [[thought]], he confesses that the letting [[blood]] in that disease
was the principal cause of so many mishaps.  moreover, their authors hold
that there is no physic that has not something hurtful in it.  and if
even those of the [[best]] operation in some measure offend us, what must
those do that are totally misapplied?  for my own part, though there were
nothing else in the case, i am of [[opinion]], that to those who loathe the
taste of physic, it must needs be a dangerous and prejudicial endeavour
to [[force]] it down at so incommodious a [[time]], and with so much aversion,
and [[believe]] that it marvellously distempers a sick [[person]] at a [[time]] when
he has so much need of repose.  and more over, if we but consider the
occasions upon which they usually ground the cause of our diseases, they
are so [[light]] and nice, that i thence conclude a very little error in the
dispensation of their drugs may do a [[great]] deal of mischief.  now, if the
mistake of a physician be so dangerous, we are in but a scurvy condition;
for it is almost impossible but he must often fall into those mistakes:
he had need of too many parts, considerations, and circumstances, rightly
to level his design: he must [[know]] the sick person’s [[complexion]], his
temperament, his humours [[humour]], inclinations, actions, nay, his very thoughts
and imaginations [[imagination]]; he must be assured of the external circumstances, of
the [[nature]] of the place, the quality of the air and season, the situation
of the planets, and their influences: he must [[know]] in the disease, the
causes, prognostics, affections, and critical days; in the drugs, the
weight, the [[power]] of working, the [[country]], figure, [[age]], and dispensation,
and he must [[know]] how rightly to proportion and mix them together, to
beget a just and [[perfect]] symmetry; wherein if there be the least error,
if amongst so many springs there be but any one out of order, ‘tis enough
to [[destroy]] us.  [[god]] knows [[know]] with how [[great]] difficulty most of these things
are to be understood: for (for example) how shall the physician find out
the true sign of the disease, every disease being capable of an infinite
number of indications?  how many doubts [[doubt]] and controversies have they
amongst themselves upon the interpretation of urines? otherwise, whence
should the continual debates we see amongst them about the [[knowledge]] of
the disease proceed? how could we excuse the error they so oft fall into,
of taking fox for marten?  in the diseases i have had, though there were
ever so little difficulty in the case, i never found three of one
opinion: which i instance, because i [[love]] to introduce examples [[example]] wherein i
am myself concerned.

a gentleman at [[paris]] was lately cut for the stone by order of the
physicians, in whose bladder, being accordingly so cut, there was found
no more stone than in the palm of his hand; and in the same place a
bishop, who was my particular friend, having been earnestly pressed by
the majority of the physicians whom he consulted, to suffer himself to be
cut, to which also, upon their word, i used my interest to persuade him,
when he was [[dead]] and opened, it appeared that he had no malady but in the
kidneys.  they are least excusable for any error in this disease, by
reason that it is in some sort palpable; and ‘tis thence that i conclude
surgery to be much more [[certain]], by [[reason]] that it sees and feels [[feel]] what it
does, and so goes less upon conjecture; whereas the physicians have no
‘speculum matricis’, by which to examine our brains, lungs, and liver.

even the very promises of physic are incredible in themselves; for,
having to provide against divers and contrary accidents that often
afflict us at one and the same [[time]], and that have almost a necessary
relation, as the heat of the liver and the coldness of the stomach, they
will needs persuade us, that of their ingredients one will heat the
stomach and the other will cool the liver: one has its commission to go
directly to the kidneys, nay, even to the bladder, without scattering its
operations by the way, and is to retain its [[power]] and [[virtue]] through all
those turns and meanders, even to the place to the service of which it is
designed, by its own occult [[property]] this will dry-the brain; that will
moisten the lungs.  of all this bundle of things having mixed up a
potion, is it not a [[kind]] of madness to imagine or to [[hope]] that these
differing virtues [[virtue]] should separate themselves from one another in this
mixture and confusion, to perform so many various errands?  i should very
much [[fear]] that they would either lose or [[change]] their tickets, and
disturb one another’s quarters.  and who can imagine but that, in this
liquid confusion, these faculties must [[corrupt]], confound, and spoil one
another?  and is not the danger still more when the making up of this
medicine is entrusted to the [[skill]] and fidelity of still another, to
whose [[mercy]] we again abandon our lives [[life]]?

as we have doublet and breeches-makers, distinct trades [[trade]], to clothe us,
and are so much the [[better]] fitted, seeing that each of them meddles only
with his own [[business]], and has less to trouble his head with than the
tailor who undertakes all; and as in matter of diet, [[great]] persons [[person]], for
their [[better]] convenience, and to the end they may be [[better]] served, have
cooks for the different offices, this for soups and potages, that for
roasting, instead of which if one cook should undertake the whole
service, he could not so well perform it; so also as to the cure of our
maladies.  the [[egyptians]] had [[reason]] to reject this general [[trade]] of
physician, and to divide the profession: to each disease, to each part of
the [[body]], its particular workman; for that part was more properly and
with less confusion cared for, seeing the [[person]] looked to nothing else.
ours are not aware that he who provides for all, provides for nothing;
and that the entire [[government]] of this microcosm is more than they are
able to undertake.  whilst they were afraid of stopping a dysentery, lest
they should put the patient into a fever, they killed me a friend,
--[estienne de la boetie.]--who was worth more than the whole of them.
they counterpoise their own divinations with the [[present]] evils [[evil]]; and
because they will not cure the brain to the prejudice of the stomach,
they injure both with their dissentient and tumultuary drugs.

as to the variety and weakness of the rationale of this art [[arts]], they are
more manifest in it than in any other art [[arts]]; aperitive medicines are proper
for a [[man]] [[subject]] to the stone, by [[reason]] that opening and dilating the
passages they [[help]] forward the slimy matter whereof gravel and stone are
engendered, and convey that downward which begins to harden and gather in
the reins; aperitive things are dangerous for a [[man]] [[subject]] to the stone,
by [[reason]] that, opening and dilating the passages, they [[help]] forward the
matter proper to create the gravel toward the reins, which by their own
propension being apt to seize it, ‘tis not to be imagined but that a
great deal of what has been conveyed thither must remain behind;
moreover, if the medicine happen to meet with anything too large to be
carried through all the narrow passages it must pass to be expelled, that
obstruction, whatever it is, being stirred by these aperitive things and
thrown into those narrow passages, coming to stop them, will [[occasion]] a
certain and most painful [[death]].  they have the like uniformity in the
counsels they give us for the regimen of [[life]]: it is [[good]] to make water
often; for we experimentally see that, in letting it [[lie]] long in the
bladder, we give it [[time]] to settle the sediment, which will concrete into
a stone; it is [[good]] not to make water often, for the heavy excrements it
carries along with it will not be voided without [[violence]], as we see by
experience that a torrent that runs with [[force]] washes the ground it rolls
over much cleaner than the course of a slow and tardy stream; so, it is
good to have often to do with [[women]], for that opens the passages and
helps to evacuate gravel; it is also very ill to have often to do with
women, because it heats, tires, and weakens the reins.  it is [[good]] to
bathe frequently in hot water, forasmuch as that relaxes and mollifies
the places where the gravel and stone [[lie]]; it is also ill by [[reason]] that
this application of external heat helps the reins to bake, harden, and
petrify the matter so disposed.  for those who are taking baths it is
most healthful.  to [[eat]] little at night, to the end that the waters they
are to drink the next morning may have a [[better]] operation upon an empty
stomach; on the other hand, it is [[better]] to [[eat]] little at dinner, that it
hinder not the operation of the waters, while it is not yet [[perfect]], and
not to [[oppress]] the stomach so soon after the other [[labour]], but leave the
office of digestion to the night, which will much [[better]] perform it than
the day, when the [[body]] and [[soul]] are in perpetual moving and action.  thus
do they juggle and trifle in all their discourses at our expense; and
they could not give me one proposition against which i should not know
how to raise a contrary of [[equal]] [[force]].  let them, then, no longer
exclaim against those who in this trouble of sickness suffer themselves
to be gently guided by their own appetite and the [[advice]] of [[nature]], and
commit themselves to the [[common]] [[fortune]].

i have seen in my travels almost all the famous baths of christendom, and
for some years [[past]] have begun to make use of them myself: for i look
upon bathing as generally wholesome, and [[believe]] that we suffer no little
inconveniences in our health by having left off the custom that was
generally observed, in former times [[time]], almost by all nations, and is yet in
many, of bathing every day; and i cannot imagine but that we are much the
worse by, having our limbs crusted and our pores stopped with dirt.  and
as to the drinking of them, [[fortune]] has in the first place rendered them
not at all unacceptable to my taste; and secondly, they are [[natural]] and
simple, which at least carry no danger with them, though they may do us
no [[good]], of which the infinite crowd of [[people]] of all sorts and
complexions who repair thither i take to be a sufficient warranty; and
although i have not there observed any extraordinary and miraculous
effects, but that on the contrary, having more narrowly than ordinary
inquired into it, i have found all the reports of such operations that
have been spread abroad in those places ill-grounded and false, and those
that [[believe]] them (as [[people]] are willing to be gulled in what they
desire) deceived in them, yet i have seldom known any who have been made
worse by those waters, and a [[man]] cannot honestly deny but that they beget
a [[better]] appetite, [[help]] digestion, and do in some sort revive us, if we
do not go too late and in too [[weak]] a condition, which i would dissuade
every one from doing.  they have not the [[virtue]] to raise [[men]] from
desperate and inveterate diseases, but they may [[help]] some light
indisposition, or prevent some threatening alteration.  he who does not
bring along with him so much cheerfulness as to enjoy the [[pleasure]] of the
company he will there meet, and of the walks and exercises to which the
amenity of those places invite us, will doubtless lose the [[best]] and
surest part of their effect.  for this [[reason]] i have hitherto chosen to
go to those of the most pleasant situation, where there was the best
conveniency of lodging, provision, and company, as the baths of bagneres
in [[france]], those of plombieres on the frontiers of germany and lorraine,
those of baden in switzerland, those of lucca in tuscany, and especially
those of della villa, which i have the most and at various seasons
frequented.

every nation has particular opinions [[opinion]] touching their use, and particular
rules and methods in using them; and all of them, according to what i
have seen, almost with like effect.  drinking them is not at all received
in germany; the germans bathe for all diseases, and will [[lie]] dabbling in
the water almost from sun to sun; in [[italy]], where they drink nine days,
they bathe at least thirty, and commonly drink the water mixed with some
other drugs to make it [[work]] the [[better]].  here we are ordered to walk to
digest it; there we are kept in bed after taking it till it be wrought
off, our stomachs and feet having continually hot cloths applied to them
all the while; and as the germans have a particular practice generally to
use cupping and scarification in the bath, so the italians have their
‘doccie’, which are [[certain]] little streams of this hot water brought
through pipes, and with these bathe an hour in the morning, and as much
in the afternoon, for a month together, either the head, stomach, or any
other part where the [[evil]] lies [[lie]].  there are infinite other varieties of
customs in every [[country]], or rather there is no manner of resemblance to
one another.  by this you may see that this little part of physic to
which i have only submitted, though the least depending upon art [[arts]] of all
others, has yet a [[great]] share of the confusion and uncertainty everywhere
else manifest in the profession.

the poets put what they would say with greater emphasis and grace;
witness these two epigrams:

              “alcon hesterno signum jovis attigit: ille,
               quamvis marmoreus, vim patitur medici.
               ecce hodie, jussus transferri ex aeede vetusta,
               effertur, quamvis sit deus atque lapis.”

     [“alcon yesterday touched jove’s statue; he, although marble,
     suffers the [[force]] of the physician: to-day ordered to be transferred
     from the old temple, where it stood, it is carried out, although it
     be a [[god]] and a stone.”--ausonius, ep., 74.]


and the other:

              “lotus nobiscum est, hilaris coenavit; et idem
               inventus mane est mortuus andragoras.
               tam subitae mortis causam, faustine, requiris?
               in somnis medicum viderat hermocratem:”

     [“andragoras bathed with us, supped gaily, and in the morning the
     same was found [[dead]].  dost thou ask, faustinus, the cause of this so
     sudden [[death]]?  in his dreams [[dream]] he had seen the physician hermocrates.”
      --martial, vi. 53.]

upon which i will relate two stories.

the baron de caupene in chalosse and i have betwixt us the advowson of a
benefice of [[great]] extent, at the foot of our mountains, called lahontan.
it is with the inhabitants of this angle, as ‘tis said of those of the
val d’angrougne; they lived a peculiar sort of [[life]], their fashions,
clothes, and manners distinct from other [[people]]; ruled and governed by
certain particular laws [[law]] and usages, received from [[father]] to [[son]], to which
they submitted, without other constraint than the reverence to custom.
this little [[state]] had continued from all antiquity in so [[happy]] a
condition, that no neighbouring [[judge]] was ever put to the trouble of
inquiring into their doings; no advocate was ever retained to give them
counsel, no stranger ever called in to compose their differences; nor was
ever any of them seen to go a-begging.  they avoided all alliances and
traffic with the outer [[world]], that they might not [[corrupt]] the purity of
their own [[government]]; till, as they say, one of them, in the memory of
man, having a [[mind]] spurred on with a [[noble]] [[ambition]], took it into his
head, to bring his name into credit and [[reputation]], to make one of his
sons something more than ordinary, and having put him to learn to write
in a neighbouring town, made him at [[last]] a brave village notary.  this
fellow, having acquired such [[dignity]], began to disdain their ancient
customs, and to buzz into the people’s ears the pomp of the other parts
of the nation; the first prank he played was to advise a friend of his,
whom somebody had offended by sawing off the horns of one of his goats,
to make his complaint to the [[royal]] judges [[judge]] thereabout, and so he went on
from one to another, till he had spoiled and confounded all.  in the tail
of this [[corruption]], they say, there happened another, and of worse
consequence, by means of a physician, who, falling in [[love]] with one of
their daughters [[daughter]], had a [[mind]] to [[marry]] her and to [[live]] amongst them.  this
man first of all began to [[teach]] them the names of fevers, colds, and
imposthumes; the seat of the [[heart]], liver, and intestines, a [[science]] till
then utterly unknown to them; and instead of garlic, with which they were
wont to cure all manner of diseases, how painful or extreme soever, he
taught them, though it were but for a cough or any little cold, to take
strange mixtures, and began to make a [[trade]] not only of their health, but
of their lives [[life]].  they swear till then they never perceived the evening
air to be offensive to the head; that to drink when they were hot was
hurtful, and that the winds of autumn were more unwholesome than those of
spring; that, since this use of physic, they find themselves oppressed
with a legion of unaccustomed diseases, and that they perceive a general
decay in their ancient vigour, and their lives [[life]] are cut shorter by the
half.  this is the first of my stories.

the other is, that before i was afflicted with the stone, hearing that
the [[blood]] of a he-goat was with many in very [[great]] esteem, and looked
upon as a celestial manna rained down upon these latter ages [[age]] for the good
and preservation of the lives [[life]] of [[men]], and having heard it spoken of by
men of understanding for an admirable drug, and of infallible operation;
i, who have ever [[thought]] myself [[subject]] to all the accidents that can
befall other [[men]], had a [[mind]], in my [[perfect]] health, to furnish myself
with this miracle, and therefore gave order to have a goat fed at home
according to the recipe: for he must be taken in the hottest month of all
summer, and must only have aperitive herbs given him to [[eat]], and white
wine to drink.  i came [[home]] by [[chance]] the very day he was to be killed;
and some one came and told me that the cook had found two or three great
balls in his paunch, that rattled against one another amongst what he had
eaten.  i was [[curious]] to have all his entrails brought before me, where,
having caused the skin that enclosed them to be cut, there tumbled out
three [[great]] lumps, as [[light]] as sponges, so that they appeared to be
hollow, but as to the rest, hard and firm without, and spotted and mixed
all over with various [[dead]] colours; one was perfectly round, and of the
bigness of an ordinary ball; the other two something less, of an
imperfect roundness, as seeming not to be arrived at their, full [[growth]].
i find, by inquiry of [[people]] accustomed to open these animals, that it is
a rare and unusual accident.  ‘tis likely these are stones of the same
nature with ours and if so, it must needs be a very [[vain]] [[hope]] in
those who have the stone, to extract their cure from the [[blood]] of a beast
that was himself about to [[die]] of the same disease.  for to say that the
blood does not participate of this contagion, and does not thence alter
its wonted [[virtue]], it is rather to be believed that nothing is engendered
in a [[body]] but by the conspiracy and communication of all the parts: the
whole mass works [[work]] together, though one part contributes more to the work
than another, according to the [[diversity]] of operations; wherefore it is
very likely that there was some petrifying quality in all the parts of
this goat.  it was not so much for [[fear]] of the future, and for myself,
that i was [[curious]] in this experiment, but because it falls out in mine,
as it does in many other families [[family]], that the [[women]] store up such little
trumperies for the service of the [[people]], using the same recipe in fifty
several diseases, and such a recipe as they will not take themselves, and
yet triumph when they happen to be successful.

as to what remains, i [[honour]] physicians, not according to the precept
for their necessity (for to this passage may be opposed another of the
prophet reproving [[king]] asa for having recourse to a physician), but for
themselves, having known many very [[good]] [[men]] of that profession, and most
worthy to be beloved.  i do not attack them; ‘tis their art [[arts]] i inveigh
against, and do not much blame them for making their advantage of our
folly, for most [[men]] do the same.  many callings, both of greater and of
less [[dignity]] than theirs, have no other foundation or support than public
abuse.  when i am sick i send for them if they be near, only to have
their company, and [[pay]] them as others do.  i give them leave to command
me to keep myself warm, because i naturally [[love]] to do it, and to appoint
leeks or lettuce for my broth; to order me [[white]] wine or claret; and so
as to all other things, which are indifferent to my palate and custom.
i [[know]] very well that i do nothing for them in so doing, because
sharpness and strangeness are incidents of the very essence of physic.
lycurgus ordered wine for the sick spartans.  why?  because they
abominated the drinking it when they were well; as a gentleman, a
neighbour of mine, takes it as an excellent medicine in his fever,
because naturally he mortally hates the taste of it.  how many do we see
amongst them of my [[humour]], who despise taking physic themselves, are men
of a liberal diet, and [[live]] a quite contrary sort of [[life]] to what they
prescribe others?  what is this but flatly to [[abuse]] our simplicity?  for
their own lives [[life]] and health are no less dear to them than ours are to us,
and consequently they would accommodate their practice to their rules [[rule]], if
they did not themselves [[know]] how false these are.

‘tis the [[fear]] of [[death]] and of [[pain]], [[impatience]] of disease, and a violent
and indiscreet [[desire]] of a [[present]] cure, that so blind us: ‘tis pure
cowardice that makes our [[belief]] so pliable and easy to be imposed upon:
and yet most [[men]] do not so much [[believe]] as they acquiesce and permit; for
i hear them find [[fault]] and [[complain]] as well as we; but they resolve at
last, “what should i do then?”  as if [[impatience]] were of itself a better
remedy than patience.  is there any one of those who have suffered
themselves to be persuaded into this miserable subjection, who does not
equally [[surrender]] himself to all sorts of impostures?  who does not give
up himself to the [[mercy]] of whoever has the impudence to promise him a
cure?  the babylonians carried their sick into the [[public]] square; the
physician was the [[people]]: every one who passed by being in [[humanity]] and
civility obliged to inquire of their condition, gave some advice
according to his own [[experience]].  we do little [[better]]; there is not so
simple a woman, whose gossips and drenches we do not make use of: and
according to my [[humour]], if i were to take physic, i would sooner choose
to take theirs than any other, because at least, if they do no [[good]], they
will do no harm.  what [[homer]] and [[plato]] said of the [[egyptians]], that they
were all physicians, may be said of all nations; there is not a man
amongst any of them who does not boast of some rare recipe, and who will
not venture it upon his neighbour, if he will let him.  i was the other
day in a company where one, i [[know]] not who, of my fraternity brought us
intelligence of a new sort of pills made up of a hundred and odd
ingredients: it made us very merry, and was a singular consolation, for
what rock could withstand so [[great]] a battery?  and yet i hear from those
who have made [[trial]] of it, that the least atom of gravel deigned not to
stir fort.

i cannot take my hand from the paper before i have added a word
concerning the assurance they give us of the certainty of their drugs,
from the experiments they have made.

the [[greatest]] part, i should say above two-thirds of the medicinal
virtues, consist in the quintessence or occult [[property]] of simples,
of which we can have no other instruction than use and custom; for
quintessence is no other than a quality of which we cannot by our reason
find out the cause.  in such proofs, those they pretend to have acquired
by the inspiration of some daemon, i am content to receive (for i meddle
not with miracles); and also the proofs which are drawn from things that,
upon some other account, often fall into use amongst us; as if in the
wool, wherewith we are wont to clothe ourselves, there has accidentally
some occult desiccative [[property]] been found out of curing kibed heels, or
as if in the radish we [[eat]] for food there has been found out some
aperitive operation.  galen reports, that a [[man]] happened to be cured of a
leprosy by drinking wine out of a vessel into which a viper had crept by
chance.  in this [[example]] we find the means and a very likely guide and
conduct to this [[experience]], as we also do in those that physicians
pretend to have been directed to by the [[example]] of some beasts.  but in
most of their other experiments wherein they affirm they have been
conducted by [[fortune]], and to have had no other guide than [[chance]], i find
the [[progress]] of this information incredible.  suppose [[man]] looking round
about him upon the infinite number of things, plants, animals, metals;
i do not [[know]] where he would begin his [[trial]]; and though his first fancy
should fix him upon an elk’s horn, wherein there must be a very pliant
and easy [[belief]], he will yet find himself as perplexed in his second
operation.  there are so many maladies and so many circumstances
presented to him, that before he can attain the certainty of the point to
which the [[perfection]] of his [[experience]] should arrive, [[human]] sense will be
at the end of its lesson: and before he can, amongst this infinity of
things, find out what this horn is; amongst so many diseases, what is
epilepsy; the many complexions in a melancholy [[person]]; the many seasons
in winter; the many nations in the french; the many ages [[age]] in [[age]]; the many
celestial mutations in the conjunction of [[venus]] and saturn; the many
parts in man’s [[body]], nay, in a finger; and being, in all this, directed
neither by argument, conjecture, [[example]], nor [[divine]] inspirations, but
merely by the sole motion of [[fortune]], it must be by a perfectly
artificial, regular and methodical [[fortune]].  and after the cure is
performed, how can he assure himself that it was not because the disease
had arrived at its period or an effect of [[chance]]?  or the operation of
something else that he had eaten, drunk, or touched that day? or by
virtue of his grandmother’s prayers?  and, moreover, had this experiment
been [[perfect]], how many times [[time]] was it repeated, and this long bead-roll of
haps, and concurrences strung anew by [[chance]] to conclude a [[certain]] [[rule]]?
and when the [[rule]] is concluded, by whom, i [[pray]] you?  of so many
millions, there are but three [[men]] who take upon them to record their
experiments: must [[fortune]] needs just hit one of these?  what if another,
and a hundred others, have made contrary experiments?  we might,
peradventure, have some [[light]] in this, were all the judgments [[judgment]] and
arguments of [[men]] known to us; but that three witnesses, three doctors,
should [[lord]] it over all [[mankind]], is against [[reason]]: it were necessary
that [[human]] [[nature]] should have deputed and chosen them out, and that they
were declared our comptrollers by express procuration:


“to madame de duras.

     --[marguerite de grammont, widow of jean de durfort, seigneur de
     duras, who was killed near leghorn, leaving no [[posterity]].  montaigne
     seems to have been on terms of considerable intimacy with her, and
     to have tendered her some very wholesome and frank [[advice]] in regard
     to her relations with henry iv.]--

“madame,--the [[last]] [[time]] you honoured me with a visit, you found me at work
upon this [[chapter]], and as these trifles may one day fall into your hands,
i would also that they testify in how [[great]] [[honour]] the author will take
any favour you shall please to show them.  you will there find the same
air and mien you have observed in his conversation; and though i could
have borrowed some [[better]] or more favourable garb than my own, i would
not have done it: for i require nothing more of these writings, but to
present me to your memory such as i naturally am.  the same conditions
and faculties you have been pleased to frequent and receive with much
more [[honour]] and courtesy than they deserve, i would put together (but
without alteration or change) in one solid [[body]], that may peradventure
continue some years, or some days, after i am gone; where you may find
them again when you shall please to refresh your memory, without putting
you to any greater trouble; neither are they worth it.  i [[desire]] you
should continue the favour of your [[friendship]] to me, by the same
qualities by which it was acquired.

“i am not at all ambitious that any one should [[love]] and esteem me more
dead than living.  the [[humour]] of tiberius is ridiculous, but yet [[common]],
who was more solicitous to extend his renown to [[posterity]] than to render
himself acceptable to [[men]] of his own [[time]].  if i were one of those to
whom the [[world]] could owe commendation, i would give out of it one-half to
have the other in hand; let their praises [[praise]] come quick and crowding about
me, more thick than long, more full than durable; and let them cease, in
god’s name, with my own [[knowledge]] of them, and when the sweet sound can
no longer pierce my ears.  it were an idle [[humour]] to essay, now that i am
about to forsake the commerce of [[men]], to offer myself to them by a new
recommendation.  i make no account of the goods [[good]] i could not employ in the
service of my [[life]].  such as i am, i will be elsewhere than in paper: my
art and industry have been ever directed to render myself [[good]] for
something; my studies, to [[teach]] me to do, and not to write.  i have made
it my whole [[business]] to frame my [[life]]: this has been my [[trade]] and my
work; i am less a writer of books [[book]] than anything else.  i have coveted
understanding for the service of my [[present]] and real conveniences, and
not to lay up a stock for my [[posterity]].  he who has anything of value in
him, let him make it appear in his conduct, in his ordinary discourses,
in his courtships, and his quarrels: in play, in bed, at table, in the
management of his affairs, in his economics.  those whom i see make good
books in ill breeches, should first have mended their breeches, if they
would have been ruled by me.  ask a spartan whether he had rather be a
good orator or a [[good]] soldier: and if i was [[asked]] the same [[question]], i
would rather choose to be a [[good]] cook, had i not one already to serve me.
my god!  madame, how should i hate such a recommendation of being a
clever fellow at writing, and an ass and an inanity in everything else!
yet i had rather be a [[fool]] both here and there than to have made so ill a
choice wherein to employ my talent.  and i am so far from expecting to
gain any new [[reputation]] by these follies, that i shall [[think]] i come off
pretty well if i lose nothing by them of that little i had before.  for
besides that this [[dead]] and mute painting will take from my [[natural]] being,
it has no resemblance to my [[better]] condition, but is much lapsed from my
former vigour and cheerfulness, growing faded and withered: i am towards
the bottom of the barrel, which begins to taste of the lees.

“as to the rest, madame, i should not have dared to make so bold with the
mysteries of physic, considering the esteem that you and so many others
have of it, had i not had encouragement from their own authors.  i think
there are of these among the old latin writers but two, pliny and celsus
if these ever fall into your hands, you will find that they speak much
more rudely of their art [[arts]] than i do; i but pinch it, they cut its throat.
pliny, amongst other things, twits them with this, that when they are at
the end of their rope, they have a pretty device to save themselves, by
recommending their patients, whom they have teased and tormented with
their drugs and diets to no [[purpose]], some to vows and [[miracles]], others to
the hot baths.  (be not angry, madame; he speaks not of those in our
parts, which are under the protection of your house, and all gramontins.)
they have a third way of saving their own credit, of ridding their hands
of us and securing themselves from the reproaches we might cast in their
teeth of our little amendment, when they have had us so long in their
hands that they have not one more invention left wherewith to amuse us,
which is to send us to the [[better]] air of some other [[country]].  this,
madame, is enough; i [[hope]] you will give me leave to return to my
discourse, from which i have so far digressed, the [[better]] to divert you.”

it was, i [[think]], pericles, who being [[asked]] how he did: “you may [[judge]],”
 says he, “by these,” showing some little scrolls of parchment he had tied
about his neck and arms.  by which he would infer that he must needs be
very sick when he was reduced to a necessity of having recourse to such
idle and [[vain]] fopperies, and of suffering himself to be so equipped.
i dare not promise but that i may one day be so much a [[fool]] as to commit
my [[life]] and [[death]] to the [[mercy]] and [[government]] of physicians; i may fall
into such a frenzy; i dare not be responsible for my future constancy:
but then, if any one ask me how i do, i may also [[answer]], as pericles did,
“you may [[judge]] by this,” shewing my hand clutching six drachms of opium.
it will be a very evident sign of a [[violent]] sickness: my [[judgment]] will be
very much out of order; if once [[fear]] and [[impatience]] get such an advantage
over me, it may very well be concluded that there is a dreadful fever in
my [[mind]].

i have taken the pains [[pain]] to plead this cause, which i understand
indifferently, a little to back and support the [[natural]] aversion to drugs
and the practice of physic i have derived from my [[ancestors]], to the end
it may not be a mere stupid and inconsiderate aversion, but have a little
more form; and also, that they who shall see me so obstinate in my
resolution against all exhortations and menaces that shall be given me,
when my infirmity shall press hardest upon me, may not [[think]] ‘tis mere
obstinacy in me; or any one so ill-natured as to [[judge]] it to be any
motive of [[glory]]: for it would be a [[strange]] [[ambition]] to seek to gain
honour by an action my gardener or my groom can perform as well as i.
certainly, i have not a [[heart]] so tumorous and windy, that i should
exchange so solid a [[pleasure]] as health for an airy and imaginary
pleasure: [[glory]], even that of the four sons [[son]] of aymon, is too dear bought
by a [[man]] of my [[humour]], if it cost him three swinging fits of the stone.
give me health, in [[god’s]] name!  such as [[love]] physic, may also have [[good]],
great, and convincing considerations; i do not hate opinions [[opinion]] contrary to
my own: i am so, far from being angry to see a discrepancy betwixt mine
and other [[men’s]] judgments [[judgment]], and from rendering myself unfit for the
society of [[men]], from being of another sense and party than mine, that on
the contrary (the most general way that [[nature]] has followed being
variety, and more in souls [[soul]] than bodies [[body]], forasmuch as they are of a more
supple substance, and more susceptible of forms) i find it much more rare
to see our humours [[humour]] and designs jump and agree.  and there never were, in
the [[world]], two opinions [[opinion]] alike, no more than two hairs, or two grains:
their most universal quality is [[diversity]].

chapter i

of [[profit]] and honesty

no [[man]] is [[free]] from speaking foolish things; but the worst on’t is, when
a [[man]] labours [[labour]] to play the [[fool]]:

               “nae iste magno conatu magnas nugas dixerit.”

     [“truly he, with a [[great]] effort will shortly say a mighty trifle.”
      ---terence, heaut., act iii., s. 4.]

this does not concern me; mine slip from me with as little [[care]] as they
are of little value, and ‘tis the [[better]] for them.  i would presently
part with them for what they are worth, and neither buy nor sell them,
but as they weigh.  i speak on paper, as i do to the first [[person]] i meet;
and that this is true, observe what follows.

to whom ought not treachery to be hateful, when tiberius refused it in a
thing of so [[great]] importance to him?  he had word sent him from germany
that if he [[thought]] fit, they would rid him of arminius by poison: this
was the most potent [[enemy]] the romans had, who had defeated them so
ignominiously under varus, and who alone prevented their aggrandisement
in those parts.

he returned [[answer]], “that the [[people]] of [[rome]] were wont to revenge
themselves of their enemies [[enemy]] by open ways, and with their swords [[sword]] in their
hands, and not clandestinely and by fraud”: wherein he quitted the
profitable for the honest.  you will tell me that he was a braggadocio; i
believe so too: and ‘tis no [[great]] miracle in [[men]] of his profession.  but
the acknowledgment of [[virtue]] is not less valid in the mouth of him who
hates it, forasmuch as [[truth]] forces [[force]] it from him, and if he will not
inwardly receive it, he at least puts it on for a decoration.

our outward and inward structure is full of imperfection; but there is
nothing useless in [[nature]], not even inutility itself; nothing has
insinuated itself into this [[universe]] that has not therein some fit and
proper place.  our being is cemented with sickly qualities: [[ambition]],
jealousy, envy, [[revenge]], superstition, and despair have so [[natural]] a
possession in us, that its image is discerned in beasts; nay, and
cruelty, so unnatural a [[vice]]; for even in the midst of compassion we feel
within, i [[know]] not what tart-sweet titillation of ill-natured [[pleasure]] in
seeing others suffer; and the [[children]] [[feel]] it:

         “suave mari magno, turbantibus aequora ventis,
          e terra magnum alterius spectare laborem:”

     [“it is sweet, when the winds disturb the waters of the vast sea, to
     witness from [[land]] the peril of other persons [[person]].”--lucretius, ii. i.]

of the seeds of which qualities, whoever should divest [[man]], would destroy
the fundamental conditions of [[human]] [[life]].  likewise, in all governments
there are necessary offices, not only abject, but vicious also.  vices
there [[help]] to make up the seam in our piecing, as poisons are useful for
the conservation of health.  if they become excusable because they are of
use to us, and that the [[common]] necessity covers their true qualities, we
are to resign this part to the strongest and boldest [[citizens]], who
sacrifice their [[honour]] and [[conscience]], as others of old sacrificed their
lives, for the [[good]] of their [[country]]: we, who are weaker, take upon us
parts both that are more easy and less hazardous.  the [[public]] weal
requires that [[men]] should betray, and [[lie]], and massacre; let us leave this
commission to [[men]] who are more [[obedient]] and more supple.

in earnest, i have often been troubled to see judges [[judge]], by fraud and false
hopes of favour or pardon, allure a [[criminal]] to confess his [[fact]], and
therein to make use of cozenage and impudence.  it would become [[justice]],
and [[plato]] himself, who countenances this manner of proceeding, to furnish
me with other means more suitable to my own liking: this is a malicious
kind of [[justice]], and i look upon it as no less wounded by itself than by
others.  i said not long since to some company in discourse, that i
should hardly be drawn to betray my [[prince]] for a particular [[man]], who
should be much ashamed to betray any particular [[man]] for my [[prince]]; and i
do not only hate deceiving myself, but that any one should deceive
through me; i will neither afford matter nor [[occasion]] to any such thing.

in the little i have had to mediate betwixt our princes--[between the
king of navarre, afterwards henry iv., and the duc de guise.  see de
thou, de vita sua, iii. 9.]--in the divisions and subdivisions by which
we are at this [[time]] torn to pieces, i have been very careful that they
should neither be deceived in me nor [[deceive]] others by me.  [[people]] of
that [[kind]] of trading are very reserved, and pretend to be the most
moderate imaginable and nearest to the opinions [[opinion]] of those with whom they
have to do; i expose myself in my stiff [[opinion]], and after a method the
most my own; a tender negotiator, a novice, who had rather fail in the
affair than be wanting to myself.  and yet it has been hitherto with so
good [[luck]] (for [[fortune]] has doubtless the [[best]] share in it), that few
things have passed from hand to hand with less suspicion or more favour
and privacy.  i have a [[free]] and open way that easily insinuates itself
and obtains [[belief]] with those with whom i am to deal at the first
meeting.  sincerity and pure [[truth]], in what [[age]] soever, pass for current;
and besides, the [[liberty]] and [[freedom]] of a [[man]] who treats without any
interest of his own is never hateful or suspected, and he may very well
make use of the [[answer]] of hyperides to the athenians, who complained of
his blunt way of speaking: “messieurs, do not consider whether or no i am
free, but whether i am so without a bribe, or without any advantage to my
own affairs.”  my [[liberty]] of speaking has also easily cleared me from all
suspicion of dissembling by its vehemency, leaving nothing unsaid, how
home and bitter soever (so that i could have said no worse behind their
backs), and in that it carried along with it a manifest show of
simplicity and indifference.  i pretend to no other fruit by acting than
to act, and add to it no long arguments or propositions; every action
plays its own game, [[win]] if it can.

as to the rest, i am not swayed by any passion, either of [[love]] or [[hatred]],
towards the [[great]], nor has my will captivated either by particular injury
or obligation.  i look upon our kings [[king]] with an affection simply [[loyal]] and
respectful, neither prompted nor restrained by any private interest, and
i [[love]] myself for it.  nor does the general and just cause attract me
otherwise than with moderation, and without heat.  i am not [[subject]] to
those penetrating and close compacts and engagements.  anger and hatred
are beyond the [[duty]] of [[justice]]; and are [[passions]] only useful to those who
do not keep themselves strictly to their [[duty]] by simple [[reason]]:

          “utatur motu animi, qui uti ratione non potest.”

     [“he may employ his passion, who can make no use of his [[reason]].”
      --cicero, tusc. quaes., iv. 25.]

all legitimate intentions are temperate and equable of themselves; if
otherwise, they degenerate into seditious and unlawful.  this is it which
makes me walk everywhere with my head erect, my face and my [[heart]] open.
in [[truth]], and i am not afraid to confess it, i should easily, in case of
need, hold up one candle to st. michael and another to his dragon, like
the old woman; i will [[follow]] the [[right]] side even to the [[fire]], but
exclusively, if i can.  let montaigne be overwhelmed in the [[public]] ruin
if need be; but if there be no need, i should [[think]] myself obliged to
fortune to save me, and i will make use of all the length of line my duty
allows for his preservation.  was it not atticus who, being of the just
but losing side, preserved himself by his moderation in that universal
shipwreck of the [[world]], amongst so many mutations and diversities?  for
private [[man]], as he was, it is more easy; and in such [[kind]] of [[work]], i
think a [[man]] may justly not be ambitious to offer and insinuate himself.
for a [[man]], indeed, to be wavering and irresolute, to keep his affection
unmoved and without inclination in the troubles of his [[country]] and public
divisions, i neither [[think]] it handsome nor honest:

          “ea non media, sed nulla via est, velut eventum
          exspectantium, quo fortunae consilia sua applicent.”

     [“that is not a middle way, but no way, to await events, by which
     they refer their resolutions to [[fortune]].”--livy, xxxii. 21.]

this may be allowed in our neighbours’ affairs; and thus gelo, the tyrant
of syracuse, suspended his inclination in the [[war]] betwixt the greeks [[greek]] and
barbarians, keeping a resident ambassador with presents [[present]] at delphos, to
watch and see which way [[fortune]] would incline, and then take fit occasion
to fall in with the victors.  it would be a [[kind]] of [[treason]] to proceed
after this manner in our own domestic affairs, wherein a [[man]] must of
necessity be of the one side or the other; though for a [[man]] who has no
office or express command to call him out, to sit still i hold it more
excusable (and yet i do not excuse myself upon these terms) than in
foreign expeditions, to which, however, according to our laws [[law]], no [[man]] is
pressed against his will.  and yet even those who wholly engage
themselves in such a [[war]] may behave themselves with such temper and
moderation, that the storm may fly over their heads without doing them
any harm.  had we not [[reason]] to [[hope]] such an issue in the [[person]] of the
late bishop of orleans, the sieur de morvilliers?

     [an able negotiator, who, though protected by the guises, and
     strongly supporting them, was yet very far from persecuting the
     reformists.  he died 1577.]

and i [[know]], amongst those who behave themselves most bravely in the
present [[war]], some whose manners are so gentle, obliging, and just, that
they will certainly stand firm, whatever event [[heaven]] is preparing for
us.  i am of [[opinion]] that it properly belongs to kings [[king]] only to quarrel
with kings [[king]]; and i laugh at those spirits who, out of lightness of [[heart]],
lend themselves to so disproportioned disputes; for a [[man]] has never the
more particular quarrel with a [[prince]], by marching openly and boldly
against him for his own [[honour]] and according to his [[duty]]; if he does not
love such a [[person]], he does [[better]], he esteems him.  and notably the
cause of the laws [[law]] and of the ancient [[government]] of a [[kingdom]], has this
always annexed to it, that even those who, for their own private
interest, invade them, excuse, if they do not [[honour]], the defenders.

but we are not, as we nowadays do, to call peevishness and inward
discontent, that spring from private interest and passion, [[duty]], nor a
treacherous and malicious conduct, [[courage]]; they call their proneness to
mischief and [[violence]] zeal; ‘tis not the cause, but their interest, that
inflames them; they kindle and begin a [[war]], not because it is just, but
because it is [[war]].

a [[man]] may very well behave himself commodiously and loyally too amongst
those of the adverse party; carry yourself, if not with the same equal
affection (for that is capable of different measure), at least with an
affection moderate, well tempered, and such as shall not so engage you to
one party, that it may demand all you are able to do for that side,
content yourself with a moderate proportion of their, favour and
goodwill; and to swim in troubled waters without fishing in them.

the other way, of offering a man’s [[self]] and the utmost service he is able
to do, both to one party and the other, has still less of prudence in it
than [[conscience]].  does not he to whom you betray another, to whom you
were as welcome as to himself, [[know]] that you will at another [[time]] do as
much for him?  he holds you for a villain; and in the meantime hears what
you will say, gathers [[intelligence]] from you, and works [[work]] his own ends out
of your disloyalty; double-dealing [[men]] are useful for bringing in, but we
must have a [[care]] they carry out as little as is possible.

i say nothing to one party that i may not, upon [[occasion]], say to the
other, with a little alteration of accent; and report nothing but things
either indifferent or known, or what is of [[common]] consequence.  i cannot
permit myself, for any consideration, to tell them a [[lie]].  what is
intrusted to my secrecy, i religiously conceal; but i take as few trusts
of that [[nature]] upon me as i can.  the secrets of princes [[prince]] are a
troublesome burthen to such as are not interested in them.  i very
willingly bargain that they trust me with little, but confidently rely
upon what i tell them.  i have ever known more than i [[desired]].  one open
way of speaking introduces another open way of speaking, and draws out
discoveries, like wine and [[love]].  philippides, in my [[opinion]], answered
king lysimachus very discreetly, who, asking him what of his estate he
should bestow upon him?  “what you will,” said he, “provided it be none
of your secrets.”  i see every one is displeased if the bottom of the
affair be concealed from him wherein he is employed, or that there be any
reservation in the thing; for my part, i am content to [[know]] no more of
the [[business]] than what they would have me employ myself in, nor desire
that my [[knowledge]] should exceed or restrict what i have to say.  if i
must serve for an instrument of deceit, let it be at least with a safe
conscience: i will not be reputed a servant either so affectionate or so
loyal as to be fit to betray any one: he who is unfaithful to himself, is
excusably so to his master.  but they are princes [[prince]] who do not accept men
by halves, and despise limited and conditional services: i cannot help
it: i frankly tell them how far i can go; for a [[slave]] i should not be,
but to [[reason]], and i can hardly submit even to that.  and they also are
to blame to exact from a freeman the same subjection and obligation to
their service that they do from him they have made and bought, or whose
fortune particularly and expressly depends upon theirs.  the laws [[law]] have
delivered me from a [[great]] [[anxiety]]; they have chosen a side for me, and
given me a master; all other superiority and obligation ought to be
relative to that, and cut, off from all other.  yet this is not to say,
that if my affection should otherwise incline me, my hand should
presently obey it; the will and [[desire]] are a [[law]] to themselves; but
actions must receive commission from the [[public]] appointment.

all this proceeding of mine is a little dissonant from the ordinary
forms; it would [[produce]] no [[great]] effects, nor be of any long duration;
innocence itself could not, in this [[age]] of ours, either negotiate without
dissimulation, or traffic without lying; and, indeed, [[public]] employments
are by no means for my palate: what my profession requires, i perform
after the most private manner that i can.  being [[young]], i was engaged up
to the ears in [[business]], and it succeeded well; but i disengaged myself
in [[good]] [[time]].  i have often since avoided meddling in it, rarely
accepted, and never [[asked]] it; keeping my back still turned to [[ambition]];
but if not like rowers who so advance backward, yet so, at the same [[time]],
that i am less obliged to my resolution than to my [[good]] [[fortune]], that i
was not wholly embarked in it.  for there are ways less displeasing to my
taste, and more suitable to my ability, by which, if she had formerly
called me to the [[public]] service, and my own advancement towards the
world’s [[opinion]], i [[know]] i should, in spite of all my own arguments to the
contrary, have pursued them.  such as commonly say, in opposition to what
i profess, that what i call [[freedom]], simplicity, and plainness in my
manners, is art [[arts]] and subtlety, and rather prudence than goodness, industry
than [[nature]], [[good]] sense than [[good]] [[luck]], do me more [[honour]] than disgrace:
but, certainly, they make my subtlety too subtle; and whoever has
followed me close, and pryed narrowly into me, i will give him the
victory, if he does not confess that there is no [[rule]] in their school
that could match this [[natural]] motion, and maintain an appearance of
liberty and licence, so [[equal]] and inflexible, through so many various and
crooked paths, and that all their wit and endeavour could never have led
them through.  the way of [[truth]] is one and simple; that of particular
profit, and the commodity of affairs a [[man]] is entrusted with, is double,
unequal, and casual.  i have often seen these counterfeit and artificial
liberties practised, but, for the most part, without [[success]]; they relish
of aesop’s ass who, in emulation of the dog, obligingly clapped his two
fore-feet upon his master’s shoulders; but as many caresses as the dog
had for such an expression of [[kindness]], twice so many blows with a cudgel
had the [[poor]] ass for his compliment:

     “id maxime quemque decet, quod est cujusque suum maxime.”

     [“that [[best]] becomes every [[man]] which belongs most to him;”
      --cicero, de offic., i. 31.]

i will not deprive deceit of its due; that were but ill to [[understand]] the
world: i [[know]] it has often been of [[great]] use, and that it maintains and
supplies most [[men’s]] employment.  there are vices [[vice]] that are lawful, as
there are many actions, either [[good]] or excusable, that are not lawful in
themselves.

the [[justice]] which in itself is [[natural]] and universal is otherwise and
more nobly ordered than that other [[justice]] which is special, national,
and constrained to the ends of [[government]],

          “veri juris germanaeque justitiae solidam et expressam
          effigiem nullam tenemus; umbra et imaginibus utimur;”

     [“we retain no solid and express portraiture of true [[right]] and
     germane [[justice]]; we have only the shadow and image of it.”
      --cicero, de offic., iii. 17.]

insomuch that the sage dandamis, hearing the lives [[life]] of [[socrates]],
pythagoras, and diogenes [[read]], judged them to be [[great]] [[men]] every way,
excepting that they were too much subjected to the reverence of the laws [[law]],
which, to second and authorise, true [[virtue]] must abate very much of its
original vigour; many vicious actions are introduced, not only by their
permission, but by their [[advice]]:

     “ex senatus consultis plebisquescitis scelera exercentur.”

     [“crimes are committed by the decrees of the senate and the
     popular assembly.”--seneca, ep., 95.]

i [[follow]] the [[common]] phrase that distinguishes betwixt profitable and
honest things, so as to call some [[natural]] actions, that are not only
profitable but necessary, dishonest and foul.

but let us proceed in our examples [[example]] of treachery two pretenders to the
kingdom of thrace--[rhescuporis and cotys. tacitus, annal., ii.  65]--
were fallen into dispute about their title; the [[emperor]] hindered them
from proceeding to blows: but one of them, under colour of bringing
things to a friendly issue by an interview, having invited his competitor
to an entertainment in his own house, imprisoned and killed him.  justice
required that the romans should have satisfaction for this offence; but
there was a difficulty in obtaining it by ordinary ways; what, therefore,
they could not do legitimately, without [[war]] and without danger, they
resolved to do by treachery; and what they could not honestly do, they
did profitably.  for which end, one pomponius flaccus was found to be a
fit instrument.  this [[man]], by dissembled words and assurances, having
drawn the other into his toils, instead of the [[honour]] and favour he had
promised him, sent him bound hand and foot to [[rome]].  here one traitor
betrayed another, contrary to [[common]] custom: for they are full of
mistrust, and ‘tis hard to overreach them in their own art [[arts]]: witness the
sad [[experience]] we have lately had.--[montaigne here probably refers to
the feigned reconciliation between catherine de medici and henri, duc de
guise, in 1588.]

let who will be pomponius flaccus, and there are enough who would: for my
part, both my word and my [[faith]] are, like all the rest, parts of this
common [[body]]: their [[best]] effect is the [[public]] service; this i take for
presupposed.  but should one command me to take charge of the courts of
law and lawsuits, i should make [[answer]], that i understood it not; or the
place of a leader of pioneers, i would say, that i was called to a more
honourable employment; so likewise, he that would employ me to [[lie]],
betray, and forswear myself, though not to assassinate or to poison, for
some notable service, i should say, “if i have robbed or stolen anything
from any [[man]], send me rather to the galleys.”  for it is permissible in a
man of [[honour]] to say, as the lacedaemonians did,--[plutarch, difference
between a flatterer and a friend, c. 21.]--having been defeated by
antipater, when just upon concluding an agreement: “you may impose as
heavy and ruinous taxes upon us as you please, but to command us to do
shameful and dishonest things, you will lose your [[time]], for it is to no
purpose.”  every one ought to make the same vow to himself that the kings
of [[egypt]] made their judges [[judge]] solemnly swear, that they would not do
anything contrary to their consciences, though never so much commanded to
it by themselves.  in such commissions there is evident mark of ignominy
and condemnation; and he who gives it at the same [[time]] accuses you, and
gives it, if you [[understand]] it [[right]], for a burden and a [[punishment]].
as much as the [[public]] affairs are bettered by your exploit, so much are
your own the worse, and the [[better]] you behave yourself in it, ‘tis so
much the worse for yourself; and it will be no new thing, nor,
peradventure, without some colour of [[justice]], if the same [[person]] ruin
you who set you on [[work]].

if treachery can be in any case excusable, it must be only so when it is
practised to chastise and betray treachery.  there are examples [[example]] enough of
treacheries, not only rejected, but chastised and punished by those in
favour of whom they were undertaken.  who is ignorant of fabricius
sentence against the physician of pyrrhus?

but this we also find recorded, that some persons [[person]] have commanded a thing,
who afterward have severely avenged the execution of it upon him they had
employed, rejecting the [[reputation]] of so unbridled an [[authority]], and
disowning so abandoned and base a servitude and [[obedience]].  jaropelk,
duke of russia, tampered with a gentleman of hungary to betray boleslaus,
king of poland, either by killing him, or by giving the russians
opportunity to do him some notable mischief.  this worthy went ably to
work: he was more assiduous than before in the service of that [[king]], so
that he obtained the [[honour]] to be of his council, and one of the chiefest
in his trust.  with these advantages, and taking an opportune [[occasion]] of
his master’s absence, he betrayed vislicza, a [[great]] and [[rich]] [[city]], to the
russians, which was entirely sacked and burned, and not only all the
inhabitants of both sexes [[sex]], [[young]] and old, put to the [[sword]], but moreover
a [[great]] number of neighbouring gentry, whom he had drawn thither to that
end.  jaropelk, his [[revenge]] being thus satisfied and his anger appeased,
which was not, indeed, without pretence (for boleslaus had highly
offended him, and after the same manner), and sated with the fruit of
this treachery, coming to consider the fulness of it, with a sound
judgment and clear from passion, looked upon what had been done with so
much [[horror]] and remorse that he caused the [[eyes]] to be bored out and the
tongue and shameful parts to be cut off of him who had performed it.

antigonus persuaded the argyraspides to betray eumenes, their general,
his adversary, into his hands; but after he had caused him, so delivered,
to be slain, he would himself be the commissioner of the [[divine]] justice
for the [[punishment]] of so detestable a crime, and committed them into the
hands of the governor of the province, with express command, by whatever
means, to [[destroy]] and bring them all to an [[evil]] end, so that of that
great number of [[men]], not so much as one ever returned again into
macedonia: the [[better]] he had been served, the more wickedly he judged it
to be, and meriting greater [[punishment]].

the [[slave]] who betrayed the place where his master, p. sulpicius, lay
concealed, was, according to the promise of sylla’s proscription,
manumitted for his pains [[pain]]; but according to the promise of the public
justice, which was [[free]] from any such engagement, he was thrown headlong
from the tarpeian rock.

our [[king]] clovis, instead of the arms of gold he had promised them, caused
three of cararie’s servants to be [[hanged]] after they had betrayed their
master to him, though he had debauched them to it: he [[hanged]] them with
the purse of their [[reward]] about their necks; after having satisfied his
second and special [[faith]], he satisfied the general and first.

mohammed ii.  having resolved to rid himself of his [[brother]], out of
jealousy of [[state]], according to the practice of the ottoman [[family]], he
employed one of his officers in the execution, who, pouring a quantity of
water too fast into him, choked him.  this being done, to expiate the
murder, he delivered the murderer into the hands of the [[mother]] of him he
had so caused to be put to [[death]], for they were only brothers [[brother]] by the
father’s side; she, in his presence, ripped up the murderer’s bosom, and
with her own hands rifled his breast for his [[heart]], tore it out, and
threw it to the dogs.  and even to the worst [[people]] it is the sweetest
thing imaginable, having once gained their end by a vicious action, to
foist, in all security, into it some show of [[virtue]] and [[justice]], as by
way of compensation and conscientious correction; to which may be added,
that they look upon the ministers of such horrid crimes as upon [[men]] who
reproach them with them, and [[think]] by their deaths [[death]] to erase the memory
and testimony of such proceedings.

or if, perhaps, you are rewarded, not to frustrate the [[public]] necessity
for that extreme and desperate remedy, he who does it cannot for all
that, if he be not such himself, but look upon you as an accursed and
execrable fellow, and conclude you a greater traitor than he does,
against whom you are so: for he tries the malignity of your disposition
by your own hands, where he cannot possibly be deceived, you having no
object of preceding [[hatred]] to move you to such an act; but he employs you
as they do condemned malefactors in executions of [[justice]], an office as
necessary as dishonourable.  besides the baseness of such commissions,
there is, moreover, a prostitution of [[conscience]].  seeing that the
daughter of sejanus could not be put to [[death]] by the [[law]] of [[rome]], because
she was a virgin, she was, to make it lawful, first ravished by the
hangman and then strangled: not only his hand but his [[soul]] is [[slave]] to
the [[public]] convenience.

when amurath i., more grievously to punish his subjects [[subject]] who had taken
part in the parricide rebellion of his [[son]], ordained that their nearest
kindred should assist in the execution, i find it very handsome in some
of them to have rather chosen to be unjustly [[thought]] guilty of the
parricide of another than to serve [[justice]] by a parricide of their own.
and where i have seen, at the taking of some little fort by assault in my
time, some rascals who, to save their own lives [[life]], would [[consent]] to hang
their [[friends]] and companions, i have looked upon them to be of worse
condition than those who were [[hanged]].  ‘tis said, that witold, [[prince]] of
lithuania, introduced into the nation the practice that the criminal
condemned to [[death]] should with his own hand execute the sentence,
thinking it [[strange]] that a third [[person]], [[innocent]] of the [[fault]], should be
made guilty of homicide.

a [[prince]], when by some urgent circumstance or some impetuous and
unforeseen accident that very much concerns his [[state]], compelled to
forfeit his word and break his [[faith]], or otherwise forced from his
ordinary [[duty]], ought to attribute this necessity to a lash of the divine
rod: [[vice]] it is not, for he has given up his own [[reason]] to a more
universal and more powerful [[reason]]; but certainly ‘tis a misfortune: so
that if any one should ask me what remedy?  “none,” say i, “if he were
really racked between these two extremes: ‘sed videat, ne quoeratur
latebya perjurio’, he must do it: but if he did it without regret, if it
did not weigh on him to do it, ‘tis a sign his [[conscience]] is in a sorry
condition.”  if there be a [[person]] to be found of so tender a conscience
as to [[think]] no cure whatever worth so important a remedy, i shall like
him never the worse; he could not more excusably or more decently perish.
we cannot do all we would, so that we must often, as the [[last]] anchorage,
commit the protection of our vessels to the simple conduct of [[heaven]].
to what more just necessity does he reserve himself?  what is less
possible for him to do than what he cannot do but at the expense of his
faith and [[honour]], things that, perhaps, ought to be dearer to him than
his own safety, or even the safety of his [[people]].  though he should, with
folded arms, only call [[god]] to his assistance, has he not [[reason]] to hope
that the [[divine]] goodness will not refuse the favour of an extraordinary
arm to just and pure hands?  these are dangerous examples [[example]], rare and
sickly exceptions to our [[natural]] rules [[rule]]: we must yield to them, but with
great moderation and circumspection: no private utility is of such
importance that we should upon that account strain our consciences to
such a [[degree]]: the [[public]] may be, when very manifest and of very great
concern.

timoleon made a timely expiation for his [[strange]] exploit by the tears he
shed, calling to [[mind]] that it was with a fraternal hand that he had slain
the [[tyrant]]; and it justly pricked his [[conscience]] that he had been
necessitated to purchase the [[public]] utility at so [[great]] a price as the
violation of his private morality.  even the senate itself, by his means
delivered from [[slavery]], durst not positively determine of so high a [[fact]],
and divided into two so important and contrary aspects; but the
syracusans,  sending at the same [[time]] to the corinthians to solicit their
protection, and to require of them a captain fit to re-establish their
city in its former [[dignity]] and to clear sicily of several little tyrants
by whom it was [[oppressed]], they deputed timoleon for that service, with
this cunning declaration; “that according as he should behave himself
well or ill in his employment, their sentence should incline either to
favour the deliverer of his [[country]], or to disfavour the murderer of his
brother.”  this fantastic conclusion carries along with it some excuse,
by [[reason]] of the danger of the [[example]], and the importance of so strange
an action: and they did well to discharge their own [[judgment]] of it, and
to refer it to others who were not so much concerned.  but timoleon’s
comportment in this expedition soon made his cause more clear, so
worthily and virtuously he demeaned himself upon all occasions [[occasion]]; and the
good [[fortune]] that accompanied him in the difficulties he had to overcome
in this [[noble]] employment, seemed to be strewed in his way by the gods,
favourably conspiring for his justification.

the end of this matter is excusable, if any can be so; but the [[profit]] of
the augmentation of the [[public]] [[revenue]], that served the roman senate for
a pretence to the foul conclusion i am going to relate, is not sufficient
to warrant any such [[injustice]].

certain cities [[city]] had redeemed themselves and their [[liberty]] by [[money]], by the
order and [[consent]] of the senate, out of the hands of l. sylla: the
business coming again in [[question]], the senate condemned them to be
taxable as they were before, and that the [[money]] they had disbursed for
their redemption should be lost to them.  civil [[war]] often produces [[produce]] such
villainous examples [[example]]; that we punish private [[men]] for confiding in us when
we were [[public]] ministers: and the self-same magistrate makes another man
pay the penalty of his [[change]] that has nothing to do with it; the
pedagogue whips his scholar for his docility; and the guide beats the
blind [[man]] whom he leads by the hand; a horrid image of [[justice]].

there are rules [[rule]] in [[philosophy]] that are both false and [[weak]].  the example
that is proposed to us for preferring private utility before [[faith]] given,
has not weight enough by the circumstances they put to it; robbers have
seized you, and after having made you swear to [[pay]] them a [[certain]] sum of
money, dismiss you.  ‘tis not well done to say, that an honest [[man]] can be
quit of his oath without payment, being out of their hands.  ‘tis no such
thing: what [[fear]] has once made me willing to do, i am obliged to do it
when i am no longer in [[fear]]; and though that [[fear]] only prevailed with my
tongue without forcing my will, yet am i bound to keep my word.  for my
part, when my tongue has sometimes inconsiderately said something that i
did not [[think]], i have made a [[conscience]] of disowning it: otherwise, by
degrees, we shall abolish all the [[right]] another derives from our promises
and oaths:

               “quasi vero forti viro vis possit adhiberi.”

          [“as though a [[man]] of true [[courage]] could be compelled.”
           --cicero, de offic., iii. 30.]

and ‘tis only lawful, upon the account of private interest, to excuse
breach of promise, when we have promised something that is unlawful and
wicked in itself; for the [[right]] of [[virtue]] ought to take place of the
right of any obligation of ours.

i have formerly placed epaminondas in the first rank of excellent [[men]],
and do not repent it.  how high did he stretch the consideration of his
own particular [[duty]]? he who never killed a [[man]] whom he had overcome; who,
for the inestimable benefit of restoring the [[liberty]] of his [[country]], made
conscience of killing a [[tyrant]] or his accomplices without due form of
justice: and who concluded him to be a wicked [[man]], how [[good]] a citizen
soever otherwise, who amongst his enemies [[enemy]] in [[battle]] spared not his friend
and his guest.  this was a [[soul]] of a [[rich]] composition: he married
goodness and [[humanity]], nay, even the tenderest and most delicate in the
whole school of [[philosophy]], to the roughest and most [[violent]] human
actions.  was it [[nature]] or art [[arts]] that had intenerated that [[great]] [[courage]] of
his, so full, so obstinate against [[pain]] and [[death]] and [[poverty]], to such an
extreme [[degree]] of sweetness and compassion?  dreadful in arms and [[blood]],
he overran and subdued a nation invincible by all others but by him
alone; and yet in the heat of an encounter, could turn aside from his
friend and guest.  certainly he was fit to command in [[war]] who could so
rein himself with the curb of [[good]] [[nature]], in the height and heat of his
fury, a fury inflamed and foaming with [[blood]] and slaughter.  ‘tis a
miracle to be able to mix any image of [[justice]] with such [[violent]] actions:
and it was only possible for such a steadfastness of [[mind]] as that of
epaminondas therein to mix sweetness and the facility of the gentlest
manners and purest innocence.  and whereas one told the mamertini that
statutes were of no efficacy against armed [[men]]; and another told the
tribune of the [[people]] that the [[time]] of [[justice]] and of [[war]] were distinct
things; and a third said that the noise of arms deafened the voice of
laws, this [[man]] was not precluded from listening to the laws [[law]] of civility
and pure courtesy.  had he not borrowed from his enemies [[enemy]] the custom of
sacrificing to the muses when he went to [[war]], that they might by their
sweetness and gaiety soften his martial and rigorous fury?  let us not
fear, by the [[example]] of so [[great]] a master, to [[believe]] that there is
something unlawful, even against an [[enemy]], and that the [[common]] concern
ought not to require all things of all [[men]], against private interest:

          “manente memoria, etiam in dissidio publicorum
          foederum, privati juris:”

          [“the memory of private [[right]] remaining even amid
          [[public]] dissensions.”--livy, xxv. 18.]

              “et nulla potentia vires
               praestandi, ne quid peccet amicus, habet;”

     [“no [[power]] on [[earth]] can sanction treachery against a friend.”
      --ovid, de ponto, i. 7, 37.]

and that all things are not lawful to an honest [[man]] for the service of
his [[prince]], the laws [[law]], or the general quarrel:

          “non enim patria praestat omnibus officiis....
          et ipsi conducit pios habere cives in parentes.”

     [“the [[duty]] to one’s [[country]] does not supersede all other duties [[duty]].
     the [[country]] itself requires that its [[citizens]] should act piously
     toward their parents.”--cicero, de offic., iii. 23.]

tis an instruction proper for the [[time]] wherein we [[live]]: we need not
harden our [[courage]] with these arms of steel; ‘tis enough that our
shoulders are inured to them: ‘tis enough to dip our pens in ink without
dipping them in [[blood]].  if it be grandeur of [[courage]], and the effect of a
rare and singular [[virtue]], to contemn [[friendship]], private obligations, a
man’s word and relationship, for the [[common]] [[good]] and [[obedience]] to the
magistrate, ‘tis certainly sufficient to excuse us, that ‘tis a grandeur
that can have no place in the grandeur of epaminondas’ [[courage]].

i abominate those mad exhortations of this other discomposed [[soul]],

              “dum tela micant, non vos pietatis imago
               ulla, nec adversa conspecti fronte parentes
               commoveant; vultus gladio turbate verendos.”

     [“while swords [[sword]] glitter, let no [[idea]] of piety, nor the face even of a
     [[father]] presented to you, move you: mutilate with your [[sword]] those
     venerable features “--lucan, vii. 320.]

let us deprive wicked, bloody, and [[treacherous]] natures [[nature]] of such a pretence
of [[reason]]: let us set aside this guilty and extravagant [[justice]], and
stick to more [[human]] imitations.  how [[great]] things can [[time]] and example
do!  in an encounter of the civil [[war]] against cinna, one of pompey’s
soldiers having unawares killed his [[brother]], who was of the contrary
party, he immediately for shame and [[sorrow]] killed himself: and some years
after, in another civil [[war]] of the same [[people]], a soldier demanded a
reward of his officer for having killed his [[brother]].

a [[man]] but ill proves the [[honour]] and [[beauty]] of an action by its utility:
and very erroneously concludes that every one is obliged to it, and that
it becomes every one to do it, if it be of utility:

               “omnia non pariter rerum sunt omnibus apta.”


               [“all things are not equally fit for all [[men]].”
                --propertius, iii. 9, 7.]

let us take that which is most necessary and profitable for human
society; it will be [[marriage]]; and yet the council of the saints find the
contrary much [[better]], excluding from it the most venerable vocation of
man: as we design those horses for stallions of which we have the least
esteem.




chapter ii

of repentance

others form [[man]]; i only report him: and represent a particular one, ill
fashioned enough, and whom, if i had to model him anew, i should
certainly make something else than what he is but that’s [[past]] recalling.
now, though the features of my picture alter and [[change]], ‘tis not,
however, unlike: the [[world]] eternally turns round; all things therein are
incessantly moving, the [[earth]], the rocks of caucasus, and the pyramids of
egypt, both by the [[public]] motion and their own.  even constancy itself is
no other but a slower and more languishing motion.  i cannot fix my
object; ‘tis always tottering and reeling by a [[natural]] giddiness; i take
it as it is at the instant i consider it; i do not paint its being, i
paint its passage; not a passing from one [[age]] to another, or, as the
people say, from seven to seven years, but from day to day, from minute
to minute, i must accommodate my [[history]] to the hour: i may presently
change, not only by [[fortune]], but also by intention.  ‘tis a counterpart
of various and changeable accidents, and of irresolute imaginations [[imagination]], and,
as it falls out, sometimes contrary: whether it be that i am then another
self, or that i take subjects [[subject]] by other circumstances and considerations:
so it is that i may peradventure contradict myself, but, as demades said,
i never contradict the [[truth]].  could my [[soul]] once take footing, i would
not essay but resolve: but it is always learning and making [[trial]].

i propose a [[life]] ordinary and without lustre: ‘tis all one; all moral
philosophy may as well be applied to a [[common]] and private [[life]], as to one
of richer composition: every [[man]] carries the entire form of human
condition.  authors communicate themselves to the [[people]] by some especial
and extrinsic mark; i, the first of any, by my universal being; as michel
de montaigne, not as a grammarian, a poet, or a lawyer.  if the world
find [[fault]] that i speak too much of myself, i find [[fault]] that they do not
so much as [[think]] of themselves.  but is it [[reason]] that, being so
particular in my way of living, i should pretend to recommend myself to
the [[public]] [[knowledge]]?  and is it also [[reason]] that i should [[produce]] to the
world, where art [[arts]] and handling have so much credit and [[authority]], crude
and simple effects of [[nature]], and of a [[weak]] [[nature]] to boot?  is it not to
build a wall without stone or brick, or some such thing, to write books
without learning and without art [[arts]]?  the fancies of [[music]] are carried on by
art; mine by [[chance]].  i have this, at least, according to discipline,
that never any [[man]] treated of a [[subject]] he [[better]] understood and knew
than i what i have undertaken, and that in this i am the most
understanding [[man]] alive: secondly, that never any [[man]] penetrated farther
into his matter, nor [[better]] and more distinctly sifted the parts and
sequences of it, nor ever more exactly and fully arrived at the end he
proposed to himself.  to [[perfect]] it, i need bring nothing but fidelity to
the [[work]]; and that is there, and the most pure and sincere that is
anywhere to be found.  i speak [[truth]], not so much as i would, but as much
as i dare; and i dare a little the more, as i grow older; for, methinks,
custom allows to [[age]] more [[liberty]] of prating, and more indiscretion of
talking of a man’s [[self]].  that cannot fall out here, which i often see
elsewhere, that the [[work]] and the artificer contradict one another:
“can a [[man]] of such sober conversation have written so foolish a [[book]]?”
 or “do so learned writings proceed from a [[man]] of so [[weak]] conversation?”
 he who talks at a very ordinary rate, and writes rare matter, ‘tis to say
that his capacity is borrowed and not his own.  a learned [[man]] is not
learned in all things: but a sufficient [[man]] is sufficient throughout,
even to ignorance itself; here my [[book]] and i go hand in hand together.
elsewhere [[men]] may commend or censure the [[work]], without reference to the
workman; here they cannot: who touches the one, touches the other.  he
who shall [[judge]] of it without knowing him, will more [[wrong]] himself than
me; he who does [[know]] him, gives me all the satisfaction i [[desire]].  i
shall be [[happy]] beyond my desert, if i can obtain only thus much from the
public approbation, as to make [[men]] of understanding perceive that i was
capable of profiting by [[knowledge]], had i had it; and that i deserved to
have been assisted by a [[better]] memory.

be pleased here to excuse what i often repeat, that i very rarely repent,
and that my [[conscience]] is satisfied with itself, not as the [[conscience]] of
an angel, or that of a horse, but as the [[conscience]] of a [[man]]; always
adding this clause, not one of [[ceremony]], but a true and real submission,
that i speak inquiring and doubting, purely and simply referring myself
to the [[common]] and accepted beliefs for the resolution.  i do not [[teach]]; i
only relate.

there is no [[vice]] that is absolutely a [[vice]] which does not offend, and
that a sound [[judgment]] does not accuse; for there is in it so manifest a
deformity and inconvenience, that peradventure they are in the [[right]] who
say that it is chiefly begotten by stupidity and ignorance: so hard is it
to imagine that a [[man]] can [[know]] without abhorring it.  malice sucks up the
greatest part of its own venom, and poisons itself.  [[vice]] leaves
repentance in the [[soul]], like an ulcer in the flesh, which is always
scratching and lacerating itself: for [[reason]] effaces all other [[grief]] and
sorrows, but it begets that of repentance, which is so much the more
grievous, by [[reason]] it springs within, as the cold and heat of fevers are
more sharp than those that only strike upon the outward skin.  i hold for
vices (but every one according to its proportion), not only those which
reason and [[nature]] condemn, but those also which the [[opinion]] of [[men]],
though false and erroneous, have made such, if authorised by [[law]] and
custom.

there is likewise no [[virtue]] which does not rejoice a well-descended
nature: there is a [[kind]] of, i [[know]] not what, congratulation in well-doing
that gives us an inward satisfaction, and a generous boldness that
accompanies a [[good]] [[conscience]]: a [[soul]] daringly vicious may, peradventure,
arm itself with security, but it cannot supply itself with this
complacency and satisfaction.  ‘tis no little satisfaction to [[feel]] a
man’s [[self]] preserved from the contagion of so depraved an [[age]], and to say
to himself: “whoever could penetrate into my [[soul]] would not there find me
guilty either of the affliction or ruin of any one, or of [[revenge]] or
envy, or any offence against the [[public]] laws [[law]], or of innovation or
disturbance, or failure of my word; and though the licence of the time
permits and teaches [[teach]] every one so to do, yet have i not plundered any
frenchman’s goods [[good]], or taken his [[money]], and have lived upon what is my
own, in [[war]] as well as in [[peace]]; neither have i set any [[man]] to work
without paying him his hire.”  these testimonies of a [[good]] conscience
please, and this [[natural]] rejoicing is very beneficial to us, and the only
reward that we can never fail of.

to ground the recompense of [[virtuous]] actions upon the approbation of
others is too uncertain and unsafe a foundation, especially in so corrupt
and ignorant an [[age]] as this, wherein the [[good]] [[opinion]] of the vulgar is
injurious: upon whom do you rely to show you what is recommendable?  god
defend me from being an honest [[man]], according to the descriptions of
honour i daily see every one make of himself:

               “quae fuerant vitia, mores sunt.”

     [“what before had been vices [[vice]] are now manners.”--seneca, ep., 39.]

some of my [[friends]] have at times [[time]] schooled and scolded me with great
sincerity and plainness, either of their own voluntary motion, or by me
entreated to it as to an office, which to a well-composed [[soul]] surpasses
not only in utility, but in [[kindness]], all other offices of [[friendship]]: i
have always received them with the most open arms, both of courtesy and
acknowledgment; but to say the [[truth]], i have often found so much false
measure, both in their reproaches and praises [[praise]], that i had not done much
amiss, rather to have done ill, than to have done well according to their
notions.  we, who [[live]] private lives [[life]], not exposed to any other view than
our own, ought chiefly to have settled a pattern within ourselves by
which to try our actions: and according to that, sometimes to encourage
and sometimes to [[correct]] ourselves.  i have my laws [[law]] and my judicature to
judge of myself, and apply myself more to these than to any other rules [[rule]]:
i do, indeed, restrain my actions according to others; but extend them
not by any other [[rule]] than my own.  you yourself only [[know]] if you are
cowardly and cruel, [[loyal]] and devout: others see you not, and only guess
at you by uncertain conjectures, and do not so much see your [[nature]] as
your art [[arts]]; rely not therefore upon their opinions [[opinion]], but stick to your own:

     “tuo tibi judicio est utendum.... virtutis et vitiorum grave ipsius
     conscientiae pondus est: qua sublata, jacent omnia.”

     [“thou must employ thy own [[judgment]] upon thyself; [[great]] is the
     weight of thy own [[conscience]] in the discovery of virtues [[virtue]] and vices [[vice]]:
     which taken away, all things are lost.”
      --cicero, de nat. dei, iii.  35; tusc. quaes., i. 25.]

but the saying that repentance immediately follows the [[sin]] seems not to
have [[respect]] to [[sin]] in its high estate, which is lodged in us as in its
own proper habitation.  one may disown and retract the vices [[vice]] that
surprise us, and to which we are hurried by [[passions]]; but those which by
a long habit are rooted in a [[strong]] and vigorous will are not [[subject]] to
contradiction.  repentance is no other but a recanting of the will and an
opposition to our fancies, which lead us which way they please.  it makes
this [[person]] disown his former [[virtue]] and continency:

         “quae mens [[men]] est hodie, cur eadem non puero fait?
          vel cur his animis incolumes non redeunt genae?”

     [“what my [[mind]] is, why was it not the same, when i was a boy?  or
     why do not the cheeks return to these feelings?”
      --horace, od., v. 10, 7.]

‘tis an exact [[life]] that maintains itself in due order in private.  every
one may juggle his part, and represent an honest [[man]] upon the stage: but
within, and in his own bosom, where all may do as they list, where all is
concealed, to be regular, there’s the point.  the next [[degree]] is to be so
in his house, and in his ordinary actions, for which we are accountable
to none, and where there is no study nor artifice.  and therefore bias,
setting forth the excellent [[state]] of a private [[family]], says: “of which a
the master is the same within, by his own [[virtue]] and temper, that he is
abroad, for [[fear]] of the laws [[law]] and report of [[men]].”  and it was a worthy
saying of julius drusus, to the masons who offered him, for three
thousand crowns [[crown]], to put his house in such a posture that his neighbours
should no longer have the same inspection into it as before; “i will give
you,” said he, “six thousand to make it so that everybody may see into
every room.”  ‘tis honourably recorded of agesilaus, that he used in his
journeys always to take up his lodgings in temples, to the end that the
people and the gods themselves might pry into his most private actions.
such a one has been a miracle to the [[world]], in whom neither his [[wife]] nor
servant has ever seen anything so much as remarkable; few [[men]] have been
admired by their own domestics; no one was ever a [[prophet]], not merely in
his own house, but in his own [[country]], says the [[experience]] of histories [[history]]:
--[no [[man]] is a hero to his valet-de-chambre, said marshal catinat]--‘tis
the same in things of nought, and in this low [[example]] the image of a
greater is to be seen.  in my [[country]] of gascony, they look upon it as a
drollery to see me in print; the further off i am [[read]] from my own [[home]],
the [[better]] i am esteemed.  i purchase printers in guienne; elsewhere they
purchase me.  upon this it is that they lay their foundation who conceal
themselves [[present]] and living, to obtain a name when they are [[dead]] and
absent.  i had rather have a [[great]] deal less in hand, and do not expose
myself to the [[world]] upon any other account than my [[present]] share; when i
leave it i quit the rest.  see this functionary whom the [[people]] escort in
state, with wonder and applause, to his very door; he puts off the
pageant with his robe, and falls so much the lower by how much he was
higher exalted: in himself within, all is tumult and degraded.  and
though all should be regular there, it will require a vivid and
well-chosen [[judgment]] to perceive it in these low and private actions; to
which may be added, that order is a dull, sombre [[virtue]].  to enter a
breach, conduct an embassy, govern a [[people]], are actions of renown; to
reprehend, laugh, sell, [[pay]], [[love]], hate, and gently and justly converse
with a man’s own [[family]] and with himself; not to relax, not to give a
man’s [[self]] the [[lie]], is more rare and hard, and less remarkable.  by which
means, retired lives [[life]], whatever is said to the contrary, undergo duties [[duty]] of
as [[great]] or greater difficulty than the others do; and private [[men]], says
aristotle,’ serve [[virtue]] more painfully and highly than those in
authority do: we prepare ourselves for eminent occasions [[occasion]], more out of
glory than [[conscience]].  the shortest way to arrive at [[glory]], would be to
do that for [[conscience]] which we do for [[glory]]: and the [[virtue]] of alexander
appears to me of much less vigour in his [[great]] theatre, than that of
socrates in his mean and obscure employment.  i can easily conceive
socrates in the place of alexander, but alexander in that of [[socrates]], i
cannot.  who shall ask the one what he can do, he will [[answer]], “subdue
the world”: and who shall put the same [[question]] to the other, he will
say, “carry on [[human]] [[life]] conformably with its [[natural]] condition”; a much
more general, weighty, and legitimate [[science]] than the other.--[montaigne
added here, “to do for the [[world]] that for which he came into the [[world]],”
 but he afterwards erased these words from the manuscript.--naigeon.]

the [[virtue]] of the [[soul]] does not consist in flying high, but in walking
orderly; its grandeur does not exercise itself in grandeur, but in
mediocrity.  as they who [[judge]] and try us within, make no [[great]] account
of the lustre of our [[public]] actions, and see they are only streaks and
rays of clear water springing from a slimy and muddy bottom so, likewise,
they who [[judge]] of us by this gallant outward appearance, in like manner
conclude of our internal [[constitution]]; and cannot couple common
faculties, and like their own, with the other faculties that astonish
them, and are so far out of their sight.  therefore it is that we give
such savage forms to demons: and who does not give tamerlane great
eyebrows, wide nostrils, a dreadful visage, and a prodigious stature,
according to the [[imagination]] he has conceived by the report of his name?
had any one formerly brought me to erasmus, i should hardly have believed
but that all was adage and apothegm he spoke to his [[man]] or his hostess.
we much more aptly imagine an artisan upon his close-stool, or upon his
wife, than a [[great]] president venerable by his port and sufficiency: we
fancy that they, from their high tribunals, will not abase themselves so
much as to [[live]].  as vicious souls [[soul]] are often incited by some foreign
impulse to do well, so are [[virtuous]] souls [[soul]] to do ill; they are therefore
to be judged by their settled [[state]], when they are at [[home]], whenever that
may be; and, at all events, when they are nearer repose, and in their
native station.

natural inclinations are much assisted and fortified by [[education]]; but
they seldom alter and overcome their institution: a thousand natures [[nature]] of
my [[time]] have escaped towards [[virtue]] or [[vice]], through a quite contrary
discipline:

              “sic ubi, desuetae silvis, in carcere clausae
               mansuevere ferx, et vultus posuere minaces,
               atque hominem didicere pati, si torrida parvus
               venit in ora cruor, redeunt rabiesque fororque,
               admonitaeque tument gustato sanguine fauces
               fervet, et a trepido vix abstinet ira magistro;”

     [“so savage beasts, when shut up in cages and grown unaccustomed to
     the woods, have become tame, and have laid aside their fierce looks,
     and submit to the [[rule]] of [[man]]; if again a slight taste of blood
     comes into their mouths, their rage and fury return, their jaws are
     erected by thirst of [[blood]], and their anger scarcely abstains from
     their trembling masters.”--lucan, iv. 237.]

these original qualities are not to be rooted out; they may be covered
and concealed.  the latin tongue is as it were [[natural]] to me; i
understand it [[better]] than french; but i have not been used to speak it,
nor hardly to write it, these forty years.  unless upon extreme and
sudden emotions which i have fallen into twice or thrice in my [[life]], and
once seeing my [[father]] in [[perfect]] health fall upon me in a swoon, i have
always uttered from the bottom of my [[heart]] my first words in latin;
nature deafened, and forcibly expressing itself, in spite of so long a
discontinuation; and this [[example]] is said of many others.

they who in my [[time]] have attempted to [[correct]] the manners of the [[world]] by
new opinions [[opinion]], reform seeming vices [[vice]]; but the essential vices [[vice]] they leave as
they were, if indeed they do not augment them, and augmentation is
therein to be feared; we defer all other well doing upon the account of
these external reformations, of less cost and greater show, and thereby
expiate [[good]] cheap, for the other [[natural]], consubstantial, and intestine
vices.  look a little into our [[experience]]: there is no [[man]], if he listen
to himself, who does not in himself discover a particular and governing
form of his own, that jostles his [[education]], and wrestles with the
tempest of [[passions]] that are contrary to it.  for my part, i seldom find
myself agitated with surprises; i always find myself in my place, as
heavy and unwieldy bodies [[body]] do; if i am not at [[home]], i am always near at
hand; my dissipations do not transport me very far; there is nothing
strange or extreme in the case; and yet i have sound and vigorous turns.

the true condemnation, and which touches the [[common]] practice of [[men]], is
that their very retirement itself is full of filth and [[corruption]]; the
idea of their reformation composed, their repentance sick and faulty,
very nearly as much as their [[sin]].  some, either from having been linked
to [[vice]] by a [[natural]] propension or long practice, cannot see its
deformity.  others (of which [[constitution]] i am) do indeed [[feel]] the weight
of [[vice]], but they counterbalance it with [[pleasure]], or some other
occasion; and suffer and lend themselves to it for a [[certain]] price, but
viciously and basely.  yet there might, haply, be imagined so vast a
disproportion of measure, where with [[justice]] the [[pleasure]] might excuse
the [[sin]], as we say of utility; not only if accidental and out of [[sin]], as
in thefts, but in the very exercise of [[sin]], or in the enjoyment of [[women]],
where the temptation is [[violent]], and, ‘tis said, sometimes not to be
overcome.

being the other day at armaignac, on the estate of a kinsman of mine, i
there saw a peasant who was by every one nicknamed the thief.  he thus
related the story of his [[life]]: that, being born a beggar, and finding
that he should not be able, so as to be clear of indigence, to get his
living by the sweat of his brow, he resolved to turn thief, and by means
of his [[strength]] of [[body]] had exercised this [[trade]] all the [[time]] of his
youth in [[great]] security; for he ever made his harvest and vintage in
other [[men’s]] grounds, but a [[great]] way off, and in so [[great]] quantities,
that it was not to be imagined one [[man]] could have carried away so much in
one night upon his shoulders; and, moreover, he was careful equally to
divide and distribute the mischief he did, that the loss was of less
importance to every particular [[man]].  he is now grown old, and [[rich]] for a
man of his condition, thanks to his [[trade]], which he openly confesses to
every one.  and to make his [[peace]] with [[god]], he says, that he is daily
ready by [[good]] offices to make satisfaction to the successors of those he
has robbed, and if he do not finish (for to do it all at once he is not
able), he will then leave it in charge to his heirs to perform the rest,
proportionably to the [[wrong]] he himself only knows [[know]] he has done to each.
by this description, true or false, this [[man]] looks upon theft as a
dishonest action, and hates it, but less than [[poverty]], and simply
repents; but to the extent he has thus recompensed he repents not.  this
is not that habit which incorporates us into [[vice]], and conforms even our
understanding itself to it; nor is it that impetuous whirlwind that by
gusts troubles and blinds our souls [[soul]], and for the [[time]] precipitates us,
judgment and all, into the [[power]] of [[vice]].

i customarily do what i do thoroughly and make but one step on’t; i have
rarely any movement that hides itself and steals away from my [[reason]], and
that does not proceed in the matter by the [[consent]] of all my faculties,
without division or intestine sedition; my [[judgment]] is to have all the
blame or all the [[praise]]; and the blame it once has, it has always; for
almost from my infancy it has ever been one: the same inclination, the
same turn, the same [[force]]; and as to universal opinions [[opinion]], i fixed myself
from my [[childhood]] in the place where i resolved to stick.  there are some
sins that are impetuous, prompt, and sudden; let us set them aside: but
in these other sins [[sin]] so often repeated, deliberated, and contrived,
whether sins [[sin]] of [[complexion]] or sins [[sin]] of profession and vocation, i cannot
conceive that they should have so long been settled in the same
resolution, unless the [[reason]] and [[conscience]] of him who has them, be
constant to have them; and the repentance he boasts to be inspired with
on a sudden, is very hard for me to imagine or form.  i [[follow]] not the
opinion of the pythagorean sect, “that [[men]] take up a new [[soul]] when they
repair to the images of the gods to receive their oracles,” unless he
mean that it must needs be extrinsic, new, and lent for the [[time]]; our own
showing so little sign of purification and cleanness, fit for such an
office.

they act quite contrary to the stoical precepts, who do indeed command us
to [[correct]] the imperfections and vices [[vice]] we [[know]] ourselves guilty of, but
forbid us therefore to disturb the repose of our souls [[soul]]: these make us
believe that they have [[great]] [[grief]] and remorse within: but of amendment,
correction, or interruption, they make nothing appear.  it cannot be a
cure if the malady be not wholly discharged; if repentance were laid upon
the scale of the balance, it would weigh down [[sin]].  i find no quality so
easy to counterfeit as devotion, if [[men]] do not conform their manners and
life to the profession; its essence is abstruse and occult; the
appearance easy and ostentatious.

for my own part, i may [[desire]] in general to be other than i am; i may
condemn and dislike my whole form, and beg of almighty [[god]] for an entire
reformation, and that he will please to pardon my [[natural]] infirmity: but
i ought not to call this repentance, methinks, no more than the being
dissatisfied that i am not an angel or cato.  my actions are regular,
and conformable to what i am and to my condition; i can do no [[better]];
and repentance does not properly touch things that are not in our [[power]];
sorrow does..  i imagine an infinite number of natures [[nature]] more elevated and
regular than mine; and yet i do not for all that improve my faculties, no
more than my arm or will grow more [[strong]] and vigorous for conceiving
those of another to be so.  if to conceive and [[wish]] a nobler way of
acting than that we have should [[produce]] a repentance of our own, we must
then repent us of our most [[innocent]] actions, forasmuch as we may well
suppose that in a more excellent [[nature]] they would have been carried on
with greater [[dignity]] and [[perfection]]; and we would that ours were so.
when i reflect upon the deportment of my [[youth]], with that of my old [[age]],
i find that i have commonly behaved myself with [[equal]] order in both
according to what i [[understand]]: this is all that my [[resistance]] can do.
i do not flatter myself; in the same circumstances i should do the same
things.  it is not a patch, but rather an universal tincture, with which
i am stained.  i [[know]] no repentance, superficial, half-way, and
ceremonious; it must sting me all over before i can call it so, and must
prick my bowels as deeply and universally as [[god]] sees into me.

as to [[business]], many excellent opportunities have escaped me for want of
good management; and yet my deliberations were sound enough, according to
the occurrences presented to me: ‘tis their way to choose always the
easiest and safest course.  i find that, in my former resolves, i have
proceeded with discretion, according to my own [[rule]], and according to the
state of the [[subject]] proposed, and should do the same a thousand years
hence in like occasions [[occasion]]; i do not consider what it is now, but what it
was then, when i deliberated on it: the [[force]] of all counsel consists in
the [[time]]; occasions [[occasion]] and things eternally shift and [[change]].  i have in my
life committed some important errors, not for want of [[good]] understanding,
but for want of [[good]] [[luck]].  there are secret, and not to be foreseen,
parts in matters we have in hand, especially in the [[nature]] of [[men]]; mute
conditions, that make no show, unknown sometimes even to the possessors
themselves, that spring and start up by incidental occasions [[occasion]]; if my
prudence could not penetrate into nor foresee them, i blame it not: ‘tis
commissioned no further than its own limits; if the event be too hard for
me, and take the side i have refused, there is no remedy; i do not blame
myself, i accuse my [[fortune]], and not my [[work]]; this cannot be called
repentance.

phocion, having given the athenians an [[advice]] that was not followed, and
the affair nevertheless succeeding contrary to his [[opinion]], some one said
to him, “well, phocion, art [[arts]] thou content that matters go so well?”--“i am
very well content,” replied he, “that this has happened so well, but i do
not repent that i counselled the other.”  when any of my [[friends]] address
themselves to me for [[advice]], i give it candidly and clearly, without
sticking, as almost all other [[men]] do, at the hazard of the thing’s
falling out contrary to my [[opinion]], and that i may be reproached for my
counsel; i am very indifferent as to that, for the [[fault]] will be theirs
for having consulted me, and i could not refuse them that office.
--[we may give [[advice]] to others, says rochefoucauld, but we cannot
supply them with the wit to [[profit]] by it.]

i, for my own part, can rarely blame any one but myself for my oversights
and misfortunes, for indeed i seldom solicit the [[advice]] of another,
if not by [[honour]] of [[ceremony]], or excepting where i stand in need of
information, special [[science]], or as to matter of [[fact]].  but in things
wherein i stand in need of nothing but [[judgment]], other [[men’s]] reasons [[reason]] may
serve to fortify my own, but have little [[power]] to dissuade me; i hear
them all with civility and patience; but, to my recollection, i never
made use of any but my own.  with me, they are but flies and atoms, that
confound and distract my will; i lay no [[great]] stress upon my opinions [[opinion]];
but i lay as little upon those of others, and [[fortune]] rewards [[reward]] me
accordingly: if i receive but little [[advice]], i also give but little.  i
am seldom consulted, and still more seldom believed, and [[know]] no concern,
either [[public]] or private, that has been mended or bettered by my [[advice]].
even they whom [[fortune]] had in some sort tied to my direction, have more
willingly [[suffered]] themselves to be governed by any other counsels than
mine.  and as a [[man]] who am as [[jealous]] of my repose as of my [[authority]],
i am [[better]] pleased that it should be so; in leaving me there, they
humour what i profess, which is to settle and wholly contain myself
within myself.  i take a [[pleasure]] in being uninterested in other men’s
affairs, and disengaged from being their warranty, and responsible for
what they do.

in all affairs that are [[past]], be it how it will, i have very little
regret; for this [[imagination]] puts me out of my [[pain]], that they were so to
fall out they are in the [[great]] [[revolution]] of the [[world]], and in the chain
of stoical ‘causes: your fancy cannot, by [[wish]] and [[imagination]], move one
tittle, but that the [[great]] current of things will not reverse both the
past and the future.

as to the rest, i abominate that incidental repentance which old age
brings along with it.  he, who said of old, that he was obliged to his
age for having weaned him from [[pleasure]], was of another [[opinion]] than i
am; i can never [[think]] myself beholden to impotency for any [[good]] it can do
to me:

     “nec tam aversa unquam videbitur ab opere suo providentia,
     ut debilitas inter optima inventa sit.”

     [“nor can providence ever seem so averse to her own [[work]], that
     debility should be found to be amongst the [[best]] things.”
      --quintilian, instit.  orat., v. 12.]

our appetites are rare in old [[age]]; a profound satiety seizes us after the
act; in this i see nothing of [[conscience]]; chagrin and weakness imprint in
us a drowsy and rheumatic [[virtue]].  we must not suffer ourselves to be so
wholly carried away by [[natural]] alterations as to suffer our judgments [[judgment]] to
be imposed upon by them.  [[youth]] and [[pleasure]] have not formerly so far
prevailed with me, that i did not well enough discern the face of [[vice]] in
pleasure; neither does the distaste that years have brought me, so far
prevail with me now, that i cannot discern [[pleasure]] in [[vice]].  now that i
am no more in my flourishing [[age]], i [[judge]] as well of these things as if i
were.

          [“old though i am, for ladies’ [[love]] unfit,
          the [[power]] of [[beauty]] i [[remember]] yet.”--chaucer.]

i, who narrowly and strictly examine it, find my [[reason]] the very same it
was in my most licentious [[age]], except, perhaps, that ‘tis weaker and more
decayed by being grown older; and i find that the [[pleasure]] it refuses me
upon the account of my bodily health, it would no more refuse now, in
consideration of the health of my [[soul]], than at any [[time]] heretofore.
i do not repute it the more valiant for not being able to combat; my
temptations are so broken and mortified, that they are not worth its
opposition; holding but out my hands, i repel them.  should one present
the old concupiscence before it, i [[fear]] it would have less [[power]] to
resist it than heretofore; i do not discern that in itself it judges
anything otherwise now than it formerly did, nor that it has acquired any
new [[light]]: wherefore, if there be convalescence, ‘tis an enchanted one.
miserable [[kind]] of remedy, to owe one’s health to one’s disease!  tis not
that our misfortune should perform this office, but the [[good]] [[fortune]] of
our [[judgment]].  i am not to be made to do anything by persecutions and
afflictions, but to curse them: that is, for [[people]] who cannot be roused
but by a whip.  my [[reason]] is much more [[free]] in [[prosperity]], and much more
distracted, and put to’t to digest pains [[pain]] than pleasures [[pleasure]]: i see [[best]] in a
clear [[sky]]; health admonishes me more cheerfully, and to [[better]] [[purpose]],
than sickness.  i did all that in me lay to reform and regulate myself
from pleasures [[pleasure]], at a [[time]] when i had health and vigour to enjoy them;
i should be ashamed and envious that the misery and misfortune of my old
age should have credit over my [[good]] healthful, sprightly, and vigorous
years, and that [[men]] should estimate me, not by what i have been, but by
what i have ceased to be.

in my [[opinion]], ‘tis the [[happy]] living, and not (as antisthenes’ said) the
happy dying, in which [[human]] felicity consists.  i have not made it my
business to make a monstrous addition of a philosopher’s tail to the head
and [[body]] of a libertine; nor would i have this wretched remainder give
the [[lie]] to the pleasant, sound, and long part of my [[life]]: i would present
myself uniformly throughout.  were i to [[live]] my [[life]] over again, i should
live it just as i have lived it; i neither [[complain]] of the [[past]], nor do i
fear the future; and if i am not much deceived, i am the same within that
i am without.  ‘tis one main obligation i have to my [[fortune]], that the
succession of my bodily estate has been carried on according to the
natural seasons; i have seen the grass, the blossom, and the fruit, and
now see the withering; happily, however, because naturally.  i bear the
infirmities i have the [[better]], because they came not till i had [[reason]] to
expect them, and because also they make me with greater [[pleasure]] remember
that long felicity of my [[past]] [[life]].  my [[wisdom]] may have been just the
same in both ages [[age]], but it was more active, and of [[better]] grace whilst
young and sprightly, than now it is when broken, peevish, and uneasy.
i repudiate, then, these casual and painful reformations.  [[god]] must touch
our hearts [[heart]]; our consciences must amend of themselves, by the aid of our
reason, and not by the decay of our appetites; [[pleasure]] is, in itself,
neither pale nor discoloured, to be discerned by dim and decayed [[eyes]].

we ought to [[love]] temperance for itself, and because [[god]] has commanded
that and chastity; but that which we are reduced to by catarrhs, and for
which i am indebted to the stone, is neither chastity nor temperance; a
man cannot boast that he despises and resists [[pleasure]] if he cannot see
it, if he knows [[know]] not what it is, and cannot discern its graces, its [[force]],
and most alluring beauties [[beauty]]; i [[know]] both the one and the other, and may
therefore the [[better]] say it.  but; methinks, our souls [[soul]] in old [[age]] are
subject to more troublesome maladies and imperfections than in [[youth]];
i said the same when [[young]] and when i was reproached with the want of a
beard; and i say so now that my grey hairs give me some [[authority]].  we
call the difficulty of our humours [[humour]] and the disrelish of [[present]] things
wisdom; but, in [[truth]], we do not so much forsake vices [[vice]] as we [[change]] them,
and in my [[opinion]], for worse.  besides a foolish and feeble [[pride]], an
impertinent prating, froward and insociable humours [[humour]], superstition, and a
ridiculous [[desire]] of riches [[rich]] when we have lost the use of them, i find
there more envy, [[injustice]], and malice.  [[age]] imprints more wrinkles in
the [[mind]] than it does on the face; and souls [[soul]] are never, or very rarely
seen, that, in growing old, do not smell sour and musty.  [[man]] moves all
together, both towards his [[perfection]] and decay.  in observing the wisdom
of [[socrates]], and many circumstances of his condemnation, i should dare to
believe that he in some sort himself purposely, by collusion, contributed
to it, seeing that, at the [[age]] of seventy years, he might [[fear]] to suffer
the lofty motions of his [[mind]] to be cramped and his wonted lustre
obscured.  what [[strange]] metamorphoses do i see [[age]] every day make in many
of my acquaintance!  ‘tis a potent malady, and that naturally and
imperceptibly steals into us; a vast provision of study and great
precaution are required to evade the imperfections it loads us with, or
at least to weaken their [[progress]].  i find that, notwithstanding all my
entrenchments, it gets foot by foot upon me: i make the [[best]] [[resistance]] i
can, but i do not [[know]] to what at [[last]] it will reduce me.  but fall out
what will, i am content the [[world]] may [[know]], when i am fallen, from what i
fell.




chapter iii

of three commerces

we must not rivet ourselves so fast to our humours [[humour]] and complexions: our
chiefest sufficiency is to [[know]] how to apply ourselves to divers
employments.  ‘tis to be, but not to [[live]], to keep a man’s [[self]] tied and
bound by necessity to one only course; those are the bravest souls [[soul]] that
have in them the most variety and pliancy.  of this here is an honourable
testimony of the elder cato:

          “huic versatile ingenium sic pariter ad omnia fuit,
          ut natum ad id unum diceres, quodcumque ageret.”

     [“his parts were so pliable to all uses, that one would say he had
     been born only to that which he was doing.”--livy, xxxix. 49.]

had i [[liberty]] to set myself forth after my own mode, there is no so
graceful [[fashion]] to which i would be so fixed as not to be able to
disengage myself from it; [[life]] is an unequal, irregular and multiform
motion.  ‘tis not to be a friend to one’s [[self]], much less a master ‘tis
to be a [[slave]], incessantly to be [[led]] by the nose by one’s [[self]], and to be
so fixed in one’s previous inclinations, that one cannot turn aside nor
writhe one’s neck out of the collar.  i say this now in this part of my
life, wherein i find i cannot easily disengage myself from the
importunity of my [[soul]], which cannot ordinarily amuse itself but in
things of limited range, nor employ itself otherwise than entirely and
with all its [[force]]; upon the lightest [[subject]] offered it expands and
stretches it to that [[degree]] as therein to employ its utmost [[power]];
wherefore it is that idleness is to me a very painful [[labour]], and very
prejudicial to my health.  most [[men’s]] minds [[mind]] require [[foreign]] matter to
exercise and enliven them; mine has rather need of it to sit still and
repose itself,

               “vitia otii negotio discutienda sunt,”

          [“the vices [[vice]] of sloth are to be shaken off by [[business]].”
           --seneca, ep. 56.]

for its chiefest and hardest study is to study itself.  books [[book]] are to it
a sort of employment that debauch it from its study.  upon the first
thoughts that possess it, it begins to bustle and make [[trial]] of its
vigour in all directions, exercises its [[power]] of handling, now making
trial of [[force]], now fortifying, moderating, and ranging itself by the way
of grace and order.  it has of its own wherewith to rouse its faculties:
nature has given to it, as to all others, matter enough of its own to
make advantage of, and subjects [[subject]] proper enough where it may either invent
or [[judge]].

meditation is a powerful and full study to such as can effectually taste
and employ themselves; i had rather [[fashion]] my [[soul]] than furnish it.
there is no employment, either more [[weak]] or more [[strong]], than that of
entertaining a man’s own thoughts [[thought]], according as the [[soul]] is; the greatest
men make it their whole [[business]],

                    “quibus vivere est cogitare;”

     [“to whom to [[live]] is to [[think]].”--cicero, tusc. quaes., v. 28.]

nature has therefore favoured it with this [[privilege]], that there is
nothing we can do so long, nor any action to which we more frequently and
with greater facility addict ourselves.  ‘tis the [[business]] of the gods,
says [[aristotle]],’ and from which both their beatitude and ours proceed.

the principal use of reading to me is, that by various objects it rouses
my [[reason]], and employs my [[judgment]], not my memory.  few conversations
detain me without [[force]] and effort; it is true that [[beauty]] and elegance
of [[speech]] take as much or more with me than the weight and depth of the
subject; and forasmuch as i am apt to be sleepy in all other
communication, and give but the rind of my attention, it often falls out
that in such [[poor]] and pitiful discourses, mere chatter, i either make
drowsy, unmeaning answers [[answer]], unbecoming a child, and ridiculous, or more
foolishly and rudely still, maintain an obstinate [[silence]].  i have a
pensive way that withdraws me into myself, and, with that, a heavy and
childish ignorance of many very ordinary things, by which two qualities i
have earned this, that [[men]] may truly relate five or six as ridiculous
tales of me as of any other [[man]] whatever.

but, to proceed in my [[subject]], this difficult [[complexion]] of mine renders
me very nice in my conversation with [[men]], whom i must cull and pick out
for my [[purpose]]; and unfits me for [[common]] [[society]].  we [[live]] and negotiate
with the [[people]]; if their conversation be troublesome to us, if we
disdain to apply ourselves to mean and vulgar souls [[soul]] (and the mean and
vulgar are often as regular as those of the finest thread, and all wisdom
is folly that does not accommodate itself to the [[common]] ignorance),
we must no more intermeddle either with other [[men’s]] affairs or our own;
for [[business]], both [[public]] and private, has to do with these [[people]].  the
least forced and most [[natural]] motions of the [[soul]] are the most beautiful;
the [[best]] employments, those that are least strained.  my god!  how good
an office does [[wisdom]] to those whose desires [[desire]] it limits to their power!
that is the most useful [[knowledge]]: “according to what a [[man]] can,” was the
favourite sentence and motto of [[socrates]].  a motto of [[great]] solidity.

we must moderate and adapt our desires [[desire]] to the nearest and easiest to be
acquired things.  is it not a foolish [[humour]] of mine to separate myself
from a thousand to whom my [[fortune]] has conjoined me, and without whom i
cannot [[live]], and cleave to one or two who are out of my intercourse; or
rather a fantastic [[desire]] of a thing i cannot obtain?  my gentle and easy
manners, enemies [[enemy]] of all sourness and harshness, may easily enough have
secured me from envy and animosities; to be beloved, i do not say, but
never any [[man]] gave less [[occasion]] of being hated; but the coldness of my
conversation has, reasonably enough, deprived me of the goodwill of many,
who are to be excused if they interpret it in another and worse sense.

i am very capable of contracting and maintaining rare and exquisite
friendships; for by [[reason]] that i so greedily seize upon such
acquaintance as fit my liking, i throw myself with such [[violence]] upon
them that i hardly fail to stick, and to make an impression where i hit;
as i have often made [[happy]] proof.  in ordinary friendships [[friendship]] i am somewhat
cold and shy, for my motion is not [[natural]], if not with full sail:
besides which, my [[fortune]] having in my [[youth]] given me a relish for one
sole and [[perfect]] [[friendship]], has, in [[truth]], created in me a [[kind]] of
distaste to others, and too much imprinted in my fancy that it is a beast
of company, as the ancient said, but not of the herd.--[plutarch, on the
plurality of [[friends]], c.  2.]--and also i have a [[natural]] difficulty of
communicating myself by halves, with the modifications and the servile
and [[jealous]] prudence required in the conversation of numerous and
imperfect friendships [[friendship]]: and we are principally enjoined to these in this
age of ours, when we cannot talk of the [[world]] but either with danger or
falsehood.

yet do i very well discern that he who has the conveniences (i mean the
essential conveniences) of [[life]] for his end, as i have, ought to fly
these difficulties and delicacy of [[humour]], as much as the plague.  i
should commend a [[soul]] of several stages, that knows [[know]] both how to stretch
and to slacken itself; that finds itself at ease in all conditions
whither [[fortune]] leads it; that can discourse with a neighbour, of his
building, his hunting, his quarrels; that can chat with a carpenter or a
gardener with [[pleasure]].  i envy those who can render themselves familiar
with the meanest of their followers, and talk with them in their own way;
and dislike the [[advice]] of [[plato]],  that [[men]] should always speak in a
magisterial tone to their servants, whether [[men]] or [[women]], without being
sometimes facetious and familiar; for besides the reasons [[reason]] i have given,
‘tis inhuman and [[unjust]] to set so [[great]] a value upon this pitiful
prerogative of [[fortune]], and the polities wherein less disparity is
permitted betwixt masters and servants seem to me the most equitable.
others study how to raise and elevate their minds [[mind]]; i, how to humble mine
and to bring it low; ‘tis only vicious in extension:

                   “narras et genus aeaci,
                    et pugnata sacro bella sub ilio
                    quo chium pretio cadum
                    mercemur, quis aquam temperet ignibus,
                    quo praebente domum, et quota,
                    pelignis caream frigoribus, taces.”

     [“you tell us long stories about the [[race]] of aeacus, and the battles
     fought under [[sacred]] ilium; but what to give for a cask of chian
     wine, who shall prepare the warm bath, and in whose house, and when
     i may escape from the pelignian cold, you do not tell us.”
      --horace, od., iii. 19, 3.]

thus, as the lacedaemonian valour stood in need of moderation, and of the
sweet and harmonious sound of flutes to soften it in [[battle]], lest they
should precipitate themselves into temerity and fury, whereas all other
nations commonly make use of harsh and shrill sounds, and of loud and
imperious cries, to incite and heat the soldier’s [[courage]] to the last
degree; so, methinks, contrary to the usual method, in the practice of
our minds [[mind]], we have for the most part more need of lead than of wings; of
temperance and composedness than of ardour and agitation.  but, above all
things, ‘tis in my [[opinion]] egregiously to play the [[fool]], to put on the
grave airs of a [[man]] of lofty [[mind]] amongst those who are nothing of the
sort: ever to speak in print (by the book),

                    “favellare in puma di forchetta.”

          [“to talk with the point of a fork,” (affectedly)]

you must let yourself down to those with whom you converse; and sometimes
affect ignorance: lay aside [[power]] and subtilty in [[common]] conversation; to
preserve decorum and order ‘tis enough-nay, crawl on the [[earth]], if they
so [[desire]] it.

the learned often stumble at this stone; they will always be parading
their pedantic [[science]], and strew their books [[book]] everywhere; they have, in
these days, so filled the cabinets and ears of the ladies [[lady]] with them, that
if they have lost the substance, they at least retain the words; so as in
all discourse upon all sorts of subjects [[subject]], how mean and [[common]] soever,
they speak and write after a new and learned way,

         “hoc sermone pavent, hoc iram, gaudia, curas,
          hoc cuncta effundunt animi secreta; quid ultra?
          concumbunt docte;”

     [“in this [[language]] do they express their fears [[fear]], their anger, their
     joys, their cares [[care]]; in this pour out all their secrets; what more?
     they [[lie]] with their lovers learnedly.”--juvenal, vi. 189.]

and quote [[plato]] and aquinas in things the first [[man]] they meet could
determine as well; the learning that cannot penetrate their souls [[soul]] hangs
still upon the tongue. if [[people]] of quality will be persuaded by me, they
shall content themselves with setting out their proper and natural
treasures; they conceal and cover their beauties [[beauty]] under others that are
none of theirs: ‘tis a [[great]] folly to put out their own [[light]] and shine
by a borrowed lustre: they are interred and buried under ‘de capsula
totae”--[painted and perfumed from head to foot.” (or:) “as if they were
things carefully deposited in a band-box.”--seneca, ep. 115]--it is
because they do not sufficiently [[know]] themselves or do themselves
justice: the [[world]] has nothing fairer than they; ‘tis for them to honour
the [[arts]], and to paint painting.  what need have they of anything but to
live beloved and honoured?  they have and [[know]] but too much for this:
they need do no more but rouse and heat a little the faculties they have
of their own.  when i see them tampering with rhetoric, [[law]], [[logic]], and
other drugs, so improper and unnecessary for their [[business]], i begin to
suspect that the [[men]] who inspire them with such fancies, do it that they
may govern them upon that account; for what other excuse can i contrive?
it is enough that they can, without our instruction, compose the graces
of their [[eyes]] to gaiety, severity, sweetness, and season a denial with
asperity, suspense, or favour:  they need not another to interpret what
we speak for their service; with this [[knowledge]], they command with a
switch, and [[rule]] both the tutors and the schools.  but if, nevertheless,
it angers them to give place to us in anything whatever, and will, out of
curiosity, have their share in books [[book]], poetry is a diversion proper for
them; ‘tis a wanton, subtle, dissembling, and prating art [[arts]], all pleasure
and all show, like themselves.  they may also abstract several
commodities from [[history]].  in [[philosophy]], out of the [[moral]] part of it,
they may select such instructions as will [[teach]] them to [[judge]] of our
humours and conditions, to defend themselves from our treacheries, to
regulate the ardour of their own desires [[desire]], to manage their [[liberty]], to
lengthen the pleasures [[pleasure]] of [[life]], and gently to bear the inconstancy of a
lover, the rudeness of a husband; and the importunity of years, wrinkles,
and the like.  this is the utmost of what i would allow them in the
sciences.

there are some particular natures [[nature]] that are private and retired: my
natural way is proper for communication, and apt to lay me open; i am all
without and in sight, born for [[society]] and [[friendship]].  the solitude that
i [[love]] myself and recommend to others, is chiefly no other than to
withdraw my thoughts [[thought]] and affections into myself; to restrain and check,
not my steps, but my own cares [[care]] and desires [[desire]], resigning all foreign
solicitude, and mortally avoiding servitude and obligation, and not so
much the crowd of [[men]] as the crowd of [[business]].  local solitude, to say
the [[truth]], rather gives me more room and sets me more at large; i more
readily throw myself upon affairs of [[state]] and the [[world]] when i am alone.
at the louvre and in the bustle of the court, i fold myself within my own
skin; the crowd thrusts me upon myself; and i never entertain myself so
wantonly, with so much licence, or so especially, as in places of respect
and ceremonious prudence: our follies do not make me laugh, it is our
wisdom which does.  i am naturally no [[enemy]] to a court, [[life]]; i have
therein passed a part of my own, and am of a [[humour]] cheerfully to
frequent [[great]] company, provided it be by intervals and at my own [[time]]:
but this softness of [[judgment]] whereof i speak ties me perforce to
solitude.  even at [[home]], amidst a numerous [[family]], and in a house
sufficiently frequented, i see [[people]] enough, but rarely such with whom i
delight to converse; and i there reserve both for myself and others an
unusual [[liberty]]: there is in my house no such thing as [[ceremony]],
ushering, or waiting upon [[people]] down to the coach, and such other
troublesome ceremonies [[ceremony]] as our courtesy enjoins (o the servile and
importunate custom!).  every one there governs himself according to his
own method; let who will speak his thoughts [[thought]], i sit mute, meditating and
shut up in my closet, without any offence to my guests.

the [[men]] whose [[society]] and familiarity i covet are those they call sincere
and able [[men]]; and the image of these makes me disrelish the rest.  it is,
if rightly taken, the rarest of our forms, and a form that we chiefly owe
to [[nature]].  the end of this commerce is simply privacy, frequentation and
conference, the exercise of souls [[soul]], without other fruit.  in our
discourse, all subjects [[subject]] are alike to me; let there be neither weight, nor
depth, ‘tis all one: there is yet grace and pertinency; all there is
tinted with a mature and constant [[judgment]], and mixed with goodness,
freedom, gaiety, and [[friendship]].  ‘tis not only in talking of the affairs
of kings [[king]] and [[state]] that our wits discover their [[force]] and [[beauty]], but
every whit as much in private conferences.  i [[understand]] my [[men]] even by
their [[silence]] and smiles; and [[better]] discover them, perhaps, at table
than in the council.  hippomachus said, very well, “that he could know
the [[good]] wrestlers by only seeing them walk in the street.”  if learning
please to step into our talk, it shall not be rejected, not magisterial,
imperious, and importunate, as-it commonly is, but suffragan and docile
itself; we there only seek to pass away our [[time]]; when we have a [[mind]] to
be instructed and preached to, we will go seek this in its [[throne]]; please
let it humble itself to us for the nonce; for, useful and profitable as
it is, i imagine that, at need, we may manage well enough without it, and
do our [[business]] without its assistance.  a well-descended [[soul]], and
practised in the conversation of [[men]], will of herself render herself
sufficiently agreeable; art [[arts]] is nothing but the counterpart and register
of what such souls [[soul]] [[produce]].

the conversation also of beautiful and honourable [[women]] is for me a sweet
commerce:

               “nam nos quoque oculos eruditos habemus.”

     [“for we also have [[eyes]] that are versed in the matter.”
      --cicero, paradox, v. 2.]

if the [[soul]] has not therein so much to enjoy, as in the first the bodily
senses, which participate more of this, bring it to a proportion next to,
though, in my [[opinion]], not [[equal]] to the other.  but ‘tis a commerce
wherein a [[man]] must stand a little upon his guard, especially those, where
the [[body]] can do much, as in me.  i there scalded myself in my [[youth]], and
suffered all the torments that poets say befall those who precipitate
themselves into [[love]] without order and [[judgment]].  it is true that that
whipping has made me wiser since:

              “quicumque argolica de classe capharea fugit,
               semper ab euboicis vela retorquet aquis.”

     [“whoever of the grecian fleet has escaped the capharean rocks, ever
     takes [[care]] to steer from the euboean sea.”--ovid, trist., i. i, 83.]

‘tis folly to fix all a man’s thoughts [[thought]] upon it, and to engage in it with
a furious and indiscreet affection; but, on the other hand, to engage
there without [[love]] and without inclination, like comedians, to play a
common part, without putting anything to it of his own but words, is
indeed to provide for his safety, but, withal, after as cowardly a manner
as he who should abandon his [[honour]], [[profit]], or [[pleasure]] for [[fear]] of
danger.  for it is [[certain]] that from such a practice, they who set it on
foot can expect no fruit that can please or satisfy a [[noble]] [[soul]].  a man
must have, in [[good]] earnest, [[desired]] that which he, in [[good]] earnest,
expects to have a [[pleasure]] in enjoying; i say, though [[fortune]] should
unjustly favour their dissimulation; which often falls out, because there
is none of the [[sex]], let her be as ugly as the [[devil]], who does not think
herself well worthy to be beloved, and who does not prefer herself before
other [[women]], either for her [[youth]], the colour of her hair, or her
graceful motion (for there are no more [[women]] universally ugly, than there
are [[women]] universally beautiful, and such of the brahmin virgins as have
nothing else to recommend them, the [[people]] being assembled by the common
crier to that effect, come out into the market-place to expose their
matrimonial parts to [[public]] view, to try if these at least are not of
temptation sufficient to get them a husband).  consequently, there is not
one who does not easily suffer herself to be overcome by the first vow
that they make to serve her.  now from this [[common]] and ordinary treachery
of the [[men]] of the [[present]] day, that must fall out which we already
experimentally see, either that they rally together, and separate
themselves by themselves to evade us, or else form their discipline by
the [[example]] we give them, play their parts of the farce as we do ours,
and give themselves up to the [[sport]], without passion, [[care]], or [[love]];

          “neque afl’ectui suo, aut alieno, obnoxiae;”

     [“neither amenable to their own affections, nor those of others.”
      --tacitus, annal., xiii. 45.]

believing, according to the persuasion of lysias in [[plato]], that they may
with more utility and convenience [[surrender]] themselves up to us the less
we [[love]] them; where it will fall out, as in comedies, that the people
will have as much [[pleasure]] or more than the comedians.  for my part,
i no more acknowledge a [[venus]] without a cupid than, a [[mother]] without
issue: they are things that mutully lend and owe their essence to one
another.  thus this [[cheat]] recoils upon him who is guilty of it; it does
not cost him much, indeed, but he also gets little or nothing by it.
they who have made [[venus]] a [[goddess]] have taken notice that her principal
beauty was incorporeal and [[spiritual]]; but the [[venus]] whom these people
hunt after is not so much as [[human]], nor indeed brutal; the very beasts
will not accept it so gross and so earthly; we see that [[imagination]] and
desire often heat and incite them before the [[body]] does; we see in both
the one [[sex]] and the other, they have in the herd [[choice]] and particular
election in their affections, and that they have amongst themselves a
long commerce of [[good]] will.  even those to whom old [[age]] denies the
practice of their [[desire]], still tremble, neigh, and twitter for [[love]]; we
see them, before the act, full of [[hope]] and ardour, and when the [[body]] has
played its game, yet please themselves with the sweet remembrance of the
past delight; some that swell with [[pride]] after they have performed, and
others who, tired and sated, still by vociferation express a triumphing
joy.  he who has nothing to do but only to discharge his [[body]] of a
natural necessity, need not trouble others with so [[curious]] preparations:
it is not meat for a gross, coarse appetite.

as one who does not [[desire]] that [[men]] should [[think]] me [[better]] than i am,
i will here say this as to the errors of my [[youth]].  not only from the
danger of impairing my health (and yet i could not be so careful but that
i had two [[light]] mischances), but moreover upon the account of contempt,
i have seldom given myself up to [[common]] and mercenary embraces: i would
heighten the [[pleasure]] by the difficulty, by [[desire]], and a [[certain]] [[kind]] of
glory, and was of tiberius’s [[mind]], who in his amours was as much taken
with modesty and birth as any other quality, and of the courtesan flora’s
humour, who never lent herself to less than a dictator, a consul, or a
censor, and took [[pleasure]] in the [[dignity]] of her lovers.  doubtless pearls
and gold tissue, titles and train, add something to it.

as to the rest, i had a [[great]] esteem for wit, provided the [[person]] was not
exceptionable; for, to confess the [[truth]], if the one or the other of
these two attractions must of necessity be wanting, i should rather have
quitted that of the understanding, that has its use in [[better]] things;
but in the [[subject]] of [[love]], a [[subject]] principally relating to the senses
of seeing and touching, something may be done without the graces of the
mind: without the graces of the [[body]], nothing.  [[beauty]] is the true
prerogative of [[women]], and so peculiarly their own, that ours, though
naturally requiring another sort of feature, is never in its lustre but
when youthful and beardless, a sort of confused image of theirs.  ‘tis
said that such as serve the grand signior upon the account of [[beauty]], who
are an infinite number, are, at the latest, dismissed at two-and-twenty
years of [[age]].  [[reason]], prudence, and the offices of [[friendship]] are better
found amongst [[men]], and therefore it is that they govern the affairs of
the [[world]].

these two engagements are fortuitous, and depending upon others; the one
is troublesome by its rarity, the other withers with [[age]], so that they
could never have been sufficient for the [[business]] of my [[life]].  that of
books, which is the third, is much more [[certain]], and much more our own.
it yields all other advantages to the two first, but has the constancy
and facility of its service for its own share.  it goes side by side with
me in my whole course, and everywhere is assisting me: it comforts me in
old [[age]] and solitude; it eases me of a troublesome weight of idleness,
and delivers me at all hours from company that i dislike: it blunts the
point of griefs, if they are not extreme, and have not got an entire
possession of my [[soul]].  to divert myself from a troublesome fancy, ‘tis
but to run to my books [[book]]; they presently fix me to them and drive the other
out of my thoughts [[thought]], and do not mutiny at seeing that i have only recourse
to them for want of other more real, [[natural]], and lively commodities;
they always receive me with the same [[kindness]].  he may well go a foot,
they say, who leads his horse in his hand; and our james, [[king]] of naples
and sicily, who, handsome, [[young]] and healthful, caused himself to be
carried about on a barrow, extended upon a pitiful mattress in a poor
robe of grey cloth, and a cap of the same, yet attended withal by a royal
train, litters, [[led]] horses of all sorts, gentlemen and officers, did yet
herein represent a tender and unsteady [[authority]]: “the sick [[man]] has not
to [[complain]] who has his cure in his sleeve.”  in the [[experience]] and
practice of this [[maxim]], which is a very true one, consists all the
benefit i reap from books [[book]].  as a matter of [[fact]], i make no more use of
them, as it were, than those who [[know]] them not.  i enjoy them as misers
do their [[money]], in knowing that i may enjoy them when i please: my mind
is satisfied with this [[right]] of possession.  i never travel without
books, either in [[peace]] or [[war]]; and yet sometimes i pass over several
days, and sometimes months, without looking on them.  i will read
by-and-by, say i to myself, or to-morrow, or when i please; and in the
interim, [[time]] steals away without any inconvenience.  for it is not to be
imagined to what [[degree]] i please myself and rest content in this
consideration, that i have them by me to divert myself with them when i
am so disposed, and to call to [[mind]] what a refreshment they are to my
life.  ‘tis the [[best]] viaticum i have yet found out for this human
journey, and i very much [[pity]] those [[men]] of understanding who are
unprovided of it.  i the rather accept of any other sort of diversion,
how [[light]] soever, because this can never fail me.

when at [[home]], i a little more frequent my library, whence i overlook at
once all the concerns of my [[family]].  ‘tis situated at the entrance into
my house, and i thence see under me my garden, court, and base-court, and
almost all parts of the building.  there i turn over now one [[book]], and
then another, on various subjects [[subject]], without method or design.  one while
i meditate, another i record and dictate, as i walk to and fro, such
whimsies as these i [[present]] to you here.  ‘tis in the third storey of a
tower, of which the ground-room is my chapel, the second storey a chamber
with a withdrawing-room and closet, where i often [[lie]], to be more
retired; and above is a [[great]] wardrobe.  this formerly was the most
useless part of the house.  i there pass away both most of the days of my
life and most of the hours of those days.  in the night i am never there.
there is by the side of it a cabinet handsome enough, with a fireplace
very commodiously contrived, and plenty of [[light]]; and were i not more
afraid of the trouble than the expense--the trouble that frights me from
all business--i could very easily adjoin on either side, and on the same
floor, a gallery of an hundred paces long and twelve broad, having found
walls already raised for some other design to the requisite height.
every place of retirement requires a walk: my thoughts [[thought]] sleep if i sit
still: my fancy does not go by itself, as when my legs move it: and all
those who study without a [[book]] are in the same condition.  the figure of
my study is round, and there is no more open wall than what is taken up
by my table and my chair, so that the remaining parts of the circle
present me a view of all my books [[book]] at once, ranged upon five rows of
shelves round about me.  it has three [[noble]] and [[free]] prospects, and is
sixteen paces in diameter.  i am not so continually there in winter; for
my house is built upon an eminence, as its name imports, and no part of
it is so much exposed to the wind and weather as this, which pleases me
the [[better]], as being of more difficult access and a little remote, as
well upon the account of exercise, as also being there more retired from
the crowd.  ‘tis there that i am in my [[kingdom]], and there i endeavour to
make myself an absolute monarch, and to sequester this one corner from
all [[society]], conjugal, filial, and civil; elsewhere i have but verbal
authority only, and of a confused essence.  that [[man]], in my [[opinion]], is
very miserable, who has not at [[home]] where to be by himself, where to
entertain himself alone, or to conceal himself from others.  ambition
sufficiently plagues her proselytes, by keeping them always in show, like
the statue of a [[public]], square:

                    “magna servitus est magna fortuna.”

               [“a [[great]] [[fortune]] is a [[great]] [[slavery]].”
                --seneca, de consol. ad.  polyb., c.  26.]

they cannot so much as be private in the watercloset.  i have thought
nothing so severe in the austerity of [[life]] that our monks affect, as what
i have observed in some of their communities [[community]]; namely, by [[rule]], to have a
perpetual [[society]] of place, and numerous persons [[person]] [[present]] in every action
whatever; and [[think]] it much more supportable to be always alone than
never to be so.

if any one shall tell me that it is to undervalue the muses to make use
of them only for [[sport]] and to pass away the [[time]], i shall tell him, that
he does not [[know]] so well as i the value of the [[sport]], the [[pleasure]], and
the pastime; i can hardly forbear to add that all other end is
ridiculous.  i [[live]] from day to day, and, with reverence be it spoken, i
only [[live]] for myself; there all my designs terminate.  i [[studied]], when
young, for ostentation; since, to make myself a little wiser; and now for
my diversion, but never for any [[profit]].  a [[vain]] and prodigal [[humour]] i had
after this sort of furniture, not only for the supplying my own need,
but, moreover, for ornament and outward show, i have since quite cured
myself of.

books have many charming qualities to such as [[know]] how to choose them;
but every [[good]] has its ill; ‘tis a [[pleasure]] that is not pure and clean,
no more than others: it has its inconveniences, and [[great]] ones too.  the
soul indeed is exercised therein; but the [[body]], the [[care]] of which i must
withal never neglect, remains in the meantime without action, and grows
heavy and sombre.  i [[know]] no excess more prejudicial to me, nor more to
be avoided in this my declining [[age]].

these have been my three favourite and particular occupations; i speak
not of those i owe to the [[world]] by civil obligation.




chapter iv.

of diversion

i was once employed in consoling a [[lady]] truly afflicted.  most of their
mournings are artificial and ceremonious:

         “uberibus semper lacrymis, semperque paratis,
          in statione subatque expectantibus illam,
          quo jubeat manare modo.”

     [“a woman has ever a fountain of tears ready to gush up whenever
     she requires to make use of them.”--juvenal, vi. 272.]

a [[man]] goes the [[wrong]] way to [[work]] when he opposes this passion; for
opposition does but irritate and make them more obstinate in [[sorrow]]; the
evil is exasperated by discussion.  we see, in [[common]] discourse, that
what i have indifferently let fall from me, if any one takes it up to
controvert it, i justify it with the [[best]] arguments i have; and much more
a thing wherein i had a real interest.  and besides, in so doing you
enter roughly upon your operation; whereas the first addresses of a
physician to his patient should be gracious, [[gay]], and pleasing; never did
any ill-looking, morose physician do anything to [[purpose]].  on the
contrary, then, a [[man]] should, at the first approaches, favour their grief
and express some approbation of their [[sorrow]].  by this [[intelligence]] you
obtain credit to proceed further, and by a facile and insensible
gradation fall into discourses more solid and proper for their cure.
i, whose aim it was principally to gull the company who had their eyes
fixed upon me, took it into my head only to palliate the disease.  and
indeed i have found by [[experience]] that i have an unlucky hand in
persuading.  my arguments are either too sharp and dry, or pressed too
roughly, or not [[home]] enough.  after i had some [[time]] applied myself to her
grief, i did not attempt to cure her by [[strong]] and lively reasons [[reason]], either
because i had them not at hand, or because i [[thought]] to do my business
better another way; neither did i make [[choice]] of any of those methods of
consolation which [[philosophy]] prescribes: that what we [[complain]] of is no
evil, according to cleanthes; that it is a [[light]] [[evil]], according to the
peripatetics; that to bemoan one’s [[self]] is an action neither commendable
nor just, according to chrysippus; nor this of epicurus, more suitable to
my way, of shifting the thoughts [[thought]] from afflicting things to those that are
pleasing; nor making a bundle of all these together, to make use of upon
occasion, according to cicero; but, gently bending my discourse, and by
little and little digressing, sometimes to subjects [[subject]] nearer, and sometimes
more remote from the [[purpose]], according as she was more intent on what i
said, i imperceptibly [[led]] her from that sorrowful [[thought]], and kept her
calm and in good-humour whilst i continued there.  i herein made use of
diversion.  they who succeeded me in the same service did not, for all
that, find any amendment in her, for i had not gone to the root.

i, peradventure, may elsewhere have glanced upon some sort of public
diversions; and the practice of [[military]] ones, which pericles made use of
in the peloponnesian [[war]], and a thousand others in other places, to
withdraw the adverse forces [[force]] from their own countries [[country]], is too frequent in
history.  it was an ingenious evasion whereby monseigneur d’hempricourt
saved both himself and others in the [[city]] of liege, into which the duke
of burgundy, who kept it besieged, had made him enter to execute the
articles of their promised [[surrender]]; the [[people]], being assembled by
night to consider of it, began to mutiny against the agreement, and
several of them resolved to fall upon the commissioners, whom they had in
their [[power]]; he, feeling the gusts of this first popular storm, who were
coming to rush into his lodgings, suddenly sent out to them two of the
inhabitants of the [[city]] (of whom he had some with him) with new and
milder terms to be proposed in their council, which he had then and there
contrived for his need: these two diverted the first tempest, carrying
back the enraged rabble to the town-hall to hear and consider of what
they had to say.  the deliberation was short; a second storm arose as
violent as the other, whereupon he despatched four new mediators of the
same quality to meet them, protesting that he had now [[better]] conditions
to [[present]] them with, and such as would give them absolute satisfaction,
by which means the tumult was once more appeased, and the [[people]] again
turned back to the conclave.  in fine, by this dispensation of
amusements, one after another, diverting their fury and dissipating it in
frivolous consultations, he laid it at [[last]] asleep till the day appeared,
which was his principal end.

this other story that follows is also of the same category.  atalanta, a
virgin of excelling [[beauty]] and of wonderful disposition of [[body]], to
disengage herself from the crowd of a thousand suitors who sought her in
marriage, made this proposition, that she would accept of him for her
husband who should [[equal]] her in running, upon condition that they who
failed should lose their lives [[life]].  there were enough who [[thought]] the prize
very well worth the hazard, and who [[suffered]] the cruel penalty of the
contract.  hippomenes, about to make [[trial]] after the rest, made his
address to the [[goddess]] of [[love]], imploring her assistance; and she,
granting his request, gave him three golden apples, and instructed him
how to use them.  the [[race]] beginning, as hippomenes perceived his
mistress to press hard up to him; he, as it were by [[chance]], let fall one
of these apples; the maid, taken with the [[beauty]] of it, failed not to
step out of her way to pick it up:

              “obstupuit virgo, nitidique cupidine pomi
               declinat cursus, aurumque volubile tollit.”

     [“the virgin, astonished and attracted by the glittering apple,
     stops her [[career]], and seizes the rolling gold.”
      --ovid, metam., x. 666.]

he did the same, when he saw his [[time]], by the second and the third, till
by so diverting her, and making her lose so much ground, he won the [[race]].
when physicians cannot stop a catarrh, they divert and turn it into some
other less dangerous part.  and i find also that this is the most
ordinary practice for the diseases of the [[mind]]:

          “abducendus etiam nonnunquam animus est ad alia studia,
          sollicitudines, curas, negotia: loci denique mutatione,
          tanquam aegroti non convalescentes, saepe curandus est.”

     [“the [[mind]] is sometimes to be diverted to other studies, thoughts [[thought]],
     cares [[care]], [[business]]: in fine, by [[change]] of place, as where sick persons
     do not become convalescent.”--cicero, tusc. quaes., iv. 35.]

‘tis to little effect directly to jostle a man’s infirmities; we neither
make him sustain nor repel the attack; we only make him decline and evade
it.

this other lesson is too high and too difficult: ‘tis for [[men]] of the
first form of [[knowledge]] purely to insist upon the thing, to consider and
judge it; it appertains to one sole [[socrates]] to meet [[death]] with an
ordinary countenance, to grow acquainted with it, and to [[sport]] with it;
he seeks no consolation out of the thing itself; dying appears to him a
natural and indifferent accident; ‘tis there that he fixes his sight and
resolution, without looking elsewhere.  the disciples of hegesias, who
starved themselves to [[death]], animated thereunto by his fine lectures, and
in such numbers that [[king]] ptolemy ordered he should be forbidden to
entertain his followers with such homicidal doctrines, did not consider
death in itself, neither did they [[judge]] of it; it was not there they
fixed their thoughts [[thought]]; they ran towards and aimed at a new being.

the [[poor]] wretches whom we see brought upon the scaffold, full of ardent
devotion, and therein, as much as in them lies [[lie]], employing all their
senses, their ears in hearing the instructions given them, their [[eyes]] and
hands lifted up towards [[heaven]], their voices in loud prayers, with a
vehement and continual emotion, do doubtless things very commendable and
proper for such a necessity: we ought to commend them for their devotion,
but not properly for their constancy; they shun the encounter, they
divert their thoughts [[thought]] from the consideration of [[death]], as [[children]] are
amused with some toy or other when the surgeon is going to give them a
prick with his lancet.  i have seen some, who, casting their [[eyes]] upon
the dreadful instruments of [[death]] round about, have fainted, and
furiously turned their thoughts [[thought]] another way; such as are to pass a
formidable precipice are advised either to shut their [[eyes]] or to look
another way.

subrius flavius, being by nero’s command to be put to [[death]], and by the
hand of niger, both of them [[great]] captains, when they lead him to the
place appointed for his execution, seeing the grave that niger had caused
to be hollowed to put him into ill-made: “neither is this,” said he,
turning to the soldiers who guarded him, “according to military
discipline.”  and to niger, who exhorted him to keep his head firm: “do
but thou strike as firmly,” said he.  and he very well foresaw what would
follow when he said so; for niger’s arm so trembled that he had several
blows at his head before he could cut it off.  this [[man]] seems to have had
his thoughts [[thought]] rightly fixed upon the [[subject]].

he who dies in a [[battle]], with his [[sword]] in his hand, does not then think
of [[death]]; he feels [[feel]] or considers it not; the ardour of the [[fight]] diverts
his [[thought]] another way.  a worthy [[man]] of my acquaintance, falling as he
was fighting a duel, and feeling himself nailed to the [[earth]] by nine or
ten thrusts of his [[enemy]], every one [[present]] called to him to [[think]] of his
conscience; but he has since told me, that though he very well heard what
they said, it nothing moved him, and that he never [[thought]] of anything
but how to disengage and [[revenge]] himself.  he afterwards killed his man
in that very duel.  he who brought to l. silanus the sentence of [[death]],
did him a very [[great]] [[kindness]], in that, having received his [[answer]], that
he was well prepared to [[die]], but not by base hands, he ran upon him with
his soldiers to [[force]] him, and as he, unarmed as he was, obstinately
defended himself with his fists and feet, he made him lose his [[life]] in
the contest, by that means dissipating and diverting in a sudden and
furious rage the painful apprehension of the lingering [[death]] to which he
was designed.

we always [[think]] of something else; either the [[hope]] of a [[better]] life
comforts and supports us, or the [[hope]] of our children’s worth, or the
future [[glory]] of our name, or the leaving behind the evils [[evil]] of this [[life]],
or the vengeance that threatens those who are the causes of our [[death]],
administers consolation to us:

         “spero equidem mediis, si quid pia numina possunt,
          supplicia hausurum scopulis, et nomine dido
          saepe vocaturum .  .  .  .
          audiam; et haec manes veniet mihi fama sub imos.”

     [“i [[hope]], however, if the pious gods have any [[power]], thou wilt feel
     thy [[punishment]] amid the rocks, and will call on the name of dido;
     i shall hear, and this report will come to me below.”--aeneid, iv.
     382, 387.]

xenophon was sacrificing with a [[crown]] upon his head when one came to
bring him news of the [[death]] of his [[son]] gryllus, slain in the [[battle]] of
mantinea: at the first surprise of the news, he threw his [[crown]] to the
ground; but understanding by the sequel of the narrative the manner of a
most brave and valiant [[death]], he took it up and replaced it upon his
head.  epicurus himself, at his [[death]], consoles himself upon the utility
and eternity of his writings:

          “omnes clari et nobilitati labores fiunt tolerabiles;”

     [“all labours [[labour]] that are illustrious and famous become supportable.”
      --cicero, tusc.  quaes., ii. 26.]

and the same wound, the same fatigue, is not, says xenophon, so
intolerable to a general of an [[army]] as to a [[common]] soldier.  epaminondas
took his [[death]] much more cheerfully, having been informed that the
victory remained to him:

          “haec sunt solatia, haec fomenta summorum dolorum;”

     [“these are sedatives and alleviations to the [[greatest]] pains [[pain]].”
      --cicero, tusc. quaes., ii.  23.]

and such like circumstances amuse, divert, and turn our thoughts [[thought]] from the
consideration of the thing in itself.  even the arguments of philosophy
are always edging and glancing on the matter, so as scarce to rub its
crust; the [[greatest]] [[man]] of the first philosophical school, and
superintendent over all the rest, the [[great]] zeno, forms this syllogism
against [[death]]: “no [[evil]] is honourable; but [[death]] is honourable; therefore
death is no evil”; against drunkenness this: “no one commits his secrets
to a drunkard; but every one commits his secrets to a [[wise]] [[man]]: therefore
a [[wise]] [[man]] is no drunkard.”  is this to hit the [[white]]?  i [[love]] to see
that these [[great]] and leading souls [[soul]] cannot rid themselves of our company:
perfect [[men]] as they are, they are yet simply [[men]].

revenge is a sweet passion, of [[great]] and [[natural]] impression; i discern it
well enough, though i have no manner of [[experience]] of it.  from this not
long ago to divert a [[young]] [[prince]], i did not tell him that he must, to
him that had struck him upon the one cheek, turn the other, upon account
of charity; nor go about to represent to him the tragical events that
poetry attributes to this passion.  i left that behind; and i busied
myself to make him relish the [[beauty]] of a contrary image: and, by
representing to him what [[honour]], esteem, and goodwill he would acquire by
clemency and [[good]] [[nature]], diverted him to [[ambition]].  thus a [[man]] is to
deal in such cases.

if your passion of [[love]] be too [[violent]], disperse it, say they, and they
say true; for i have often tried it with advantage: break it into several
desires, of which let one be regent, if you will, over the rest; but,
lest it should tyrannise and domineer over you, weaken and protract, by
dividing and diverting it:

               “cum morosa vago singultiet inguine vena,”

     [“when you are tormented with fierce [[desire]], satisfy it with the
     first [[person]] that presents [[present]] herself.”--persius, sat., vi. 73.]

          “conjicito humorem collectum in corpora quaeque,”

          [lucretius, vi. 1062, to the like effect.]

and provide for it in [[time]], lest it prove troublesome to deal with, when
it has once seized you:

              “si non prima novis conturbes vulnera plagis,
               volgivagaque vagus venere ante recentia cures.”

          [“unless you cure old wounds by new.”-lucretius, iv. 1064.]

i was once wounded with a vehement displeasure, and withal, more just
than vehement; i might peradventure have lost myself in it, if i had
merely trusted to my own [[strength]].  having need of a powerful diversion
to disengage me, by art [[arts]] and study i became amorous, wherein i was
assisted by my [[youth]]: [[love]] relieved and rescued me from the [[evil]] wherein
friendship had engaged me.  ‘tis in everything else the same; a violent
imagination hath seized me: i find it a nearer way to [[change]] than to
subdue it: i depute, if not one contrary, yet another at least, in its
place.  variation ever relieves, dissolves, and dissipates.

if i am not able to contend with it, i escape from it; and in avoiding
it, slip out of the way, and make, my doubles; shifting place, [[business]],
and company, i secure myself in the crowd of other thoughts [[thought]] and fancies,
where it loses my trace, and i escape.

after the same manner does [[nature]] proceed, by the benefit of inconstancy;
for [[time]], which she has given us for the [[sovereign]] physician of our
passions, chiefly works [[work]] by this, that supplying our imaginations [[imagination]] with
other and new affairs, it loosens and dissolves the first apprehension,
how [[strong]] soever.  a [[wise]] [[man]] little less sees his friend dying at the
end of five-and-twenty years than on the first year; and according to
epicurus, no less at all; for he did not attribute any alleviation of
afflictions, either to their foresight or their antiquity; but so many
other thoughts [[thought]] traverse this, that it languishes and tires at [[last]].

alcibiades, to divert the inclination of [[common]] rumours, cut off the ears
and tail of his beautiful dog, and turned him out into the [[public]] place,
to the end that, giving the [[people]] this [[occasion]] to prate, they might let
his other actions alone.  i have also seen, for this same end of
diverting the opinions [[opinion]] and conjectures of the [[people]] and to stop their
mouths, some [[women]] conceal their real affections by those that were only
counterfeit; but i have also seen some of them, who in counterfeiting
have [[suffered]] themselves to be caught indeed, and who have quitted the
true and original affection for the feigned: and so have learned that
they who find their affections well placed are fools [[fool]] to [[consent]] to this
disguise: the [[public]] and favourable reception being only reserved for
this pretended lover, one may conclude him a fellow of very little
address and less wit, if he does not in the end put himself into your
place, and you into his; this is precisely to cut out and make up a shoe
for another to draw on.

a little thing will turn and divert us, because a little thing holds us.
we do not much consider subjects [[subject]] in gross and singly; they are little and
superficial circumstances, or images that touch us, and the outward
useless rinds that peel off from the subjects [[subject]] themselves:

         “folliculos ut nunc teretes aestate cicadae
          linquunt.”

     [“as husks we find grasshoppers leave behind them in summer.”
      --lucretius, v. 801.]

even plutarch himself laments his [[daughter]] for the little apish tricks of
her infancy.--[consolation to his [[wife]] on the [[death]] of their [[daughter]],
c. i.]--the remembrance of a farewell, of the particular grace of an
action, of a [[last]] recommendation, afflict us.  the sight of caesar’s robe
troubled all [[rome]], which was more than his [[death]] had done.  even the
sound of names ringing in our ears, as “my [[poor]] master,”--“my faithful
friend,”--“alas, my dear [[father]],” or, “my sweet [[daughter]],” afflict us.
when these repetitions annoy me, and that i examine it a little nearer,
i find ‘tis no other but a grammatical and word complaint; i am only
wounded with the word and tone, as the exclamations of preachers very
often [[work]] more upon their auditory than their reasons [[reason]], and as the
pitiful [[eyes]] of a beast killed for our service; without my weighing or
penetrating meanwhile into the true and solid essence of my [[subject]]:

               “his se stimulis dolor ipse lacessit.”

          [“with these incitements [[grief]] provokes itself.”
           --lucretius, ii. 42.]

these are the foundations of our mourning.

the obstinacy of my stone to all remedies especially those in my bladder,
has sometimes thrown me into so long suppressions of urine for three or
four days together, and so near [[death]], that it had been folly to have
hoped to evade it, and it was much rather to have been [[desired]],
considering the miseries i endure in those cruel fits.  oh, that good
emperor,  who caused criminals [[criminal]] to be tied that they might [[die]] for want of
urination, was a [[great]] master in the hangman’s’ science!  finding myself
in this condition, i considered by how many [[light]] causes and objects
imagination nourished in me the regret of [[life]]; of what atoms the weight
and difficulty of this dislodging was composed in my [[soul]]; to how many
idle and frivolous thoughts [[thought]] we give way in so [[great]] an affair; a dog, a
horse, a [[book]], a glass, and what not, were considered in my loss; to
others their ambitious hopes [[hope]], their [[money]], their [[knowledge]], not less
foolish considerations in my [[opinion]] than mine.  i look upon death
carelessly when i look upon it universally as the end of [[life]].  i insult
over it in gross, but in detail it domineers over me: the tears of a
footman, the disposing of my clothes, the touch of a friendly hand, a
common consolation, discourages and softens me.  so do the complaints in
tragedies agitate our souls [[soul]] with [[grief]]; and the regrets of dido and
ariadne, impassionate even those who [[believe]] them not in [[virgil]] and
catullus.  ‘tis a symptom of an obstinate and obdurate [[nature]] to be
sensible of no emotion, as ‘tis reported for a miracle of polemon; but
then he did not so much as alter his countenance at the biting of a mad
dog that tore away the calf of his leg; and no [[wisdom]] proceeds so far as
to conceive so vivid and entire a cause of [[sorrow]], by [[judgment]] that it
does not suffer increase by its presence, when the [[eyes]] and ears have
their share; parts that are not to be moved but by [[vain]] accidents.

is it [[reason]] that even the [[arts]] themselves should make an advantage of
our [[natural]] stupidity and weakness?  an orator, says rhetoric in the
farce of his pleading, shall be moved with the sound of his own voice and
feigned emotions, and suffer himself to be imposed upon by the passion he
represents; he will imprint in himself a true and real [[grief]], by means of
the part he plays, to transmit it to the judges [[judge]], who are yet less
concerned than he: as they do who are hired at funerals to assist in the
ceremony of [[sorrow]], who sell their tears and mourning by weight and
measure; for although they act in a borrowed form, nevertheless, by
habituating and settling their countenances to the [[occasion]], ‘tis most
certain they often are really affected with an actual [[sorrow]].  i was one,
amongst several others of his [[friends]], who conveyed the [[body]] of monsieur
de grammont to spissons from the siege of la fere, where he was slain;
i observed that in all places we passed through we filled the [[people]] we
met with lamentations and tears by the mere solemn pomp of our convoy,
for the name of the defunct was not there so much as known.  quintilian
reports as to have seen comedians so deeply engaged in a mourning part,
that they still wept in the retiring room, and who, having taken upon
them to stir up passion in another, have themselves espoused it to that
degree as to find themselves infected with it, not only to tears, but,
moreover, with pallor and the comportment of [[men]] really overwhelmed with
grief.

in a [[country]] near our mountains the [[women]] play [[priest]] martin, for as they
augment the regret of the deceased husband by the remembrance of the good
and agreeable qualities he possessed, they also at the same [[time]] make a
register of and publish his imperfections; as if of themselves to enter
into some composition, and divert themselves from compassion to disdain.
yet with much [[better]] grace than we, who, when we lose an acquaintance,
strive to give him new and false praises [[praise]], and to make him quite another
thing when we have lost sight of him than he appeared to us when we did
see him; as if regret were an instructive thing, or as if tears, by
washing our understandings, cleared them.  for my part, i henceforth
renounce all favourable testimonies [[men]] would give of me, not because i
shall be worthy of them, but because i shall be [[dead]].

whoever shall ask a [[man]], “what interest have you in this siege?”
 --“the interest of [[example]],” he will say, “and of the [[common]] [[obedience]] to
my [[prince]]: i pretend to no [[profit]] by it; and for [[glory]], i [[know]] how small
a part can affect a private [[man]] such as i: i have here neither passion
nor quarrel.”  and yet you shall see him the next day quite another [[man]],
chafing and red with fury, ranged in [[battle]] for the assault; ‘tis the
glittering of so much steel, the [[fire]] and noise of our cannon and drums,
that have infused this new rigidity and fury into his veins.  a frivolous
cause, you will say.  how a cause?  there needs none to agitate the [[mind]];
a mere whimsy without [[body]] and without [[subject]] will [[rule]] and agitate it.
let me thing of building castles in [[spain]], my [[imagination]] suggests to me
conveniences and pleasures [[pleasure]] with which my [[soul]] is really tickled and
pleased.  how often do we torment our [[mind]] with anger or [[sorrow]] by such
shadows, and engage ourselves in fantastic [[passions]] that impair both soul
and [[body]]?  what astonished, fleeting, confused grimaces does this raving
put our faces into! what sallies and agitations both of members and
voices does it inspire us with!  does it not seem that this individual
man has false visions amid the crowd of others with whom he has to do,
or that he is possessed with some internal demon that persecutes him?
inquire of yourself where is the object of this mutation?  is there
anything but us in [[nature]] which inanity sustains, over which it has
power?  cambyses, from having dreamt that his [[brother]] should be one day
king of [[persia]], put him to [[death]]: a beloved [[brother]], and one in whom he
had always confided.  aristodemus, [[king]] of the messenians, killed himself
out of a fancy of ill omen, from i [[know]] not what howling of his dogs;
and [[king]] midas did as much upon the account of some foolish [[dream]] he had
dreamed.  ‘tis to prize [[life]] at its just value, to abandon it for a
dream.  and yet hear the [[soul]] triumph over the miseries and weakness of
the [[body]], and that it is exposed to all attacks and alterations; truly,
it has [[reason]] so to speak!

              “o prima infelix finger ti terra prometheo!
               ille parum cauti pectoris egit opus
               corpora disponens, mentem non vidit in arte;
               recta animi primum debuit esse via.”

     [“o wretched clay, first formed by prometheus.  in his attempt,
     what little [[wisdom]] did he shew!  in framing bodies [[body]], he did not
     apply his art [[arts]] to form the [[mind]], which should have been his first
     [[care]].”--propertius, iii. 5, 7.]

upon some verses of virgil



chapter  v.

by how much profitable thoughts [[thought]] are more full and solid, by so much are
they also more cumbersome and heavy: [[vice]], [[death]], [[poverty]], diseases, are
grave and grievous subjects [[subject]].  a [[man]] should have his [[soul]] instructed in
the means to sustain and to contend with evils [[evil]], and in the rules [[rule]] of
living and believing well: and often rouse it up, and exercise it in this
noble study; but in an ordinary [[soul]] it must be by intervals and with
moderation; it will otherwise grow besotted if continually intent upon
it.  i found it necessary, when i was [[young]], to put myself in [[mind]] and
solicit myself to keep me to my [[duty]]; gaiety and health do not, they say,
so well agree with those grave and serious meditations: i am at present
in another [[state]]: the conditions of [[age]] but too much put me in [[mind]], urge
me to [[wisdom]], and preach to me.  from the excess of sprightliness i am
fallen into that of severity, which is much more troublesome; and for
that [[reason]] i now and then suffer myself purposely a little to run into
disorder, and occupy my [[mind]] in wanton and youthful thoughts [[thought]], wherewith
it diverts itself.  i am of late but too reserved, too heavy, and too
ripe; years every day [[read]] to me lectures of coldness and temperance.
this [[body]] of mine avoids disorder and dreads it; ‘tis now my body’s turn
to guide my [[mind]] towards reformation; it governs, in turn, and more
rudely and imperiously than the other; it lets me not an hour alone,
sleeping or waking, but is always preaching to me [[death]], patience, and
repentance.  i now defend myself from temperance, as i have formerly done
from [[pleasure]]; it draws me too much back, and even to stupidity.  now i
will be master of myself, to all intents and purposes [[purpose]]; [[wisdom]] has its
excesses, and has no less need of moderation than folly.  therefore, lest
i should wither, dry up, and overcharge myself with prudence, in the
intervals and truces my infirmities allow me:

               “mens intenta suis ne seit usque malis.”

     [“that my [[mind]] may not eternally be intent upon my ills.”
      --ovid., trist., iv. i, 4.]

i gently turn aside, and avert my [[eyes]] from the stormy and cloudy [[sky]] i
have before me, which, thanks be to [[god]], i regard without [[fear]], but not
without meditation and study, and amuse myself in the remembrance of my
better years:

                          “animus quo perdidit, optat,
               atque in praeterita se totus imagine versat.”

     [“the [[mind]] wishes [[wish]] to have what it has lost, and throws itself
     wholly into memories of the [[past]].”--petronius, c. 128.]

let [[childhood]] look forward and [[age]] backward; was not this the
signification of janus’ double face?  let years draw me along if they
will, but it shall be backward; as long as my [[eyes]] can discern the
pleasant season expired, i shall now and then turn them that way; though
it escape from my [[blood]] and veins, i shall not, however, root the image
of it out of my memory:

                                        “hoc est
                    vivere bis, vita posse priore frui.”

     [“‘tis to [[live]] twice to be able to enjoy one’s former [[life]] again.”
      --martial, x. 23, 7.]

plato ordains that old [[men]] should be [[present]] at the exercises, dances,
and sports [[sport]] of [[young]] [[people]], that they may rejoice in others for the
activity and [[beauty]] of [[body]] which is no more in themselves, and call to
mind the grace and comeliness of that flourishing [[age]]; and wills that in
these recreations the [[honour]] of the prize should be given to that young
man who has most diverted the company.  i was formerly wont to mark
cloudy and gloomy days as extraordinary; these are now my ordinary days;
the extraordinary are the clear and bright; i am ready to leap for joy,
as for an unwonted favour, when nothing happens me.  let me tickle
myself, i cannot [[force]] a [[poor]] smile from this wretched [[body]] of mine;
i am only merry in conceit and in dreaming, by artifice to divert the
melancholy of [[age]]; but, in [[faith]], it requires another remedy than a
dream.  a [[weak]] contest of art [[arts]] against [[nature]].  ‘tis [[great]] folly to
lengthen and anticipate [[human]] incommodities, as every one does; i had
rather be a less while old than be old before i am really so.’ i seize on
even the least occasions [[occasion]] of [[pleasure]] i can meet.  i [[know]] very well, by
hearsay, several sorts of prudent pleasures [[pleasure]], effectually so, and glorious
to boot; but [[opinion]] has not [[power]] enough over me to give me an appetite
to them.  i covet not so much to have them magnanimous, magnificent, and
pompous, as i do to have them sweet, facile, and ready:

               “a natura discedimus; populo nos damus,
               nullius rei bono auctori.”

     [“we depart from [[nature]] and give ourselves to the [[people]], who
     [[understand]] nothing.”--seneca, ep., 99.]

my [[philosophy]] is in action, in [[natural]] and [[present]] practice, very little
in fancy: what if i should take [[pleasure]] in playing at cob-nut or to whip
a top!

               “non ponebat enim rumores ante salutem.”

     [“he did not [[sacrifice]] his health even to rumours.” ennius, apud
     cicero, de offic., i. 24]

pleasure is a quality of very little [[ambition]]; it thinks [[think]] itself rich
enough of itself without any addition of repute; and is [[best]] pleased
where most retired.  a [[young]] [[man]] should be whipped who pretends to a
taste in wine and sauces; there was nothing which, at that [[age]], i less
valued or knew: now i begin to learn; i am very much ashamed on’t; but
what should i do?  i am more ashamed and vexed at the occasions [[occasion]] that put
me upon’t.  ‘tis for us to dote and trifle away the [[time]], and for young
men to stand upon their [[reputation]] and nice punctilios; they are going
towards the [[world]] and the world’s [[opinion]]; we are retiring from it:

     “sibi arma, sibi equos, sibi hastas, sibi clavam, sibi pilam,
     sibi natationes, et cursus habeant: nobis senibus, ex lusionibus
     multis, talos relinquant et tesseras;”

     [“let them reserve to themselves arms, horses, spears, clubs,
     tennis, swimming, and races [[race]]; and of all the sports [[sport]] leave to us old
     [[men]] cards and dice.”--cicero, de senec., c. 16.]

the laws [[law]] themselves send us [[home]].  i can do no less in favour of this
wretched condition into which my [[age]] has thrown me than furnish it with
toys to play withal, as they do [[children]]; and, in [[truth]], we become such.
both [[wisdom]] and folly will have enough to do to support and relieve me by
alternate services in this calamity of [[age]]:

               “misce stultitiam consiliis brevem.”

          [“mingle with counsels a brief interval of folly.”
           --horace, od., iv. 12, 27.]

i accordingly avoid the lightest punctures; and those that formerly would
not have rippled the skin, now pierce me through and through: my habit of
body is now so naturally declining to ill:

          “in fragili corpore odiosa omnis offensio est;”

          [“in a fragile [[body]] every shock is obnoxious.”
           --cicero, de senec., c.  18.]

          “mensque pati durum sustinet aegra nihil.”

     [“and the infirm [[mind]] can bear no difficult exertion.”
      --ovid, de ponto., i.  5, 18.]

i have ever been very susceptibly tender as to offences: i am much more
tender now, and open throughout.

               “et minimae vires frangere quassa valent.”

     [“and little [[force]] suffices to break what was cracked before.”
      --ovid, de tris., iii. 11, 22.]

my [[judgment]] restrains me from kicking against and murmuring at the
inconveniences that [[nature]] orders me to endure, but it does not take away
my feeling them: i, who have no other thing in my aim but to [[live]] and be
merry, would run from one end of the [[world]] to the other to seek out one
good year of pleasant and jocund tranquillity.  a melancholic and dull
tranquillity may be enough for me, but it benumbs and stupefies me; i am
not contented with it.  if there be any [[person]], any knot of [[good]] company
in [[country]] or [[city]], in [[france]] or elsewhere, resident or in motion, who
can like my [[humour]], and whose humours [[humour]] i can like, let them but whistle
and i will run and furnish them with essays in flesh and bone:

seeing it is the [[privilege]] of the [[mind]] to rescue itself from old [[age]], i
advise mine to it with all the [[power]] i have; let it meanwhile continue
green, and flourish if it can, like mistletoe upon a [[dead]] tree.  but i
fear ‘tis a traitor; it has contracted so strict a fraternity with the
body that it leaves me at every turn, to [[follow]] that in its need.  i
wheedle and deal with it apart in [[vain]]; i try in [[vain]] to wean it from
this correspondence, to no effect; quote to it seneca and catullus, and
ladies and [[royal]] masques; if its companion have the stone, it seems to
have it too; even the faculties that are most peculiarly and properly its
own cannot then perform their functions, but manifestly appear stupefied
and asleep; there is no sprightliness in its productions, if there be not
at the same [[time]] an [[equal]] proportion in the [[body]] too.

our masters are to blame, that in searching out the causes of the
extraordinary emotions of the [[soul]], besides attributing it to a divine
ecstasy, [[love]], martial fierceness, poesy, wine, they have not also
attributed a part to health: a boiling, vigorous, full, and lazy health,
such as formerly the verdure of [[youth]] and security, by fits, supplied me
withal; that [[fire]] of sprightliness and gaiety darts into the [[mind]] flashes
that are lively and bright beyond our [[natural]] [[light]], and of all
enthusiasms the most jovial, if not the most extravagant.

it is, then, no wonder if a contrary [[state]] stupefy and clog my spirit,
and [[produce]] a contrary effect:

          “ad nullum consurgit opus, cum corpore languet;”

     [“when the [[mind]] is languishing, the [[body]] is [[good]] for nothing.”
      (or:) “it rises to no effort; it languishes with the [[body]].”
      --pseudo gallus, i. 125.]

and yet would have me obliged to it for giving, as it wants to make out,
much less [[consent]] to this stupidity than is the ordinary case with [[men]] of
my [[age]].  let us, at least, whilst we have truce, drive away incommodities
and difficulties from our commerce:

          “dum licet, obducta solvatur fronte senectus:”

     [“whilst we can, let us banish old [[age]] from the brow.”
      --herod., ep., xiii. 7.]

               “tetrica sunt amcenanda jocularibus.”

     [“sour things are to be sweetened with those that are pleasant.”
      --sidonius apollin., ep., i. 9.]

i [[love]] a [[gay]] and civil [[wisdom]], and fly from all sourness and austerity of
manners, all repellent, mien being suspected by me:

               “tristemque vultus tetrici arrogantiam:”

          [“the arrogant sadness of a crabbed face.”--auctor incert.]

               “et habet tristis quoque turba cinaedos.”

          [“and the dull crowd also has its voluptuaries.” (or:)
          “an austere countenance sometimes covers a debauched [[mind]].”
           --idem.]

i am very much of plato’s [[opinion]], who says that facile or harsh humours
are [[great]] indications of the [[good]] or ill disposition of the [[mind]].
socrates had a constant countenance, but serene and smiling, not sourly
austere, like the elder crassus, whom no one ever saw laugh.  [[virtue]] is a
pleasant and [[gay]] quality.

i [[know]] very well that few will quarrel with the licence of my writings,
who have not more to quarrel with in the licence of their own thoughts [[thought]]:
i conform myself well enough to their inclinations, but i offend their
eyes.  ‘tis a fine [[humour]] to strain the writings of [[plato]], to wrest his
pretended intercourses with phaedo, dion, stella, and archeanassa:

               “non pudeat dicere, quod non pudet sentire.”

     [“let us not be ashamed to speak what we are not ashamed to [[think]].”]

i hate a froward and dismal spirit, that slips over all the pleasures [[pleasure]] of
life and seizes and feeds upon misfortunes; like flies, that cannot stick
to a smooth and polished [[body]], but fix and repose themselves upon craggy
and rough places, and like cupping-glasses, that only suck and attract
bad [[blood]].

as to the rest, i have enjoined myself to dare to say all that i dare to
do; even thoughts [[thought]] that are not to be published, displease me; the worst
of my actions and qualities do not appear to me so [[evil]] as i find it evil
and base not to dare to own them.  every one is wary and discreet in
confession, but [[men]] ought to be so in action; the boldness of doing ill
is in some sort compensated and restrained by the boldness of confessing
it.  whoever will oblige himself to tell all, should oblige himself to do
nothing that he must be forced to conceal.  i [[wish]] that this excessive
licence of mine may draw [[men]] to [[freedom]], above these timorous and mincing
virtues sprung from our imperfections, and that at the expense of my
immoderation i may reduce them to [[reason]].  a [[man]] must see and study his
vice to [[correct]] it; they who conceal it from others, commonly conceal it
from themselves; and do not [[think]] it close enough, if they themselves see
it: they withdraw and [[disguise]] it from their own consciences:

     “quare vitia sua nemo confitetur?  quia etiam nunc in
     illia est; somnium narrare vigilantis est.”

     [“why does no [[man]] confess his vices [[vice]]?  because he is yet in them;
     ‘tis for a waking [[man]] to tell his [[dream]].”--seneca, ep., 53.]

the diseases of the [[body]] explain themselves by their increase; we find
that to be the gout which we called a rheum or a strain; the diseases of
the [[soul]], the greater they are, keep, themselves the most obscure;
the most sick are the least sensible; therefore it is that with an
unrelenting hand they most often, in full day, be taken to task, opened,
and torn from the hollow of the [[heart]].  as in doing well, so in doing
ill, the mere [[confession]] is sometimes satisfaction.  is there any
deformity in doing amiss, that can excuse us from confessing ourselves?
it is so [[great]] a [[pain]] to me to dissemble, that i evade the trust of
another’s secrets, wanting the [[courage]] to disavow my [[knowledge]].  i can
keep silent, but deny i cannot without the [[greatest]] trouble and violence
to myself imaginable to be very secret, a [[man]] must be so by [[nature]], not
by obligation.  ‘tis little worth, in the service of a [[prince]], to be
secret, if a [[man]] be not a liar to boot.  if he who [[asked]] thales the
milesian whether he ought solemnly to deny that he had committed
adultery, had applied himself to me, i should have told him that he ought
not to do it; for i look upon lying as a worse [[fault]] than the other.
thales advised him quite contrary, bidding him swear to shield the
greater [[fault]] by the less;

     [montaigne’s memory here serves him ill, for the [[question]] being put
     to thales, his [[answer]] was: “but is not perjury worse than
     adultery?”--diogenes laertius, in vita, i. 36.]

nevertheless, this counsel was not so much an election as a
multiplication of [[vice]].  upon which let us say this in passing, that we
deal liberally with a [[man]] of [[conscience]] when we propose to him some
difficulty in counterpoise of [[vice]]; but when we shut him up betwixt two
vices, he is put to a hard [[choice]] as origen was either to idolatrise or
to suffer himself to be carnally abused by a [[great]] ethiopian [[slave]] they
brought to him.  he submitted to the first condition, and wrongly, people
say.  yet those [[women]] of our times [[time]] are not much out, according to their
error, who [[protest]] they had rather burden their consciences with ten men
than one mass.

if it be indiscretion so to publish one’s errors, yet there is no great
danger that it pass into [[example]] and custom; for ariston said,  that the
winds [[men]] most [[fear]] are those that lay them open.  we must tuck up this
ridiculous rag that hides our manners: they send their consciences to the
stews, and keep a starched countenance: even traitors and assassins
espouse the laws [[law]] of [[ceremony]], and there fix their [[duty]].  so that neither
can [[injustice]] [[complain]] of incivility, nor malice of indiscretion.  ‘tis
pity but a [[bad]] [[man]] should be a [[fool]] to boot, and that outward decency
should palliate his [[vice]]: this rough-cast only appertains to a [[good]] and
sound wall, that deserves to be preserved and whited.

in favour of the huguenots, who condemn our auricular and private
confession, i confess myself in [[public]], religiously and purely: st.
augustin, origeti, and hippocrates have published the errors of their
opinions; i, moreover, of my manners.  i am greedy of making myself
known, and i [[care]] not to how many, provided it be truly; or to say
better, i [[hunger]] for nothing; but i mortally hate to be mistaken by those
who happen to learn my name.  he who does all things for [[honour]] and
glory, what can he [[think]] to gain by shewing himself to the [[world]] in a
vizor, and by concealing his true being from the [[people]]?  [[praise]] a
humpback for his stature, he has [[reason]] to take it for an affront:
if you are a [[coward]], and [[men]] commend you for your valour, is it of you
they speak?  they take you for another.  i should like him as well who
glorifies himself in the compliments and congees that are made him as if
he were master of the company, when he is one of the least of the train.
archelaus, [[king]] of macedon, walking along the street, somebody threw
water on his head, which they who were with him said he ought to punish:
“aye, but,” said he, “whoever it was, he did not throw the water upon me,
but upon him whom he took me to be.”  [[socrates]] being told that people
spoke ill of him, “not at all,” said he, “there is nothing, in me of what
they say.”

for my part, if any one should recommend me as a [[good]] pilot, as being
very modest or very chaste, i should owe him no thanks; and so, whoever
should call me traitor, robber, or drunkard, i should be as little
concerned.  they who do not rightly [[know]] themselves, may feed themselves
with false approbations; not i, who see myself, and who examine myself
even to my very bowels, and who very well [[know]] what is my due.  i am
content to be less commended, provided i am [[better]] known.  i may be
reputed a [[wise]] [[man]] in such a sort of [[wisdom]] as i take to be folly.
i am vexed that my essays only serve the ladies [[lady]] for a [[common]] piece of
furniture, and a piece for the hall; this [[chapter]] will make me part of
the water-closet.  i [[love]] to traffic with them a little in private;
public conversation is without favour and without savour.  in farewells,
we oftener than not heat our affections towards the things we take leave
of; i take my [[last]] leave of the pleasures [[pleasure]] of this [[world]]: these are our
last embraces.

but let us come to my [[subject]]: what has the act of [[generation]], so
natural, so necessary, and so just, done to [[men]], to be a thing not to
be spoken of without blushing, and to be excluded from all serious and
moderate discourse?   we boldly pronounce kill, rob, betray, and that we
dare only to do betwixt the teeth.  is it to say, the less we expend in
words, we may [[pay]] so much the more in thinking?  for it is [[certain]] that
the words least in use, most seldom written, and [[best]] kept in, are the
best and most generally known: no [[age]], no manners, are ignorant of them,
no more than the word bread they imprint themselves in every one without
being, expressed, without voice, and without figure; and the [[sex]] that
most practises it is bound to say least of it.  ‘tis an act that we have
placed in the franchise of [[silence]], from which to take it is a crime even
to accuse and [[judge]] it; neither dare we reprehend it but by periphrasis
and picture.  a [[great]] favour to a [[criminal]] to be so execrable that
justice thinks [[think]] it [[unjust]] to touch and see him; [[free]], and safe by the
benefit of the severity of his condemnation.  is it not here as in matter
of books [[book]], that sell [[better]] and become more [[public]] for being suppressed?
for my part, i will take [[aristotle]] at his word, who says, that
“bashfulness is an ornament to [[youth]], but a reproach to old [[age]].”  these
verses are preached in the ancient school, a school that i much more
adhere to than the [[modern]]: its virtues [[virtue]] appear to me to be greater, and
the vices [[vice]] less:

              “ceux qui par trop fuyant [[venus]] estrivent,
               faillent autant que ceulx qui trop la suyvent.”

     [“they err as much who too much forbear [[venus]], as they who are too
     frequent in her rites.”--a translation by amyot from plutarch, a
     philosopher should converse with princes [[prince]].]

              “tu, dea, rerum naturam sola gubernas,
               nec sine to quicquam dias in luminis oras
               exoritur, neque fit laetum, nec amabile quidquam.”

     [“goddess, still thou alone governest [[nature]], nor without thee
     anything comes into [[light]]; nothing is pleasant, nothing joyful.”
      --lucretius, i. 22.]

i [[know]] not who could set pallas and the muses at variance with [[venus]], and
make them cold towards [[love]]; but i see no deities so well met, or that
are more indebted to one another.  who will deprive the muses of amorous
imaginations, will rob them of the [[best]] entertainment they have, and of
the noblest matter of their [[work]]: and who will make [[love]] lose the
communication and service of poesy, will disarm him of his [[best]] [[weapons]]:
by this means they charge the [[god]] of familiarity and [[good]] will, and the
protecting goddesses [[goddess]] of [[humanity]] and [[justice]], with the [[vice]] of
ingratitude and unthankfulness.  i have not been so long cashiered from
the [[state]] and service of this [[god]], that my memory is not still [[perfect]] in
his [[force]] and value:

               “agnosco veteris vestigia flammae;”

     [“i recognise vestiges of my old flame.”--aeneid., iv. 23.]

there are yet some remains of heat and emotion after the fever:

          “nec mihi deficiat calor hic, hiemantibus annis!”

     [“nor let this heat of [[youth]] fail me in my winter years.”]

withered and drooping as i am, i [[feel]] yet some remains of the past
ardour:

              “qual l’alto egeo, per the aquilone o noto
               cessi, the tutto prima il volse et scosse,
               non ‘s accheta ei pero; ma’l suono e’l moto
               ritien del l’onde anco agitate e grosse:”

          [“as aegean seas, when storms be calmed again,
          that rolled their tumbling waves with troublous blasts,
          do yet of tempests passed some show retain,
          and here and there their swelling billows cast.”--fairfax.]

but from what i [[understand]] of it, the [[force]] and [[power]] of this [[god]] are
more lively and animated in the picture of poesy than in their own
essence:

                    “et versus digitos habet:”

          [“verse has fingers.”--altered from juvenal, iv. 196.]

it has i [[know]] not what [[kind]] of air, more amorous than [[love]] itself.  venus
is not so beautiful, naked, alive, and panting, as she is here in [[virgil]]:

         “dixerat; et niveis hinc atque hinc diva lacertis
          cunctantem amplexu molli fovet.  ille repente
          accepit solitam flammam; notusque medullas
          intravit calor, et labefacta per ossa cucurrit
          non secus atque olim tonitru, cum rupta corusco
          ignea rima micans percurrit lumine nimbos.
          . . . . . .  ea verba loquutus,
          optatos dedit amplexus; placidumque petivit
          conjugis infusus gremio per membra soporem.”

     [“the [[goddess]] spoke, and throwing round him her snowy arms in soft
     embraces, caresses him hesitating.  suddenly he caught the wonted
     flame, and the well-known warmth pierced his marrow, and ran
     thrilling through his shaken bones: just as when at times [[time]], with
     thunder, a stream of [[fire]] in lightning flashes shoots across the
     skies [[sky]].  having spoken these words, he gave her the wished embrace,
     and in the bosom of his spouse sought placid sleep.”
      --aeneid, viii.  387 and 392.]

all that i find [[fault]] with in considering it is, that he has represented
her a little too passionate for a [[married]] [[venus]]; in this discreet [[kind]] of
coupling, the appetite is not usually so wanton, but more grave and dull.
love hates that [[people]] should hold of any but itself, and goes but
faintly to [[work]] in familiarities derived from any other title, as
marriage is: [[alliance]], dowry, therein sway by [[reason]], as much or more
than grace and [[beauty]].  [[men]] do not [[marry]] for themselves, let them say
what they will; they [[marry]] as much or more for their [[posterity]] and
family; the custom and interest of [[marriage]] concern our [[race]] much more
than us; and therefore it is, that i like to have a match carried on by a
third hand rather than a man’s own, and by another man’s liking than that
of the party himself; and how much is all this opposite to the
conventions of [[love]]?  and also it is a [[kind]] of incest to employ in this
venerable and [[sacred]] [[alliance]] the heat and extravagance of amorous
licence, as i [[think]] i have said elsewhere.  a [[man]], says [[aristotle]], must
approach his [[wife]] with prudence and temperance, lest in dealing too
lasciviously with her, the extreme [[pleasure]] make her exceed the bounds of
reason.  what he says upon the account of [[conscience]], the physicians say
upon the account of health: “that a [[pleasure]] excessively lascivious,
voluptuous, and frequent, makes the seed too hot, and hinders
conception”: ‘tis said, elsewhere, that to a languishing intercourse, as
this naturally is, to supply it with a due and fruitful heat, a [[man]] must
do it but seldom and at appreciable intervals:

          “quo rapiat sitiens venerem, interiusque recondat.”

     [“but let him thirstily snatch the joys of [[love]] and enclose them in
     his bosom.”--virg., georg., iii. 137.]

i see no marriages [[marriage]] where the conjugal compatibility sooner fails than
those that we contract upon the account of [[beauty]] and amorous desires [[desire]];
there should be more solid and constant foundation, and they should
proceed with greater circumspection; this furious ardour is worth
nothing.

they who [[think]] they [[honour]] [[marriage]] by joining [[love]] to it, do, methinks,
like those who, to favour [[virtue]], hold that nobility is nothing else but
virtue.  they are indeed things that have some relation to one another,
but there is a [[great]] deal of difference; we should not so mix their names
and titles; ‘tis a [[wrong]] to them both so to confound them.  nobility is a
brave quality, and with [[good]] [[reason]] introduced; but forasmuch as ‘tis a
quality depending upon others, and may happen in a vicious [[person]], in
himself nothing, ‘tis in estimate infinitely below virtue’;

     [“if nobility be [[virtue]], it loses its quality in all things wherein
     not [[virtuous]]: and if it be not [[virtue]], ‘tis a small matter.”
      --la byuyere.]

‘tis a [[virtue]], if it be one, that is artificial and apparent, depending
upon [[time]] and [[fortune]]: various in form, according to the [[country]]; living
and mortal; without birth, as the river nile; genealogical and [[common]];
of succession and similitude; drawn by consequence, and a very [[weak]] one.
knowledge, [[strength]], goodness, [[beauty]], riches [[rich]], and all other qualities,
fall into communication and commerce, but this is consummated in itself,
and of no use to the service of others.  there was proposed to one of our
kings the [[choice]] of two candidates for the same command, of whom one was
a gentleman, the other not; he ordered that, without [[respect]] to quality,
they should choose him who had the most [[merit]]; but where the worth of the
competitors should appear to be entirely [[equal]], they should have respect
to birth: this was justly to give it its rank.  a [[young]] [[man]] unknown,
coming to antigonus to make suit for his father’s command, a valiant man
lately [[dead]]: “friend,” said he, “in such preferments as these, i have not
so much regard to the nobility of my soldiers as to their prowess.”
 and, indeed, it ought not to go as it did with the officers of the kings
of sparta, trumpeters, fiddlers, cooks, the [[children]] of whom always
succeeded to their places, how ignorant soever, and were preferred before
the most experienced in the [[trade]].  they of calicut make of nobles [[noble]] a sort
of superhuman persons [[person]]: they are interdicted [[marriage]] and all but warlike
employments: they may have of concubines their fill, and the [[women]] as
many lovers, without being [[jealous]] of one another; but ‘tis a [[capital]] and
irremissible crime to couple with a [[person]] of meaner conditions than
themselves; and they [[think]] themselves polluted, if they have but touched
one in walking along; and supposing their nobility to be marvellously
interested and injured in it, kill such as only approach a little too
near them: insomuch that the ignoble are obliged to cry out as they walk,
like the gondoliers of venice, at the turnings of streets for [[fear]] of
jostling; and the nobles [[noble]] command them to step aside to what part they
please: by that means these avoid what they repute a perpetual ignominy,
those [[certain]] [[death]].  no [[time]], no favour of the [[prince]], no office, or
virtue, or riches [[rich]], can ever prevail to make a plebeian become [[noble]]: to
which this custom contributes, that marriages [[marriage]] are interdicted betwixt
different trades [[trade]]; the [[daughter]] of one of the cordwainers’ gild is not
permitted to [[marry]] a carpenter; and parents are obliged to train up their
children precisely in their own callings, and not put them to any other
trade; by which means the distinction and continuance of their fortunes
are maintained.

a [[good]] [[marriage]], if there be any such, rejects the company and conditions
of [[love]], and tries to represent those of [[friendship]].  ‘tis a sweet
society of [[life]], full of constancy, trust, and an infinite number of
useful and solid services and mutual obligations; which any woman who has
a [[right]] taste:

                    “optato quam junxit lumine taeda”--

     [“whom the [[marriage]] torch has joined with the [[desired]] [[light]].”
      --catullus, lxiv. 79.]

would be loth to serve her husband in quality of a mistress.  if she be
lodged in his affection as a [[wife]], she is more honourably and securely
placed.  when he purports to be in [[love]] with another, and works [[work]] all he
can to obtain his [[desire]], let any one but ask him, on which he had rather
a disgrace should fall, his [[wife]] or his mistress, which of their
misfortunes would most afflict him, and to which of them he wishes [[wish]] the
most grandeur, the [[answer]] to these questions [[question]] is out of dispute in a sound
marriage.

and that so few are observed to be [[happy]], is a token of its price and
value.  if well formed and rightly taken, ‘tis the [[best]] of all human
societies; we cannot [[live]] without it, and yet we do nothing but decry it.
it happens, as with cages, the birds without despair to get in, and those
within despair of getting out.  [[socrates]] being [[asked]], whether it was more
commodious to take a [[wife]] or not, “let a [[man]] take which course he will,”
 said he; “he will repent.”  ‘tis a contract to which the common
saying:

                    “homo homini aut deus aut lupus,”

          [“man to [[man]] is either a [[god]] or a wolf.”--erasmus, adag.]

may very fitly be applied; there must be a concurrence of many qualities
in the construction.  it is found nowadays more convenient for simple and
plebeian souls [[soul]], where delights, curiosity, and idleness do not so much
disturb it; but extravagant humours [[humour]], such as mine, that hate all sorts of
obligation and restraint, are not so proper for it:

               “et mihi dulce magis resoluto vivere collo.”

          [“and it is sweet to me to [[live]] with a loosened neck.”
           --pseudo gallus, i. 61.]

might i have had my own will, i would not have [[married]] [[wisdom]] herself, if
she would have had me.  but ‘tis to much [[purpose]] to evade it; the common
custom and usance of [[life]] will have it so.  the most of my actions are
guided by [[example]], not by [[choice]], and yet i did not go to it of my own
voluntary motion; i was [[led]] and drawn to it by extrinsic occasions [[occasion]]; for
not only things that are incommodious in themselves, but also things
however ugly, vicious, and to be avoided, may be rendered acceptable by
some condition or accident; so unsteady and [[vain]] is all [[human]] resolution!
and i was persuaded to it, when worse prepared and less tractable than i
am at [[present]], that i have tried what it is: and as [[great]] a libertine as
i am taken to be, i have in [[truth]] more strictly observed the laws [[law]] of
marriage, than i either promised or expected.  ‘tis in [[vain]] to kick, when
a [[man]] has once put on his fetters: a [[man]] must prudently manage his
liberty; but having once submitted to obligation, he must confine himself
within the laws [[law]] of [[common]] [[duty]], at least, do what he can towards it.
they who engage in this contract, with a design to carry themselves in it
with [[hatred]] and contempt, do an [[unjust]] and inconvenient thing; and the
fine [[rule]] that i hear pass from hand to hand amongst the [[women]], as a
sacred oracle:

     [“serve thy husband as thy master, but guard thyself against him as
     from a traitor.”]

which is to say, comport thyself towards him with a dissembled, inimical,
and distrustful reverence (a cry of [[war]] and defiance), is equally
injurious and hard.  i am too mild for such rugged designs: to say the
truth, i am not arrived to that [[perfection]] of ability and refinement of
wit, to confound [[reason]] with [[injustice]], and to laugh at all [[rule]] and
order that does not please my palate; because i hate superstition, i do
not presently run into the contrary extreme of irreligion.

     (if a [[man]] hate superstition he cannot [[love]] [[religion]].  d.w.)

if a [[man]] does not always perform his [[duty]], he ought at least to [[love]] and
acknowledge it; ‘tis treachery to [[marry]] without espousing.

let us proceed.

our poet represents a [[marriage]] [[happy]] in a [[good]] accord wherein
nevertheless there is not much loyalty.  does he mean, that it is not
impossible but a woman may give the reins to her own passion, and yield
to the importunities of [[love]], and yet reserve some [[duty]] toward [[marriage]],
and that it may be hurt, without being totally broken?  a serving [[man]] may
cheat his master, whom nevertheless he does not hate.  [[beauty]],
opportunity, and [[destiny]] (for [[destiny]] has also a hand in’t),

                         “fatum est in partibus illis
          quas sinus abscondit; nam, si tibi sidera cessent,
          nil faciet longi mensura incognita nervi;”

     [“there is a fatality about the hidden parts: let [[nature]] have
     endowed you however liberally, ‘tis of no use, if your [[good]] star
     fails you in the nick of [[time]].”--juvenal, ix. 32.]

have attached her to a stranger; though not so wholly, peradventure, but
that she may have some remains of [[kindness]] for her husband.  they are two
designs, that have several paths leading to them, without being
confounded with one another; a woman may yield to a [[man]] she would by no
means have [[married]], not only for the condition of his [[fortune]], but for
those also of his [[person]].  few [[men]] have made a [[wife]] of a mistress, who
have not repented it.  and even in the other [[world]], what an unhappy life
does [[jupiter]] lead with his, whom he had first enjoyed as a mistress!
‘tis, as the proverb runs, to befoul a basket and then put it upon one’s
head.  i have in my [[time]], in a [[good]] [[family]], seen [[love]] shamefully and
dishonestly cured by [[marriage]]: the considerations are widely different.
we [[love]] at once, without any tie, two things contrary in themselves.

socrates was wont to say, that the [[city]] of [[athens]] pleased, as ladies [[lady]] do
whom [[men]] court for [[love]]; every one loved to come thither to take a turn,
and pass away his [[time]]; but no one liked it so well as to espouse it,
that is, to inhabit there, and to make it his constant residence.  i have
been vexed to see husbands hate their wives [[wife]] only because they themselves
do them [[wrong]]; we should not, at all events, methinks, [[love]] them the less
for our own faults [[fault]]; they should at least, upon the account of repentance
and compassion, be dearer to us.

they are different ends, he says, and yet in some sort compatible;
marriage has utility, [[justice]], [[honour]], and constancy for its share;
a flat, but more universal [[pleasure]]: [[love]] founds itself wholly upon
pleasure, and, indeed, has it more full, lively, and sharp; a pleasure
inflamed by difficulty; there must be in it sting and smart: ‘tis no
longer [[love]], if without darts and [[fire]].  the bounty of ladies [[lady]] is too
profuse in [[marriage]], and dulls the point of affection and [[desire]]: to
evade which inconvenience, do but observe what pains [[pain]] lycurgus and plato
take in their laws [[law]].

women are not to blame at all, when they refuse the rules [[rule]] of [[life]] that
are introduced into the [[world]], forasmuch as the [[men]] make them without
their [[help]].  there is naturally contention and brawling betwixt them and
us; and the strictest [[friendship]] we have with them is yet mixed with
tumult and tempest.  in the [[opinion]] of our author, we deal
inconsiderately with them in this: after we have discovered that they
are, without comparison, more able and ardent in the practice of love
than we, and that the old [[priest]] testified as much, who had been one
while a [[man]], and then a woman:

                    “venus huic erat utraque nota:”

               [“both aspects of [[love]] were known to him,”
                --tiresias. ovid.  metam., iii. 323.]

and moreover, that we have learned from their own mouths the proof that,
in several ages [[age]], was made by an [[emperor]] and empress of [[rome]],--[proclus.]
--both famous for ability in that affair!  for he in one night deflowered
ten sarmatian virgins who were his captives: but she had five-and-twenty
bouts in one night, changing her [[man]] according to her need and liking;

                    “adhuc ardens rigidae tentigine vulvae
               et lassata viris, nondum satiata, recessit:”

          [“ardent still, she retired, fatigued, but not satisfied.”
           --juvenal, vi. 128.]

and that upon the dispute which happened in cataluna, wherein a wife
complaining of her husband’s too frequent addresses to her, not so much,
as i conceive, that she was incommodated by it (for i [[believe]] no miracles
out of religion) as under this pretence, to curtail and curb in this,
which is the fundamental act of [[marriage]], the [[authority]] of husbands over
their wives [[wife]], and to shew that their frowardness and malignity go beyond
the nuptial bed, and spurn under foot even the graces and sweets of
venus; the husband, a [[man]] truly brutish and unnatural, replied, that even
on fasting days he could not subsist with less than ten courses:
whereupon came out that notable sentence of the queen of arragon, by
which, after mature deliberation of her council, this [[good]] queen, to give
a [[rule]] and [[example]] to all succeeding ages [[age]] of the moderation required in
a just [[marriage]], set down six times [[time]] a day as a legitimate and necessary
stint; surrendering and quitting a [[great]] deal of the needs and desires [[desire]] of
her [[sex]], that she might, she said, establish an easy, and consequently, a
permanent and immutable [[rule]].  hereupon the doctors cry out: what must
the female appetite and concupiscence be, when their [[reason]], their
reformation and [[virtue]], are taxed at such a rate, considering the divers
judgments of our appetites?  for solon, master of the [[law]] school, taxes
us but at three a month,--that [[men]] may not fail in point of conjugal
frequentation: after having, i say, believed and preached all this, we go
and enjoin them continency for their particular share, and upon the last
and extreme penalties.

there is no passion so hard to contend with as this, which we would have
them only resist, not simply as an ordinary [[vice]], but as an execrable
abomination, worse than irreligion and parricide; whilst we, at the same
time, go to’t without offence or reproach.  even those amongst us who
have tried the experiment have sufficiently confessed what difficulty, or
rather impossibility, they have found by material remedies to subdue,
weaken, and cool the [[body]].  we, on the contrary, would have them at once
sound, vigorous plump, high-fed, and chaste; that is to say, both hot and
cold; for the [[marriage]], which we tell them is to keep them from burning,
is but small refreshment to them, as we order the matter.  if they take
one whose vigorous [[age]] is yet boiling, he will be proud to make it known
elsewhere;

                   “sit tandem pudor; aut eamus in jus;
                    multis mentula millibus redempta,
                    non est haec tua, basse; vendidisti;”

     [“let there be some shame, or we shall go to [[law]]: your vigour,
     bought by your [[wife]] with many thousands, is no longer yours: thou
     hast sold it.--“martial, xii. 90.]

polemon the philosopher was justly by his [[wife]] brought before the judge
for sowing in a barren field the seed that was due to one that was
fruitful:  if, on the other hand, they take a decayed fellow, they are in
a worse condition in [[marriage]] than either maids or widows.  we [[think]] them
well provided for, because they have a [[man]] to [[lie]] with, as the romans
concluded clodia laeta, a vestal nun, violated, because caligula had
approached her, though it was declared he did no more but approach her:
but, on the contrary, we by that increase their necessity, forasmuch as
the touch and company of any [[man]] whatever rouses their desires [[desire]], that in
solitude would be more quiet.  and to the end, ‘tis likely, that they
might render their chastity more meritorious by this circumstance and
consideration, boleslas and kinge his [[wife]], kings [[king]] of poland, vowed it by
mutual [[consent]], being in bed together, on their very wedding day, and
kept their vow in spite of all matrimonial conveniences.

we train them up from their infancy to the traffic of [[love]]; their grace,
dressing, [[knowledge]], [[language]], and whole instruction tend that way: their
governesses imprint nothing in them but the [[idea]] of [[love]], if for nothing
else but by continually representing it to them, to give them a distaste
for it.  my [[daughter]], the only child i have, is now of an [[age]] that
forward [[young]] [[women]] are allowed to be [[married]] at; she is of a slow, thin,
and tender [[complexion]], and has accordingly been brought up by her mother
after a retired and particular manner, so that she but now begins to be
weaned from her childish simplicity.  she was reading before me in a
french [[book]] where the word ‘fouteau’, the name of a tree very well known,
occurred;--[the beech-tree; the name resembles in sound an obscene
french word.]--the woman, to whose conduct she is committed, stopped her
short a little roughly, and made her skip over that dangerous step.  i
let her alone, not to trouble their rules [[rule]], for i never concern myself in
that sort of [[government]]; feminine polity has a mysterious procedure; we
must leave it to them; but if i am not mistaken the commerce of twenty
lacquies could not, in six months’ [[time]], have so imprinted in her memory
the meaning, usage, and all the consequence of the sound of these wicked
syllables, as this [[good]] old woman did by reprimand and interdiction.

                   “motus doceri gaudet ionicos
                    matura virgo, et frangitur artibus;
                    jam nunc et incestos amores
                    de tenero, meditatur ungui.”

     [“the maid ripe for [[marriage]] delights to learn ionic dances, and to
     imitate those lascivious movements.  nay, already from her infancy
     she meditates [[criminal]] amours.”--horace, od., iii.  6, 21., the text
     has ‘fingitur’.]

let them but give themselves the rein a little, let them but enter into
liberty of discourse, we are but [[children]] to them in this [[science]].  hear
them but describe our pursuits and conversation, they will very well make
you [[understand]] that we bring them nothing they have not known before, and
digested without our [[help]].

     [this sentence refers to a conversation between some [[young]] [[women]] in
     his immediate neighbourhood, which the essayist just below informs
     us that he overheard, and which was too shocking for him to repeat.
     it must have been tolerably [[bad]].--remark by the editor of a later
     edition.]

is it, perhaps, as [[plato]] says, that they have formerly been debauched
young fellows?  i happened one day to be in a place where i could hear
some of their talk without suspicion; i am [[sorry]] i cannot repeat it.
by’rlady, said i, we had need go study the phrases of amadis, and the
tales of boccaccio and aretin, to be able to discourse with them: we
employ our [[time]] to much [[purpose]] indeed.  there is neither word, [[example]],
nor step they are not more [[perfect]] in than our books [[book]]; ‘tis a discipline
that springs with their [[blood]],

                    “et mentem ipsa [[venus]] dedit,”

               [“venus herself made them what they are,”
                --virg., georg., iii. 267.]

which these [[good]] instructors, [[nature]], [[youth]], and health, are continually
inspiring them with; they need not learn, they breed it:

              “nec tantum niveo gavisa est ulla columbo,
               compar, vel si quid dicitur improbius,
               oscula mordenti semper decerpere rostro,
               quantum praecipue multivola est mulier.”

     [“no milk-white dove, or if there be a thing more lascivious,
     takes so much delight in kissing as woman, wishful for every man
     she sees.”--catullus, lxvi. 125.]

so that if the [[natural]] [[violence]] of their [[desire]] were not a little
restrained by [[fear]] and [[honour]], which were wisely contrived for them, we
should be all shamed.  all the motions in the [[world]] resolve into and tend
to this conjunction; ‘tis a matter infused throughout: ‘tis a centre to
which all things are directed.  we yet see the edicts of the old and wise
rome made for the service of [[love]], and the precepts of [[socrates]] for the
instruction of courtezans:

                   “noncon libelli stoici inter sericos
                    jacere pulvillos amant:”

          [“there are writings of the stoics which we find lying upon
          silken cushions.”--horace, epod., viii. 15.]

zeno, amongst his laws [[law]], also regulated the motions to be observed in
getting a maidenhead.  what was the philosopher strato’s [[book]] of carnal
conjunction?--[ diogenes laertius, v.  59.]--and what did theophrastus
treat of in those he intituled, the one ‘the lover’, and the other ‘of
love?’  of what aristippus in his ‘of former delights’?  what do the so
long and lively descriptions in [[plato]] of the loves [[love]] of his [[time]] pretend
to?  and the [[book]] called ‘the lover’, of demetrius phalereus? and
‘clinias’, or the ‘ravished lover’, of heraclides; and that of
antisthenes, ‘of getting children’, or, ‘of weddings’, and the other,
‘of the master or the lover’?  and that of aristo: ‘of amorous exercises’
what those of cleanthes: one, ‘of love’, the other, ‘of the art [[arts]] of
loving’?  the amorous dialogues of sphaereus? and the fable of jupiter
and juno, of chrysippus, impudent beyond all toleration?  and his fifty
so lascivious epistles?  i will let alone the writings of the
philosophers of the epicurean sect, protectress of voluptuousness.  fifty
deities were, in [[time]] [[past]], assigned to this office; and there have been
nations where, to assuage the [[lust]] of those who came to their devotion,
they kept [[men]] and [[women]] in their temples for the worshippers to [[lie]] with;
and it was an act of [[ceremony]] to do this before they went to prayers:

     “nimirum propter continentiam incontinentia necessaria est;
     incendium ignibus extinguitur.”

     [“forsooth incontinency is necessary for continency’s sake; a
     conflagration is extinguished by [[fire]].”]

in the [[greatest]] part of the [[world]], that member of our [[body]] was deified;
in the same province, some flayed off the skin to offer and consecrate a
piece; others offered and consecrated their seed.  in another, the young
men publicly cut through betwixt the skin and the flesh of that part in
several places, and thrust pieces of wood into the openings as long and
thick as they would receive, and of these pieces of wood afterwards made
a [[fire]] as an offering to their gods; and were reputed neither vigorous
nor chaste, if by the [[force]] of that cruel [[pain]] they seemed to be at all
dismayed.  elsewhere the most [[sacred]] magistrate was reverenced and
acknowledged by that member and in several ceremonies [[ceremony]] the effigy of it
was carried in pomp to the [[honour]] of various divinities.  the egyptian
ladies, in their bacchanalia, each carried one finely-carved of wood
about their necks, as large and heavy as she could so carry it; besides
which, the statue of their [[god]] presented one, which in greatness
surpassed all the rest of his [[body]].--[herodotus, ii.  48, says “nearly
as large as the [[body]] itself.”]--the [[married]] [[women]], near the place where
i [[live]], make of their kerchiefs the figure of one upon their foreheads,
to glorify themselves in the enjoyment they have of it; and coming to be
widows, they throw it behind, and cover it with their headcloths.  the
most modest matrons of [[rome]] [[thought]] it an [[honour]] to offer flowers and
garlands to the [[god]] priapus; and they made the virgins, at the [[time]] of
their espousals, sit upon his shameful parts.  and i [[know]] not whether i
have not in my [[time]] seen some air of like devotion.  what was the meaning
of that ridiculous piece of the chaussuye of our forefathers, and that is
still worn by our swiss? [“cod-pieces worn”--cotton]--to what end do we
make a show of our implements in figure under our breeches, and often,
which is worse, above their [[natural]] size, by falsehood and imposture?
i have half a [[mind]] to [[believe]] that this sort of vestment was [[invented]] in
the [[better]] and more conscientious ages [[age]], that the [[world]] might not be
deceived, and that every one should give a [[public]] account of his
proportions: the simple nations wear them yet, and near about the real
size.  in those days, the tailor took measure of it, as the shoemaker
does now of a man’s foot.  that [[good]] [[man]], who, when i was [[young]], gelded
so many [[noble]] and ancient statues in his [[great]] [[city]], that they might not
corrupt the sight of the ladies [[lady]], according to the [[advice]] of this other
ancient worthy:

          “flagitii principium est, nudare inter gives corpora,”

     [“‘tis the beginning of wickedness to expose their persons [[person]] among the
     citizens”--ennius, ap. cicero, tusc. quaes., iv. 33.]

should have called to [[mind]], that, as in the mysteries of the bona dea,
all masculine appearance was excluded, he did nothing, if he did not geld
horses and asses, in short, all [[nature]]:

         “omne adeo genus in terris, hominumque, ferarumque,
          et genus aequoreum, pecudes, pictaeque volucres,
          in furias ignemque ruunt.”

          [“so that all living things, [[men]] and animals, wild or tame,
          and fish and gaudy fowl, rush to this flame of [[love]].”
           --virgil, georg., iii. 244.]

the gods, says [[plato]], have given us one disobedient and unruly member
that, like a furious animal, attempts, by the [[violence]] of its appetite,
to [[subject]] all things to it; and so they have given to [[women]] one like a
greedy and ravenous animal, which, if it be refused food in season, grows
wild, impatient of delay, and infusing its rage into their bodies [[body]], stops
the passages, and hinders respiration, causing a thousand ills, till,
having imbibed the fruit of the [[common]] thirst, it has plentifully bedewed
the bottom of their matrix.  now my legislator--[the [[pope]] who, as
montaigne has told us, took it into his head to geld the statues.]--
should also have considered that, peradventure, it were a chaster and
more fruitful usage to let them [[know]] the [[fact]] as it is betimes, than
permit them to guess according to the [[liberty]] and heat of their own
fancy; instead of the real parts they substitute, through [[hope]] and
desire, others that are three times [[time]] more extravagant; and a certain
friend of mine lost himself by producing his in place and [[time]] when the
opportunity was not [[present]] to put them to their more serious use.  what
mischief do not those pictures of prodigious dimension do that the boys
make upon the staircases and galleries of the [[royal]] houses? they give the
ladies a cruel contempt of our [[natural]] furniture.  and what do we know
but that [[plato]], after other well-instituted republics [[republic]], ordered that the
men and [[women]], old and [[young]], should expose themselves naked to the view
of one another, in his gymnastic exercises, upon that very account?  the
indian [[women]] who see the [[men]] in their [[natural]] [[state]], have at least cooled
the sense of seeing.  and let the [[women]] of the [[kingdom]] of pegu say what
they will, who below the waist have nothing to cover them but a cloth
slit before, and so strait, that what decency and modesty soever they
pretend by it, at every step all is to be seen, that it is an invention
to allure the [[men]] to them, and to divert them from boys, to whom that
nation is generally inclined; yet, peradventure they lose more by it than
they get, and one may venture to say, that an entire appetite is more
sharp than one already half-glutted by the [[eyes]].  livia was wont to say,
that to a [[virtuous]] woman a naked [[man]] was but a statue.  the lacedaemonian
women, more virgins when wives [[wife]] than our daughters [[daughter]] are, saw every day the
young [[men]] of their [[city]] stripped naked in their exercises, themselves
little heeding to cover their thighs in walking, believing themselves,
says [[plato]], sufficiently covered by their [[virtue]] without any other robe.
but those, of whom st. augustin speaks, have given nudity a wonderful
power of temptation, who have made it a [[doubt]], whether [[women]] at the day
of [[judgment]] shall rise again in their own [[sex]], and not rather in ours,
for [[fear]] of tempting us again in that holy [[state]].  in brief, we allure
and flesh them by all sorts of ways: we incessantly heat and stir up
their [[imagination]], and then we find [[fault]].  let us confess the [[truth]];
there is scarce one of us who does not more apprehend the shame that
accrues to him by the vices [[vice]] of his [[wife]] than by his own, and that is not
more solicitous (a wonderful charity) of the [[conscience]] of his virtuous
wife than of his own; who had not rather commit theft and sacrilege, and
that his [[wife]] was a murderess and a heretic, than that she should not be
more chaste than her husband: an [[unjust]] estimate of vices [[vice]].  both we and
they are capable of a thousand corruptions more prejudicial and unnatural
than [[lust]]: but we weigh vices [[vice]], not according to [[nature]], but according to
our interest; by which means they take so many unequal forms.

the austerity of our decrees renders the application of [[women]] to this
vice more [[violent]] and vicious than its own condition needs, and engages
it in consequences worse than their cause: they will readily offer to go
to the [[law]] courts to seek for gain, and to the wars [[war]] to get [[reputation]],
rather than in the midst of ease and delights, to have to keep so
difficult a guard.  do not they very well see that there is neither
merchant nor soldier who will not leave his [[business]] to run after this
sport, or the porter or cobbler, toiled and tired out as they are with
labour and [[hunger]]?

                   “num tu, qux tenuit dives achaemenes,
                    aut pinguis phrygiae mygdonias opes,
                    permutare velis crine licymnim?
                    plenas aut arabum domos,
                    dum fragrantia detorquet ad oscula
                    cervicem, aut facili sxvitia negat,
                    quae poscente magis gaudeat eripi,
                    interdum rapere occupet?”

     [“wouldst thou not exchange all that the wealthy arhaemenes had,
     or the mygdonian riches [[rich]] of fertile phrygia, for one ringlet of
     licymnia’s hair?  or the treasures of the arabians, when she turns
     her head to you for fragrant kisses, or with easily assuaged anger
     denies them, which she would rather by far you took by [[force]], and
     sometimes herself snatches one!”--horace, od., ii. 12, 21.]

i do not [[know]] whether the exploits of alexander and caesar really surpass
the resolution of a beautiful [[young]] woman, bred up after our [[fashion]], in
the [[light]] and commerce of the [[world]], assailed by so many contrary
examples, and yet keeping herself entire in the midst of a thousand
continual and powerful solicitations.  there is no doing more difficult
than that not doing, nor more active:

i hold it more easy to carry a suit of armour all the days of one’s life
than a maidenhead; and the vow of virginity of all others is the most
noble, as being the hardest to keep:

               “diaboli virtus in lumbis est,”

says st.  jerome.  we have, doubtless, resigned to the ladies [[lady]] the most
difficult and most vigorous of all [[human]] endeavours, and let us resign to
them the [[glory]] too.  this ought to encourage them to be obstinate in it;
‘tis a brave thing for them to defy us, and to spurn under foot that vain
pre-eminence of valour and [[virtue]] that we pretend to have over them; they
will find if they do but observe it, that they will not only be much more
esteemed for it, but also much more beloved.  a gallant [[man]] does not give
over his pursuit for being refused, provided it be a refusal of chastity,
and not of [[choice]]; we may swear, threaten, and [[complain]] to much [[purpose]];
we therein do but [[lie]], for we [[love]] them all the [[better]]: there is no
allurement like modesty, if it be not rude and crabbed.  ‘tis stupidity
and meanness to be obstinate against [[hatred]] and disdain; but against a
virtuous and constant resolution, mixed with goodwill, ‘tis the exercise
of a [[noble]] and generous [[soul]].  they may acknowledge our service to a
certain [[degree]], and give us civilly to [[understand]] that they disdain us
not; for the [[law]] that enjoins them to abominate us because we adore them,
and to hate us because we [[love]] them, is certainly very cruel, if but for
the difficulty of it.  why should they not give ear to our offers and
requests, so long as they are kept within the bounds of modesty?
wherefore should we fancy them to have other thoughts [[thought]] within, and to be
worse than they seem?  a queen of our [[time]] said with spirit, “that to
refuse these courtesies is a testimony of weakness in [[women]] and a
self-accusation of facility, and that a [[lady]] could not boast of her
chastity who was never tempted.”

the limits of [[honour]] are not cut so short; they may give themselves a
little rein, and relax a little without being faulty: there lies [[lie]] on the
frontier some space [[free]], indifferent, and neuter.  he that has beaten
and pursued her into her fort is a [[strange]] fellow if he be not satisfied
with his [[fortune]]: the price of the [[conquest]] is considered by the
difficulty.  would you [[know]] what impression your service and [[merit]] have
made in her [[heart]]?  [[judge]] of it by her behaviour.  such an one may grant
more, who does not grant so much.  the obligation of a benefit wholly
relates to the [[good]] will of those who confer it: the other coincident
circumstances are dumb, [[dead]], and casual; it costs her dearer to grant
you that little, than it would do her companion to grant all.  if in
anything rarity give estimation, it ought especially in this: do not
consider how little it is that is given, but how few have it to give;
the value of [[money]] alters according to the coinage and stamp of the
place.  whatever the spite and indiscretion of some may make them say in
the excess of their discontent, [[virtue]] and [[truth]] will in [[time]] recover all
the advantage.  i have known some whose [[reputation]] has for a [[great]] while
suffered under slander, who have afterwards been restored to the world’s
universal approbation by their mere constancy without [[care]] or artifice;
every one repents, and gives himself the [[lie]] for what he has believed and
said; and from girls a little suspected they have been afterward advanced
to the first rank amongst the ladies [[lady]] of [[honour]].  somebody told [[plato]] that
all the [[world]] spoke ill of him.  “let them talk,” said he; “i will live
so as to make them [[change]] their note.”  besides the [[fear]] of [[god]], and the
value of so rare a [[glory]], which ought to make them look to themselves,
the [[corruption]] of the [[age]] we [[live]] in compels them to it; and if i were
they, there is nothing i would not rather do than intrust my reputation
in so dangerous hands.  in my [[time]] the [[pleasure]] of telling (a pleasure
little inferior to that of doing) was not permitted but to those who had
some faithful and only friend; but now the ordinary discourse and common
table-talk is nothing but boasts of favours received and the secret
liberality of ladies [[lady]].  in earnest, ‘tis too abject, too much meanness of
spirit, in [[men]] to suffer such ungrateful, indiscreet, and giddy-headed
people so to [[persecute]], forage, and rifle those tender and charming
favours.

this our immoderate and illegitimate exasperation against this vice
springs from the most [[vain]] and turbulent disease that afflicts human
minds, which is [[jealousy]]:

              “quis vetat apposito lumen de lumine sumi?
               dent licet assidue, nil tamen inde perit;”

     [“who says that one [[light]] should not be lighted from another [[light]]?
     let them give ever so much, as much ever remains to lose.”--ovid, de
     arte amandi, iii. 93.  the measure of the [[last]] line is not [[good]];
     but the words are taken from the epigram in the catalecta entitled
     priapus.]

she, and envy, her sister, seem to me to be the most foolish of the whole
troop.  as to the [[last]], i can say little about it; ‘tis a passion that,
though said to be so mighty and powerful, had never to do with me.  as to
the other, i [[know]] it by sight, and that’s all.  beasts [[feel]] it; the
shepherd cratis, having fallen in [[love]] with a she-goat, the he-goat, out
of [[jealousy]], came, as he lay asleep, to butt the head of the female, and
crushed it.  we have raised this fever to a greater excess by the
examples of some barbarous nations; the [[best]] disciplined have been
touched with it, and ‘tis [[reason]], but not transported:

              “ense maritali nemo confossus adulter
               purpureo stygias sanguine tinxit aquas.”

               [“never did adulterer slain by a husband
               stain with purple [[blood]] the stygian waters.”]

lucullus, caesar, pompey, antony, cato, and other brave [[men]] were
cuckolds, and knew it, without making any bustle about it; there was in
those days but one coxcomb, lepidus, that died for [[grief]] that his wife
had used him so.

              “ah! tum te miserum malique fati,
               quem attractis pedibus, patente porta,
               percurrent raphanique mugilesque:”

     [“wretched man!  when, taken in the [[fact]], thou wilt be
     dragged out of doors by the heels, and suffer the punishment
     of thy adultery.”--catullus, xv. 17.]

and the [[god]] of our poet, when he surprised one of his companions with his
wife, satisfied himself by putting them to shame only,

               “atque aliquis de dis non tristibus optat
               sic fieri turpis:”

          [“and one of the merry gods wishes [[wish]] that he should himself
          like to be so disgraced.”--ovid, metam., iv. 187.]

and nevertheless took anger at the lukewarm embraces she gave him;
complaining that upon that account she was grown [[jealous]] of his
affection:

               “quid causas petis ex alto? fiducia cessit
               quo tibi, diva, mei?”

     [“dost thou seek causes from above?  why, [[goddess]], has your
     confidence in me ceased?”--virgil, aeneid, viii. 395.]

nay, she entreats arms for a bastard of hers,

                    “arena rogo genitrix nato.”

          [“i, a [[mother]], ask armour for a [[son]].”--idem, ibid., 383.]

which are freely granted; and vulcan speaks honourably of [[aeneas]],

                    “arma acri facienda viro,”

     [“arms are to be made for a valiant hero.”--aeneid, viii. 441.]

with, in [[truth]], a more than [[human]] [[humanity]].  and i am willing to leave
this excess of [[kindness]] to the gods:

               “nec divis homines componier aequum est.”

          [“nor is it fit to compare [[men]] with gods.”
           --catullus, lxviii. 141.]

as to the confusion of [[children]], besides that the gravest legislators
ordain and affect it in their republics [[republic]], it touches not the [[women]], where
this passion is, i [[know]] not how, much [[better]] seated:

               “saepe etiam juno, maxima coelicolam,
               conjugis in culpa flagravit quotidiana.”

     [“often was juno, [[greatest]] of the heaven-dwellers, enraged by her
     husband’s daily infidelities.”--idem, ibid.]

when [[jealousy]] seizes these [[poor]] souls [[soul]], [[weak]] and incapable of [[resistance]],
‘tis [[pity]] to see how miserably it torments and tyrannises over them; it
insinuates itself into them under the title of [[friendship]], but after it
has once possessed them, the same causes that served for a foundation of
good-will serve them for a foundation of mortal [[hatred]].  ‘tis, of all the
diseases of the [[mind]], that which the most things serve for aliment and
the fewest for remedy: the [[virtue]], health, [[merit]], [[reputation]] of the
husband are incendiaries of their fury and ill-will:

          “nullae sunt inimicitiae, nisi amoris, acerbae.”

          [“no enmities are bitter, save that of [[love]].”
           (or:) “no hate is implacable except the [[hatred]] of love”
           --propertius, ii. 8, 3.]

this fever defaces and corrupts all they have of beautiful and good
besides; and there is no action of a [[jealous]] woman, let her be how chaste
and how [[good]] a housewife soever, that does not relish of anger and
wrangling; ‘tis a furious agitation, that rebounds them to an extremity
quite contrary to its cause.  this held [[good]] with one octavius at [[rome]].
having lain with pontia posthumia, he augmented [[love]] with fruition, and
solicited with all importunity to [[marry]] her: unable to persuade her, this
excessive affection precipitated him to the effects of the most cruel and
mortal [[hatred]]: he killed her.  in like manner, the ordinary symptoms of
this other amorous disease are intestine hatreds, private conspiracies,
and cabals:

               “notumque furens quid faemina possit,”

     [“and it is known what an angry woman is capable of doing.”
      --aeneid, v. 21.]

and a rage which so much the more frets itself, as it is compelled to
excuse itself by a pretence of good-will.

now, the [[duty]] of chastity is of a vast extent; is it the will that we
would have them restrain?  this is a very supple and active thing; a
thing very nimble, to be stayed.  how? if dreams [[dream]] sometimes engage them so
far that they cannot deny them: it is not in them, nor, peradventure, in
chastity itself, seeing that is a female, to defend itself from [[lust]] and
desire.  if we are only to trust to their will, what a case are we in,
then?  do but imagine what crowding there would be amongst [[men]] in
pursuance of the [[privilege]] to run full speed, without tongue or [[eyes]],
into every woman’s arms who would accept them.  the scythian [[women]] put
out the [[eyes]] of all their slaves [[slave]] and prisoners [[prisoner]] of [[war]], that they might
have their [[pleasure]] of them, and they never the wiser.  o, the furious
advantage of opportunity!  should any one ask me, what was the first
thing to be considered in [[love]] matters, i should [[answer]] that it was how
to take a fitting [[time]]; and so the second; and so the third--‘tis a point
that can do everything.  i have sometimes wanted [[fortune]], but i have also
sometimes been wanting to myself in matters of attempt.  [[god]] [[help]] him,
who yet makes [[light]] of this!  there is greater temerity required in this
age of ours, which our [[young]] [[men]] excuse under the name of heat; but
should [[women]] examine it more strictly, they would find that it rather
proceeds from contempt.  i was always superstitiously afraid of giving
offence, and have ever had a [[great]] [[respect]] for her i loved: besides, he
who in this traffic takes away the reverence, defaces at the same time
the lustre.  i would in this affair have a [[man]] a little play the child,
the timorous, and the servant.  if not this, i have in other bashfulness
whereof altogether in things some air of the foolish plutarch makes
mention; and the course of my [[life]] has been divers ways hurt and
blemished with it; a quality very ill suiting my universal form: and,
indeed, what are we but sedition and discrepancy?  i am as much out of
countenance to be denied as i am to deny; and it so much troubles me to
be troublesome to others that on [[occasion]] when [[duty]] compels me to try the
good-will of any one in a thing that is doubtful and that will be
chargeable to him, i do it very faintly, and very much against my will:
but if it be for my own particular (whatever [[homer]] truly says, that
modesty is a foolish [[virtue]] in an indigent person), i commonly commit it
to a third [[person]] to blush for me, and deny those who employ me with the
same difficulty: so that it has sometimes befallen me to have had a mind
to deny, when i had not the [[power]] to do it.

‘tis folly, then, to attempt to bridle in [[women]] a [[desire]] that is so
powerful in them, and so [[natural]] to them.  and when i hear them brag of
having so maidenly and so temperate a will, i laugh at them: they retire
too far back.  if it be an old toothless trot, or a [[young]] dry consumptive
thing, though it be not altogether to be believed, at least they say it
with more similitude of [[truth]].  but they who still move and breathe, talk
at that ridiculous rate to their own prejudice, by [[reason]] that
inconsiderate excuses are a [[kind]] of self-accusation; like a gentleman, a
neighbour of mine, suspected to be insufficient:

              “languidior tenera cui pendens sicula beta,
               numquam se mediam sustulit ad tunicam,”

          [catullus, lxvii. 2, i.--the sense is in the context.]

who three or four days after he was [[married]], to justify himself, went
about boldly swearing that he had ridden twenty stages the night before:
an oath that was afterwards made use of to convict him of his ignorance
in that affair, and to divorce him from his [[wife]].  besides, it signifies
nothing, for there is neither continency nor [[virtue]] where there are no
opposing desires [[desire]].  it is true, they may say, but we will not yield;
saints themselves speak after that manner.  i mean those who boast in
good gravity of their coldness and insensibility, and who expect to be
believed with a serious countenance; for when ‘tis spoken with an
affected look, when their [[eyes]] give the [[lie]] to their tongue, and when
they talk in the cant of their profession, which always goes against the
hair, ‘tis [[good]] [[sport]].  i am a [[great]] servant of [[liberty]] and plainness;
but there is no remedy; if it be not wholly simple or childish, ‘tis
silly, and unbecoming ladies [[lady]] in this commerce, and presently runs into
impudence.  their disguises and figures only serve to cosen fools [[fool]]; lying
is there in its seat of [[honour]]; ‘tis a by-way, that by a back-door leads
us to [[truth]].  if we cannot curb their [[imagination]], what would we have
from them.  effects?  there are enough of them that evade all foreign
communication, by which chastity may be corrupted:

               “illud saepe facit, quod sine teste facit;”

          [“he often does that which he does without a witness.”
           --martial, vii. 62, 6.]

and those which we [[fear]] the least are, peradventure, most to be feared;
their sins [[sin]] that make the least noise are the worst:

               “offendor maecha simpliciore minus.”

          [“i am less offended with a more professed strumpet.”
           --idem, vi. 7,6.]

there are ways by which they may lose their virginity without
prostitution, and, which is more, without their [[knowledge]]:

     “obsterix, virginis cujusdam integritatem manu velut explorans, sive
     malevolentia, sive inscitia, sive casu, dum inspicit, perdidit.”

     [“by malevolence, or unskilfulness, or accident, the midwife,
     seeking with the hand to test some maiden’s virginity, has sometimes
     destroyed it.”--st. augustine, de civit. dei, i. 18.]

such a one, by seeking her maidenhead, has lost it; another by playing
with it has destroyed it.  we cannot precisely circumscribe the actions,
we interdict them; they must guess at our meaning under general and
doubtful terms; the very [[idea]] we invent for their chastity is ridiculous:
for, amongst the [[greatest]] patterns that i have is fatua, the [[wife]] of
faunus: who never, after her [[marriage]], [[suffered]] herself to be seen by any
man whatever; and the [[wife]] of hiero, who never perceived her husband’s
stinking breath, imagining that it was [[common]] to all [[men]].  they must
become insensible and invisible to satisfy us.

now let us confess that the knot of this [[judgment]] of [[duty]] principally
lies in the will; there have been husbands who have [[suffered]] cuckoldom,
not only without reproach or taking offence at their wives [[wife]], but with
singular obligation to them and [[great]] commendation of their [[virtue]].
such a woman has been, who prized her [[honour]] above her [[life]], and yet has
prostituted it to the furious [[lust]] of a mortal [[enemy]], to save her
husband’s [[life]], and who, in so doing, did that for him she would not have
done for herself!  this is not the place wherein we are to multiply these
examples; they are too high and [[rich]] to be set off with so [[poor]] a foil as
i can give them here; let us reserve them for a nobler place; but for
examples of ordinary lustre, do we not every day see [[women]] amongst us who
surrender themselves for their husbands sole benefit, and by their
express order and mediation? and, of old, phaulius the argian, who
offered his to [[king]] philip out of [[ambition]]; as galba did it out of
civility, who, having entertained maecenas at supper, and observing that
his [[wife]] and he began to cast glances at one another and to make [[eyes]] and
signs, let himself sink down upon his cushion, like one in a profound
sleep, to give opportunity to their desires [[desire]]: which he handsomely
confessed, for thereupon a servant having made bold to lay hands on the
plate upon the table, he frankly cried, “what, you rogue? do you not see
that i only sleep for maecenas?” such there may be, whose manners may be
lewd enough, whose will may be more reformed than another, who outwardly
carries herself after a more regular manner.  as we see some who complain
of having vowed chastity before they knew what they did; and i have also
known others really, [[complain]] of having been given up to debauchery
before they were of the years of discretion.  the [[vice]] of the parents or
the impulse of [[nature]], which is a rough counsellor, may be the cause.

in the east indies, though chastity is of singular [[reputation]], yet custom
permitted a [[married]] woman to prostitute herself to any one who presented
her with an elephant, and that with [[glory]], to have been valued at so high
a rate.  phaedo the philosopher, a [[man]] of birth, after the taking of his
country elis, made it his [[trade]] to prostitute the [[beauty]] of his [[youth]], so
long as it lasted, to any one that would, for [[money]] thereby to gain his
living: and solon was the first in greece, ‘tis said, who by his laws
gave [[liberty]] to [[women]], at the expense of their chastity, to provide for
the necessities of [[life]]; a custom that herodotus says had been received
in many governments [[government]] before his [[time]].  and besides, what fruit is there of
this painful solicitude?  for what [[justice]] soever there is in this
passion, we are yet to consider whether it turns to account or no: does
any one [[think]] to curb them, with all his industry?

         “pone seram; cohibe: sed quis custodiet ipsos
          custodes?  cauta est, et ab illis incipit uxor.”

     [“put on a lock; shut them up under a guard; but who shall guard
     the guard?  she knows [[know]] what she is about, and begins with them.”
      --juvenal, vi. 346.]

what commodity will not serve their turn, in so knowing an [[age]]?

curiosity is vicious throughout; but ‘tis pernicious here.  ‘tis folly to
examine into a disease for which there is no physic that does not inflame
and make it worse; of which the shame grows still greater and more public
by [[jealousy]], and of which the [[revenge]] more wounds our [[children]] than it
heals us.  you wither and [[die]] in the search of so obscure a proof.  how
miserably have they of my [[time]] arrived at that [[knowledge]] who have been so
unhappy as to have found it out?  if the informer does not at the same
time apply a remedy and bring relief, ‘tis an injurious information, and
that [[better]] deserves a stab than the [[lie]].  we no less laugh at him who
takes pains [[pain]] to prevent it, than at him who is a cuckold and knows [[know]] it not.
the [[character]] of cuckold is indelible: who once has it carries it to his
grave; the [[punishment]] proclaims it more than the [[fault]].  it is to much
purpose to drag out of obscurity and [[doubt]] our private misfortunes,
thence to expose them on tragic scaffolds; and misfortunes that only hurt
us by being known; for we say a [[good]] [[wife]] or a [[happy]] [[marriage]], not that
they are really so, but because no one says to the contrary.  [[men]] should
be so discreet as to evade this tormenting and unprofitable [[knowledge]]:
and the romans had a custom, when returning from any expedition, to send
home before to acquaint their wives [[wife]] with their coming, that they might
not surprise them; and to this [[purpose]] it is that a [[certain]] nation has
introduced a custom, that the [[priest]] shall on the wedding-day open the
way to the bride, to [[free]] the husband from the [[doubt]] and curiosity of
examining in the first assault, whether she comes a virgin to his bed, or
has been at the [[trade]] before.

but the [[world]] will be talking.  i [[know]], a hundred honest [[men]] cuckolds,
honestly and not unbeseemingly; a worthy [[man]] is pitied, not disesteemed
for it.  order it so that your [[virtue]] may conquer your misfortune; that
good [[men]] may curse the [[occasion]], and that he who wrongs [[wrong]] you may tremble
but to [[think]] on’t.  and, moreover, who escapes being talked of at the
same rate, from the least even to the [[greatest]]?

                    “tot qui legionibus imperitivit
          et melior quam to multis fuit, improbe, rebus.”

     [“many who have commanded legions, many a [[man]] much [[better]] far than
     you, you rascal.”--lucretius, iii. 1039, 1041.]

seest thou how many honest [[men]] are reproached with this in thy presence;
believe that thou art [[arts]] no more spared elsewhere.  but, the very ladies
will be laughing too; and what are they so apt to laugh at in this
virtuous [[age]] of ours as at a peaceable and well-composed [[marriage]]?  each
amongst you has made somebody cuckold; and [[nature]] runs much in parallel,
in compensation, and turn for turn.  the frequency of this accident ought
long since to have made it more easy; ‘tis now passed into custom.

miserable passion! which has this also, that it is incommunicable,

          “fors etiam nostris invidit questibus aures;”

          [“fortune also refuses ear to our complaints.”
           --catullus, lxvii.]

for to what friend dare you intrust your griefs, who, if he does not
laugh at them, will not make use of the [[occasion]] to get a share of the
quarry?  the sharps, as well as the sweets of [[marriage]], are kept secret
by the [[wise]]; and amongst its other troublesome conditions this to a
prating fellow, as i am, is one of the [[chief]], that custom has rendered it
indecent and prejudicial to communicate to any one all that a [[man]] knows
and all that a [[man]] feels [[feel]].  to give [[women]] the same counsel against
jealousy would be so much [[time]] lost; their very being is so made up of
suspicion, vanity, and curiosity, that to cure them by any legitimate way
is not to be hoped.  they often recover of this infirmity by a form of
health much more to be feared than the disease itself; for as there are
enchantments that cannot take away the [[evil]] but by throwing it upon
another, they also willingly transfer this ever to their husbands, when
they shake it off themselves.  and yet i [[know]] not, to speak [[truth]],
whether a [[man]] can suffer worse from them than their [[jealousy]]; ‘tis the
most dangerous of all their conditions, as the head is of all their
members.  pittacus used to say,--[plutarch, on contentment, c. ii.]--
that every one had his trouble, and that his was the [[jealous]] head of his
wife; but for which he should [[think]] himself perfectly [[happy]].  a mighty
inconvenience, sure, which could poison the whole [[life]] of so just, so
wise, and so valiant a [[man]]; what must we other little fellows do?  the
senate of marseilles had [[reason]] to grant him his request who begged leave
to kill himself that he might be delivered from the clamour of his [[wife]];
for ‘tis a mischief that is never removed but by removing the whole
piece; and that has no remedy but flight or patience, though both of them
very hard.  he was, methinks, an understanding fellow who said, ‘twas a
happy [[marriage]] betwixt a blind [[wife]] and a deaf husband.

let us also consider whether the [[great]] and [[violent]] severity of obligation
we enjoin them does not [[produce]] two effects contrary to our design
namely, whether it does not render the pursuants more eager to attack,
and the [[women]] more easy to yield.  for as to the first, by raising the
value of the place, we raise the value and the [[desire]] of the [[conquest]].
might it not be [[venus]] herself, who so cunningly enhanced the price of her
merchandise, by making the laws [[law]] her bawds; knowing how insipid a delight
it would be that was not heightened by fancy and hardness to achieve?
in short, ‘tis all swine’s flesh, varied by sauces, as flaminius’ host
said.  cupid is a roguish [[god]], who makes it his [[sport]] to contend with
devotion and [[justice]]: ‘tis his [[glory]] that his [[power]] mates all powers [[power]], and
that all other rules [[rule]] give place to his:

               “materiam culpae prosequiturque suae.”

               [“and seeks out a matter (motive) for his crimes.”
                --ovid, trist., iv. i. 34.]

as to the second point; should we not be less cuckolds, if we less feared
to be so? according to the [[humour]] of [[women]] whom interdiction incites, and
who are more eager, being forbidden:

              “ubi velis, nolunt; ubi nolis, volunt ultro;
               concessa pudet ire via.”

     [“where thou wilt, they won’t; where thou wilt not, they
     spontaneously agree; they are ashamed to go in the permitted path.”
      --terence, eunuchus, act iv., sc. 8, v  43]

what [[better]] interpretation can we make of messalina’s behaviour?  she,
at first, made her husband a cuckold in private, as is the [[common]] use;
but, bringing her [[business]] about with too much ease, by [[reason]] of her
husband’s stupidity, she soon scorned that way, and presently fell to
making open [[love]], to own her lovers, and to favour and entertain them in
the sight of all: she would make him [[know]] and see how she used him.  this
animal, not to be roused with all this, and rendering her pleasures [[pleasure]] dull
and flat by his too stupid facility, by which he seemed to authorise and
make them lawful; what does she?  being the [[wife]] of a living and
healthful [[emperor]], and at [[rome]], the theatre of the [[world]], in the face of
the sun, and with solemn [[ceremony]], and to silius, who had long before
enjoyed her, she publicly marries herself one day that her husband was
gone out of the [[city]].  does it not seem as if she was going to become
chaste by her husband’s negligence? or that she sought another husband
who might sharpen her appetite by his [[jealousy]], and who by watching
should incite her?  but the first difficulty she met with was also the
last: this beast suddenly roused these sleepy, sluggish sort of [[men]] are
often the most dangerous: i have found by [[experience]] that this extreme
toleration, when it comes to dissolve, produces [[produce]] the most severe [[revenge]];
for taking [[fire]] on a sudden, anger and fury being combined in one,
discharge their utmost [[force]] at the first onset,

               “irarumque omnes effundit habenas:”

          [“he let loose his whole  fury.”--aeneid, xii. 499.]

he put her to [[death]], and with her a [[great]] number of those with whom she
had [[intelligence]], and even one of them who could not [[help]] it, and whom
she had caused to be forced to her bed with scourges.

what [[virgil]] says of [[venus]] and vulcan, lucretius had [[better]] expressed of a
stolen enjoyment betwixt her and [[mars]]:

              “belli fera moenera mavors
               armipotens regit, ingremium qui saepe tuum se
               rejictt, aeterno devinctus vulnere amoris
                    ............................
               pascit amore avidos inhians in te, dea, visus,
               eque tuo pendet resupini spiritus ore
               hunc tu, diva, tuo recubantem corpore sancto
               circumfusa super, suaveis ex ore loquelas
               funde.”

     [“mars, the [[god]] of wars [[war]], who controls the cruel tasks of [[war]], often
     reclines on thy bosom, and greedily drinks [[love]] at both his [[eyes]],
     vanquished by the eternal wound of [[love]]: and his breath, as he
     reclines, hangs on thy lips; bending thy head over him as he lies
     upon thy [[sacred]] [[person]], pour forth sweet and persuasive words.”
      --lucretius, i. 23.]

when i consider this rejicit, fiascit, inhians, ynolli, fovet, medullas,
labefacta, pendet, percurrit, and that [[noble]] circumfusa, [[mother]] of the
pretty infuses; i disdain those little quibbles and verbal allusions that
have since sprung up.  those worthy [[people]] stood in need of no subtlety
to [[disguise]] their meaning; their [[language]] is downright, and full of
natural and continued vigour; they are all epigram; not only the tail,
but the head, [[body]], and feet.  there is nothing forced, nothing
languishing, but everything keeps the same pace:

     “contextus totes virilis est; non sunt circa flosculos occupati.”

     [“the whole contexture is manly; they don’t occupy themselves with
     little flowers of rhetoric.”--seneca, ep., 33.]

‘tis not a soft eloquence, and without offence only; ‘tis nervous and
solid, that does not so much please, as it fills and ravishes the
greatest minds [[mind]].  when i see these brave forms of expression, so lively,
so profound, i do not say that ‘tis well said, but well [[thought]].  ‘tis
the sprightliness of the [[imagination]] that swells and elevates the words:

                    “pectus est quod disertum tacit.”

          [“the [[heart]] makes the [[man]] eloquent.”--quintilian, x. 7.]

our [[people]] call [[language]], [[judgment]], and fine words, full conceptions.
this painting is not so much carried on by dexterity of hand as by having
the object more vividly imprinted in the [[soul]].  gallus speaks simply
because he conceives simply: horace does not content himself with a
superficial expression; that would betray him; he sees farther and more
clearly into things; his [[mind]] breaks into and rummages all the magazine
of words and figures wherewith to express himself, and he must have them
more than ordinary, because his conception is so.  plutarch says’ that he
sees the latin tongue by the things: ‘tis here the same: the sense
illuminates and produces [[produce]] the words, no more words of air, but of flesh
and bone; they signify more than they say.  moreover, those who are not
well skilled in a [[language]] [[present]] some image of this; for in [[italy]] i
said whatever i had a [[mind]] to in [[common]] discourse, but in more serious
talk, i durst not have trusted myself with an idiom that i could not wind
and turn out of its ordinary pace; i would have a [[power]] of introducing
something of my own.

the handling and utterance of fine wits is that which sets off [[language]];
not so much by innovating it, as by putting it to more vigorous and
various services, and by straining, bending, and adapting it to them.
they do not create words, but they enrich their own, and give them weight
and signification by the uses they put them to, and [[teach]] them unwonted
motions, but withal ingeniously and discreetly.  and how little this
talent is given to all is manifest by the many french scribblers of this
age: they are bold and proud enough not to [[follow]] the [[common]] road, but
want of invention and discretion ruins them; there is nothing seen in
their writings but a wretched affectation of a [[strange]] new style, with
cold and absurd disguises, which, instead of elevating, depress the
matter: provided they can but trick themselves out with new words, they
care not what they signify; and to bring in a new word by the head and
shoulders, they leave the old one, very often more sinewy and significant
than the other.

there is stuff enough in our [[language]], but there is a defect in cutting
out: for there is nothing that might not be made out of our terms of
hunting and [[war]], which is a fruitful soil to borrow from; and forms of
speaking, like herbs, improve and grow stronger by being transplanted.
i find it sufficiently abundant, but not sufficiently pliable and
vigorous; it commonly quails under a powerful conception; if you would
maintain the [[dignity]] of your style, you will often perceive it to flag
and languish under you, and there latin steps in to its relief, as greek
does to others.  of some of these words i have just picked out we do not
so easily discern the energy, by [[reason]] that the frequent use of them has
in some sort abased their [[beauty]], and rendered it [[common]]; as in our
ordinary [[language]] there are many excellent phrases and metaphors to be
met with, of which the [[beauty]] is withered by [[age]], and the colour is
sullied by too [[common]] handling; but that nothing lessens the relish to an
understanding [[man]], nor does it derogate from the [[glory]] of those ancient
authors who, ‘tis likely, first brought those words into that lustre.

the sciences [[science]] treat of things too refinedly, after an artificial, very
different from the [[common]] and [[natural]], way.  my page makes [[love]], and
understands it; but [[read]] to him leo hebraeus--[leo the jew, ficinus,
cardinal bembo, and mario equicola all wrote treatises on [[love]].]--
and ficinus, where they speak of [[love]], its thoughts [[thought]] and actions, he
understands it not.  i do not find in [[aristotle]] most of my ordinary
motions; they are there covered and disguised in another robe for the use
of the schools.  [[good]] speed them! were i of the [[trade]], i would as much
naturalise art [[arts]] as they artificialise [[nature]].  let us let bembo and
equicola alone.

when i write, i can very well spare both the company and the remembrance
of books [[book]], lest they should interrupt my [[progress]]; and also, in [[truth]], the
best authors too much humble and discourage me: i am very much of the
painter’s [[mind]], who, having represented cocks most wretchedly ill,
charged all his boys not to suffer any [[natural]] cock to come into his
shop; and had rather need to give myself a little lustre, of the
invention of antigenides the musician, who, when he was [[asked]] to sing or
play, took [[care]] beforehand that the auditory should, either before or
after, be satiated with some other ill musicians.  but i can hardly be
without plutarch; he is so universal and so full, that upon all
occasions, and what extravagant [[subject]] soever you take in hand, he will
still be at your elbow, and hold out to you a liberal and not to be
exhausted hand of riches [[rich]] and embellishments.  it vexes me that he is so
exposed to be the spoil of those who are conversant with him: i can
scarce cast an eye upon him but i purloin either a leg or a wing.

and also for this design of mine ‘tis convenient for me for me to write
at [[home]], in a wild [[country]], where i have nobody to assist or relieve me;
where i hardly see a [[man]] who understands the latin of his paternoster,
and of french a little less.  i might have made it [[better]] elsewhere, but
then the [[work]] would have been less my own; and its principal end and
perfection is to be exactly mine.  i readily [[correct]] an accidental error,
of which i am full, as i run carelessly on; but for my ordinary and
constant imperfections, it were a [[kind]] of [[treason]] to put them out.  when
another tells me, or that i say to myself, “thou art [[arts]] too thick of
figures: this is a word of rough gascon: that is a dangerous phrase (i do
not reject any of those that are used in the [[common]] streets of [[france]];
they who would [[fight]] custom with grammar are triflers): this is an
ignorant discourse: this is a paradoxical discourse: that is going too
far: thou makest thyself too merry at times [[time]]: [[men]] will [[think]] thou sayest a
thing in [[good]] earnest which thou only speakest in jest.”--“yes, i [[know]],
but i [[correct]] the faults [[fault]] of inadvertence, not those of custom.  do i not
talk at the same rate throughout?  do i not represent myself to the [[life]]?
‘tis enough that i have done what i designed; all the [[world]] knows [[know]] me in
my [[book]], and my [[book]] in me.”

now i have an apish, imitative quality: when i used to write verses (and
i never made any but latin), they evidently discovered the poet i had
last [[read]], and some of my first essays have a little exotic taste: i
speak something another [[kind]] of [[language]] at [[paris]] than i do at montaigne.
whoever i steadfastly look upon easily leaves some impression of his upon
me; whatever i consider i usurp, whether a foolish countenance, a
disagreeable look, or a ridiculous way of speaking; and vices [[vice]] most of
all, because they seize and stick to me, and will not leave hold without
shaking.  i swear more by imitation than by [[complexion]]: a murderous
imitation, like that of the apes so terrible both in stature and
strength, that alexander met with in a [[certain]] [[country]] of the indies, and
which he would have had much ado any other way to have subdued; but they
afforded him the means by that inclination of theirs to imitate whatever
they saw done; for by that the hunters were taught to put on shoes in
their sight, and to tie them fast with many knots, and to muffle up their
heads in caps all composed of running nooses, and to seem to anoint their
eyes with glue; so did those [[poor]] beasts employ their imitation to their
own ruin they glued up their own [[eyes]], haltered and bound themselves.
the other faculty of playing the mimic, and ingeniously acting the words
and gestures of another, purposely to make [[people]] merry and to raise
their admiration, is no more in me than in a stock.  when i swear my own
oath, ‘tis only, by god! of all oaths the most direct.  they say that
socrates swore by the dog; zeno had for his oath the same interjection at
this [[time]] in use amongst the italians, cappari!  pythagoras swore by
water and air.  i am so apt, without thinking of it, to receive these
superficial impressions, that if i have majesty or highness in my mouth
three days together, they come out instead of excellency and lordship
eight days after; and what i say to-day in [[sport]] and fooling i shall say
the same to-morrow seriously.  wherefore, in writing, i more unwillingly
undertake beaten arguments, lest i should handle them at another’s
expense.  every [[subject]] is equally fertile to me: a fly will serve the
purpose, and ‘tis well if this i have in hand has not been undertaken at
the recommendation of as flighty a will.  i may begin, with that which
pleases me [[best]], for the subjects [[subject]] are all linked to one another.

but my [[soul]] displeases me, in that it ordinarily produces [[produce]] its deepest and
most airy conceits and which please me [[best]], when i least expect or study
for them, and which suddenly vanish, having at the instant, nothing to
apply them to; on horseback, at table, and in bed: but most on horseback,
where i am most given to [[think]].  my speaking is a little nicely jealous
of [[silence]] and attention: if i am talking my [[best]], whoever interrupts me,
stops me.  in travelling, the necessity of the way will often put a stop
to discourse; besides which i, for the most part, travel without company
fit for regular discourses, by which means i have all the leisure i would
to entertain myself.  it falls out as it does in my dreams [[dream]]; whilst
dreaming i recommend them to my memory (for i am apt to [[dream]] that i
dream), but, the next morning, i may represent to myself of what
complexion they were, whether [[gay]], or [[sad]], or [[strange]], but what they
were, as to the rest, the more i endeavour to retrieve them, the deeper i
plunge them in oblivion.  so of thoughts [[thought]] that come accidentally into my
head, i have no more but a [[vain]] image remaining in my memory; only enough
to make me torment myself in their quest to no [[purpose]].

well, then, laying books [[book]] aside, and more simply and materially speaking,
i find, after all, that [[love]] is nothing else but the thirst of enjoying
the object [[desired]], or [[venus]] any other thing than the [[pleasure]] of
discharging one’s vessels, just as the [[pleasure]] [[nature]] gives in
discharging other parts, that either by immoderation or indiscretion
become vicious.  according to [[socrates]], [[love]] is the appetite of
generation by the mediation of [[beauty]].  and when i consider the
ridiculous titillation of this [[pleasure]], the absurd, crack-brained, wild
motions with which it inspires zeno and cratippus, the indiscreet rage,
the countenance inflamed with fury and [[cruelty]] in the sweetest effects of
love, and then that austere air, so grave, severe, ecstatic, in so wanton
an action; that our delights and our excrements are promiscuously
shuffled together; and that the supreme [[pleasure]] brings along with it, as
in [[pain]], fainting and complaining; i [[believe]] it to be true, as plato
says, that the gods made [[man]] for their [[sport]]:

                        “quaenam ista jocandi
                         saevitia!”

     [“with a sportive cruelty” (or:) “what an unkindness there is in
     jesting!”--claudian in eutrop. i. 24.]

and that it was in mockery that [[nature]] has ordered the most agitative of
actions and the most [[common]], to make us [[equal]], and to put fools [[fool]] and wise
men, beasts and us, on a level.  even the most contemplative and prudent
man, when i imagine him in this posture, i hold him an impudent fellow to
pretend to be prudent and contemplative; they are the peacocks’ feet that
abate his [[pride]]:

                         “ridentem dicere verum
                         quid vetat?”

          [“what prevents us from speaking [[truth]] with a smile?”
           --horace, sat., i. i, 24.]

they who banish serious imaginations [[imagination]] from their sports [[sport]], do, says one,
like him who dares not adore the statue of a saint, if not covered with a
veil.  we [[eat]] and drink, indeed, as beasts do; but these are not actions
that obstruct the functions of the [[soul]], in these we maintain our
advantage over them; this other action subjects [[subject]] all other [[thought]],
and by its imperious [[authority]] makes an ass of all plato’s divinity and
philosophy; and yet there is no complaint of it.  in everything else a
man may keep some decorum, all other operations submit to the rules [[rule]] of
decency; this cannot so much as in [[imagination]] appear other than vicious
or ridiculous: find out, if you can, therein any serious and discreet
procedure.  alexander said, that he chiefly knew himself to be mortal by
this act and sleeping; sleep suffocates and suppresses the faculties of
the [[soul]]; the familiarity with [[women]] likewise dissipates and exhausts
them: doubtless ‘tis a mark, not only of our original [[corruption]], but
also of our vanity and deformity.

on the one side, [[nature]] pushes us on to it, having fixed the most [[noble]],
useful, and pleasant of all her functions to this [[desire]]: and, on the
other side, leaves us to accuse and avoid it, as insolent and indecent,
to blush at it, and to recommend abstinence.  are we not brutes to call
that [[work]] brutish which begets us?  [[people]] of so many differing religions
have concurred in several proprieties, as sacrifices [[sacrifice]], lamps, burning
incense, fasts, and offerings; and amongst others, in the condemning this
act: all opinions [[opinion]] tend that way, besides the widespread custom of
circumcision, which may be regarded as a [[punishment]].  we have,
peradventure, [[reason]] to blame ourselves for being guilty of so foolish
a production as [[man]], and to call the act, and the parts that are employed
in the act, shameful (mine, truly, are now shameful and pitiful).  the
essenians, of whom pliny speaks, kept up their [[country]] for several ages
without either nurse or baby-clouts, by the arrival of strangers who,
following this pretty [[humour]], came continually to them: a whole nation
being resolute, rather to hazard a total extermination, than to engage
themselves in female embraces, and rather to lose the succession of [[men]],
than to beget one.  ‘tis said, that zeno never had to do with a woman but
once in his [[life]], and then out of civility, that he might not seem too
obstinately to disdain the [[sex]].

     [diogenes laertius, vii. 13.--what is there said, however, is that
     zeno seldom had commerce with boys, lest he should be deemed a very
     misogynist.]

every one avoids seeing a [[man]] born, every one runs to see him [[die]]; to
destroy him a spacious field is sought out in the face of the sun, but,
to make him, we creep into as dark and private a corner as we can: ‘tis a
man’s [[duty]] to withdraw himself bashfully from the [[light]] to create; but
‘tis [[glory]] and the fountain of many virtues [[virtue]] to [[know]] how to [[destroy]] what
we have made: the one is injury, the other favour: for [[aristotle]] says
that to do any one a [[kindness]], in a [[certain]] phrase of his [[country]], is to
kill him.  the athenians, to couple the disgrace of these two actions,
having to purge the isle of delos, and to justify themselves to [[apollo]],
interdicted at once all births and burials in the precincts thereof:

                         “nostri nosmet paenitet.”

          [“we are ashamed of ourselves.”--terence, phoymio, i. 3, 20.]

there are some nations that will not be seen to [[eat]].  i [[know]] a [[lady]], and
of the [[best]] quality, who has the same [[opinion]], that chewing disfigures
the face, and takes away much from the ladies’ grace and [[beauty]]; and
therefore unwillingly appears at a [[public]] table with an appetite; and i
know a [[man]] also, who cannot endure to see another [[eat]], nor himself to be
seen eating, and who is more shy of company when putting in than when
putting out.  in the turkish [[empire]], there are a [[great]] number of [[men]] who,
to excel others, never suffer themselves to be seen when they make their
repast: who never have any more than one a week; who cut and mangle their
faces and limbs; who never speak to any one: fanatic [[people]] who [[think]] to
honour their [[nature]] by disnaturing themselves; who value themselves upon
their contempt of themselves, and purport to grow [[better]] by being worse.
what monstrous animal is this, that is a [[horror]] to himself, to whom his
delights are grievous, and who weds himself to misfortune?  there are
people who conceal their [[life]]:

               “exilioque domos et dulcia limina mutant,”

     [“and [[change]] for [[exile]] their homes [[home]] and pleasant abodes.”
      --virgil, georg., ii. 511.]

and withdraw them from the sight of other [[men]]; who avoid health and
cheerfulness, as dangerous and prejudicial qualities.  not only many
sects, but many peoples [[people]], curse their birth, and bless their [[death]]; and
there is a place where the sun is abominated and darkness adored.  we are
only ingenious in using ourselves ill: ‘tis the real quarry our
intellects fly at; and [[intellect]], when misapplied, is a dangerous tool!

               “o miseri! quorum gaudia crimen habent!”

          [“o wretched [[men]], whose pleasures [[pleasure]] are a crime!”
           --pseudo gallus, i. 180.]

alas, [[poor]] man!  thou hast enough inconveniences that are inevitable,
without increasing them by throe own invention; and art [[arts]] miserable enough
by [[nature]], without being so by art [[arts]]; thou hast real and essential
deformities enough, without forging those that are imaginary.  dost thou
think thou art [[arts]] too much at ease unless half thy ease is uneasy?  dost
thou find that thou hast not performed all the necessary offices that
nature has enjoined thee, and that she is idle in thee, if thou dost not
oblige thyself to other and new offices?  thou dost not stick to infringe
her universal and undoubted laws [[law]]; but stickest to thy own special and
fantastic rules [[rule]], and by how much more particular, uncertain, and
contradictory they are, by so much thou employest thy whole endeavour in
them: the laws [[law]] of thy parish occupy and bind thee: those of [[god]] and the
world concern thee not.  run but a little over the examples [[example]] of this [[kind]];
thy [[life]] is full of them.

whilst the verses of these two poets, treat so reservedly and discreetly
of wantonness as they do, methinks they discover it much more openly.
ladies cover their necks with network, priests [[priest]] cover several sacred
things, and painters shadow their pictures to give them greater lustre:
and ‘tis said that the sun and wind strike more violently by reflection
than in a direct line.  the egyptian wisely answered him who [[asked]] him
what he had under his cloak, “it is hid under my cloak,” said he, “that
thou mayest not [[know]] what it is:” but there are [[certain]] other things that
people hide only to show them.  hear that one, who speaks plainer,

               “et nudum pressi corpus ad usque meum:”

          [“and pressed her naked [[body]] to mine” (or:) “my body
          i applied even to her naked side”--ovid, amor., i. 5, 24.]

methinks that he emasculates me.  let martial turn up [[venus]] as high as he
may, he cannot shew her so naked: he who says all that is to be said
gluts and disgusts us.  he who is afraid to express himself, draws us on
to guess at more than is meant; there is treachery in this sort of
modesty, and specially when they half open, as these do, so [[fair]] a path
to [[imagination]].  both the action and description should relish of theft.

the more respectful, more timorous, more coy, and secret [[love]] of the
spaniards and italians pleases me.  i [[know]] not who of old wished his
throat as long as that of a crane, that he might the longer taste what he
swallowed; it had been [[better]] wished as to this quick and precipitous
pleasure, especially in such natures [[nature]] as mine that have the [[fault]] of being
too prompt.  to stay its flight and delay it with preambles: all things
--a glance, a bow, a word, a sign, stand for favour and recompense betwixt
them.  were it not an excellent piece of thrift in him who could dine on
the steam of the roast?  ‘tis a passion that mixes with very little solid
essence, far more vanity and feverish raving; and we should serve and pay
it accordingly.  let us [[teach]] the ladies [[lady]] to set a [[better]] value and esteem
upon themselves, to amuse and [[fool]] us: we give the [[last]] charge at the
first onset; the french impetuosity will still show itself; by spinning
out their favours, and exposing them in small parcels, even miserable old
age itself will find some little share of [[reward]], according to its worth
and [[merit]].  he who has no fruition but in fruition, who wins nothing
unless he sweeps the stakes, who takes no [[pleasure]] in the chase but in
the quarry, ought not to introduce himself in our school: the more steps
and degrees [[degree]] there are, so much higher and more honourable is the
uppermost seat: we should take a [[pleasure]] in being conducted to it, as in
magnificent palaces, by various porticoes and passages, long and pleasant
galleries, and many windings.  this disposition of things would turn to
our advantage; we should there longer stay and longer [[love]]; without hope
and without [[desire]] we proceed not worth a pin.  our [[conquest]] and entire
possession is what they ought infinitely to dread: when they wholly
surrender themselves up to the [[mercy]] of our fidelity and constancy they
run a mighty hazard; they are virtues [[virtue]] very rare and hard to be found; the
ladies are no sooner ours, than we are no more theirs:

              “postquam cupidae mentis satiata libido est,
               verba nihil metuere, nihil perjuria curant;”

          [“when our desires [[desire]] are once satisfied, we [[care]] little
          for oaths and promises.”--catullus, lxiv.  147.]

and thrasonides, a [[young]] [[man]] of greece, was so in [[love]] with his passion
that, having, gained a mistress’s [[consent]], he refused to enjoy her, that
he might not by fruition quench and stupefy the unquiet ardour of which
he was so proud, and with which he so fed himself.  dearness is a good
sauce to meat: do but observe how much the manner of salutation,
particular to our nation, has, by its facilities, made kisses, which
socrates says are so powerful and dangerous for the stealing of hearts [[heart]],
of no esteem.  it is a displeasing custom and injurious for the ladies [[lady]],
that they must be obliged to lend their lips to every fellow who has
three footmen at his heels, however ill-favoured he may be in himself:

                   “cujus livida naribus caninis
                    dependet glacies, rigetque barba .  .  .
                    centum occurrere malo culilingis:”
                     martial, vii. 94.

and we ourselves barely gain by it; for as the [[world]] is divided, for
three beautiful [[women]] we must kiss fifty ugly ones; and to a tender
stomach, like those of my [[age]], an ill kiss overpays a [[good]] one.

in [[italy]] they passionately court even their [[common]] [[women]] who sell
themselves for [[money]], and justify the doing so by saying, “that there are
degrees of fruition, and that by such service they would procure for
themselves that which is most entire; the [[women]] sell nothing but their
bodies; the will is too [[free]] and too much of its own to be exposed to
sale.”  so that these say, ‘tis the will they undertake and they have
reason.  ‘tis indeed the will that we are to serve and gain by wooing.
i abhor to imagine mine, a [[body]] without affection: and this madness is,
methinks, cousin-german to that of the boy who would needs pollute the
beautiful statue of [[venus]] made by praxiteles; or that of the furious
egyptian, who violated the [[dead]] carcase of a woman he was embalming:
which was the [[occasion]] of the [[law]] then made in [[egypt]], that the corpses of
beautiful [[young]] [[women]], of those of [[good]] quality, should be kept three
days before they should be delivered to those whose office it was to take
care for the interment.  periander did more wonderfully, who extended his
conjugal affection (more regular and legitimate) to the enjoyment of his
wife melissa after she was [[dead]].  does it not seem a lunatic [[humour]] in
the moon, seeing she could no otherwise enjoy her darling endymion, to
lay-him for several months asleep, and to please herself with the
fruition of a boy who stirred not but in his sleep?  i likewise say that
we [[love]] a [[body]] without a [[soul]] or sentiment when we [[love]] a [[body]] without
its [[consent]] and [[desire]].  all enjoyments are not alike: there are some
that are hectic and languishing: a thousand other causes besides
good-will may procure us this favour from the ladies [[lady]]; this is not a
sufficient testimony of affection: treachery may lurk there, as well as
elsewhere: they sometimes go to’t by halves:

              “tanquam thura merumque parent
               absentem marmoreamve putes:”

     [“as if they are preparing frankincense and wine .  .  . you might
     [[think]] her absent or marble.”--martial, xi. 103, 12, and 59, 8.]

i [[know]] some who had rather lend that than their coach, and who only
impart themselves that way.  you are to examine whether your company
pleases them upon any other account, or, as some strong-chined groom,
for that only; in what [[degree]] of favour and esteem you are with them:

                              “tibi si datur uni,
                    quem lapide illa diem candidiore notat.”

     [“wherefore that is enough, if that day alone is given us which she
     marks with a whiter stone.”--catullus, lxviii. 147.]

what if they [[eat]] your bread with the sauce of a more pleasing
imagination.

               “te tenet, absentes alios suspirat amores.”

               [“she has you in her arms; her thoughts [[thought]] are with
               other absent lovers.”--tibullus, i. 6, 35.]

what? have we not seen one in these days of ours who made use of this act
for the [[purpose]] of a most horrid [[revenge]], by that means to kill and
poison, as he did, a worthy [[lady]]?

such as [[know]] [[italy]] will not [[think]] it [[strange]] if, for this [[subject]], i seek
not elsewhere for examples [[example]]; for that nation may be called the regent of
the [[world]] in this.  they have more generally handsome and fewer ugly
women than we; but for rare and excellent beauties [[beauty]] we have as many as
they.  i [[think]] the same of their intellects: of those of the [[common]] sort,
they have evidently far more brutishness is immeasurably rarer there;
but in [[individual]] characters [[character]] of the highest form, we are nothing indebted
to them.  if i should carry on the comparison, i might say, as touching
valour, that, on the contrary, it is, to what it is with them, [[common]] and
natural with us; but sometimes we see them possessed of it to such a
degree as surpasses the [[greatest]] examples [[example]] we can [[produce]]: the marriages
of that [[country]] are defective in this; their custom commonly imposes so
rude and so slavish a [[law]] upon the [[women]], that the most distant
acquaintance with a stranger is as [[capital]] an offence as the most
intimate; so that all approaches being rendered necessarily substantial,
and seeing that all comes to one account, they have no hard [[choice]] to
make; and when they have broken down the fence, we may safely presume
they get on [[fire]]:

          “luxuria ipsis vinculis, sicut fera bestia,
          irritata, deinde emissa.”

     [“lust, like a wild beast, being more excited by being bound,
     breaks from his chains with greater wildness.”--livy, xxxiv. 4.]

they must give them a little more rein:

         “vidi ego nuper equum, contra sua frena tenacem,
          ore reluctanti fulminis ire modo”:

     [“i saw, the other day, a horse struggling against his bit,
     rush like a thunderbolt.”--ovid, amor., iii. 4, 13.]

the [[desire]] of company is allayed by giving it a little [[liberty]].  we are
pretty much in the same case they are extreme in constraint, we in
licence.  ‘tis a [[good]] custom we have in [[france]] that our sons [[son]] are received
into the [[best]] families [[family]], there to be entertained and bred up pages, as in
a school of nobility; and ‘tis looked upon as a discourtesy and an
affront to refuse this to a gentleman.  i have taken notice (for, so many
families, so many differing forms) that the ladies [[lady]] who have been
strictest with their maids have had no [[better]] [[luck]] than those who allowed
them a greater [[liberty]].  there should be moderation in these things; one
must leave a [[great]] deal of their conduct to their own discretion; for,
when all comes to all, no discipline can curb them throughout.  but it is
true withal that she who comes off with flying colours from a school of
liberty, brings with her whereon to repose more confidence than she who
comes away sound from a severe and strict school.

our fathers [[father]] dressed up their daughters’ looks in bashfulness and fear
(their [[courage]] and desires [[desire]] being the same); we ours in confidence and
assurance; we [[understand]] nothing of the matter; we must leave it to the
sarmatian [[women]], who may not [[lie]] with a [[man]] till with their own hands
they have first killed another in [[battle]].  for me, who have no other
title left me to these things but by the ears, ‘tis sufficient if,
according to the [[privilege]] of my [[age]], they retain me for one of their
counsel. i advise them then, and us [[men]] too, to abstinence; but if the
age we [[live]] in will not endure it, at least modesty and discretion.  for,
as in the story of aristippus, who, speaking to some [[young]] [[men]] who
blushed to see him go into a scandalous house, said “the [[vice]] is in not
coming out, not in going in,” let her who has no [[care]] of her conscience
have yet some regard to her [[reputation]]; and though she be rotten within,
let her carry a [[fair]] outside at least.

i commend a gradation and delay in bestowing their favours: plato
‘declares that, in all sorts of [[love]], facility and promptness are
forbidden to the defendant.  ‘tis a sign of eagerness which they
ought to [[disguise]] with all the art [[arts]] they have, so rashly, wholly, and
hand-over-hand to [[surrender]] themselves.  in carrying themselves orderly
and measuredly in the granting their [[last]] favours, they much more allure
our desires [[desire]] and hide their own.  let them still fly before us, even those
who have most [[mind]] to be overtaken: they [[better]] conquer us by flying, as
the scythians did.  to say the [[truth]], according to the [[law]] that nature
has imposed upon them, it is not properly for them either to will or
desire; their part is to suffer, obey, and [[consent]] and for this it is
that [[nature]] has given them a perpetual capacity, which in us is but at
times and uncertain; they are always fit for the encounter, that they may
be always ready when we are so “pati natee.”-[“born to suffer.”-seneca,
ep., 95.]--and whereas she has ordered that our appetites shall be
manifest by a prominent demonstration, she would have theirs to be hidden
and concealed within, and has furnished them with parts improper for
ostentation, and simply defensive.  such proceedings as this that follows
must be left to the amazonian licence: alexander marching his army
through hyrcania, thalestris, queen of the amazons, came with three
hundred [[light]] horse of her own-sex, well mounted, and armed, having left
the remainder of a very [[great]], [[army]] that followed her behind the
neighbouring mountains to give him a visit; where she publicly and in
plain terms told him that the fame of his valour and victories [[victory]] had
brought her thither to see him, and to make him an offer of her forces [[force]] to
assist him in the pursuit of his enterprises; and that, finding him so
handsome, [[young]], and vigorous, she, who was also [[perfect]] in all those
qualities, advised that they might [[lie]] together, to the end that from the
most valiant woman of the [[world]] and the bravest [[man]] then living, there
might spring some [[great]] and wonderful issue for the [[time]] to come.
alexander returned her thanks for all the rest; but, to give leisure for
the accomplishment of her [[last]] demand, he detained her thirteen days in
that place, which were spent in [[royal]] feasting and jollity, for the
welcome of so courageous a princess.

we are, almost throughout, [[unjust]] judges [[judge]] of their actions, as they are of
ours.  i confess the [[truth]] when it makes against me, as well as when ‘tis
on my side.  ‘tis an abominable intemperance that pushes them on so often
to [[change]], and that will not let them limit their affection to any one
person whatever; as is evident in that [[goddess]] to whom are attributed so
many changes [[change]] and so many lovers.  but ‘tis true withal that ‘tis contrary
to the [[nature]] of [[love]] if it be, not [[violent]]; and contrary to the nature
of [[violence]] if it be constant.  and they who wonder, exclaim, and keep
such a clutter to find out the causes of this frailty of theirs, as
unnatural and not to be believed, how comes it to pass they do not
discern how often they are themselves guilty of the same, without any
astonishment or miracle at all?  it would, peradventure, be more strange
to see the passion fixed; ‘tis not a simply corporeal passion.  if there
be no end to avarice and [[ambition]], there is doubtless no more in [[desire]];
it still lives [[life]] after satiety; and ‘tis impossible to prescribe either
constant satisfaction or end; it ever goes beyond its possession.  and by
that means inconstancy, peradventure, is in some sort more pardonable in
them than in us: they may plead, as well as we, the inclination to
variety and novelty [[common]] to us both; and secondly, without us, that
they buy a cat in a sack: joanna, queen of naples, caused her first
husband, andrews, to be [[hanged]] at the bars of her window in a halter of
gold and silk woven with her own hand, because in matrimonial
performances she neither found his parts nor abilities [[answer]] the
expectation she had conceived from his stature, [[beauty]], [[youth]], and
activity, by which she had been caught and deceived.  they may say there
is more pains [[pain]] required in doing than in suffering; and so they are on
their part always at least provided for necessity, whereas on our part it
may fall out otherwise.  for this [[reason]] it was, that [[plato]] wisely made a
law that before [[marriage]], to determine of the fitness of persons [[person]], the
judges should see the [[young]] [[men]] who pretended to it stripped stark naked,
and the [[women]] but to the girdle only.  when they come to try us they do
not, perhaps, find us worthy of their [[choice]]:

              “experta latus, madidoque simillima loro
               inguina, nec lassa stare coacta manu,
               deserit imbelles thalamos.”

          [“after using every endeavour to arouse him to action,
          she quits the barren couch.”--martial, vii. 58.]

‘tis not enough that a man’s will be [[good]]; weakness and insufficiency
lawfully break a [[marriage]],

               “et quaerendum aliunde foret nervosius illud,
               quod posset zonam solvere virgineam:”

     [“and seeks a more vigorous lover to undo her virgin zone.”
      --catullus, lxvii. 27.]

why not?  and according to her own standard, an amorous [[intelligence]],
more licentious and active,

               “si blando nequeat superesse labori.”

          [“if his [[strength]] be unequal to the pleasant task.”
           --virgil, georg., iii. 127.]

but is it not [[great]] impudence to offer our imperfections and
imbecilities, where we [[desire]] to please and leave a [[good]] [[opinion]] and
esteem of ourselves?  for the little that i am able to do now:

                                   “ad unum
                         mollis opus.”

          [“fit but for once.”--horace, epod., xii. 15.]

i would not trouble a woman, that i am to reverence and [[fear]]:

                              “fuge suspicari,
                    cujus undenum trepidavit aetas
                              claudere lustrum.”

          [“fear not him whose eleventh lustrum is closed.”
           --horace, od., ii. 4, 12, limits it to the eighth.]

nature should satisfy herself in having rendered this [[age]] miserable,
without rendering it ridiculous too.  i hate to see it, for one [[poor]] inch
of pitiful vigour which comes upon it but thrice a week, to strut and set
itself out with as much eagerness as if it could do mighty feats; a true
flame of flax; and laugh to see it so boil and bubble and then in a
moment so congealed and extinguished. this appetite ought to appertain
only to the flower of beautiful [[youth]]: trust not to its seconding that
indefatigable, full, constant, magnanimous ardour you [[think]] in you, for
it will certainly leave you in a pretty corner; but rather transfer it to
some tender, bashful, and ignorant boy, who yet trembles at the rod, and
blushes:

              “indum sanguineo veluti violaverit ostro
               si quis ebur, vel mista rubent ubi lilia multa
               alba rosa.”

     [“as [[indian]] ivory streaked with crimson, or [[white]] lilies mixed
     with the damask rose.”--aeneid, xii. 67.]

who can stay till the morning without dying for shame to behold the
disdain of the [[fair]] [[eyes]] of her who knows [[know]] so well his fumbling
impertinence,

               “et taciti fecere tamen convicia vultus,”

          [“though she nothing say, her looks betray her anger.”
           --ovid, amor., i. 7, 21.]

has never had the satisfaction and the [[glory]] of having cudgelled them
till they were weary, with the vigorous performance of one heroic night.
when i have observed any one to be vexed with me, i have not presently
accused her levity, but have been in [[doubt]], if i had not [[reason]] rather to
complain of [[nature]]; she has doubtless used me very uncivilly and
unkindly:

         “si non longa satis, si non bene mentula crassa
          nimirum sapiunt, videntque parvam
          matronae quoque mentulam illibenter:”

     [the first of these verses is the commencement of an epigram of the
     veterum poetayurra catalecta, and the two others are from an epigram
     in the same collection (ad matrones).  they describe untranslatably
     montaigne’s charge against [[nature]], indicated in the previous
     passage.]

and done me a most enormous injury.  every member i have, as much one as
another, is equally my own, and no other more properly makes me a man
than this.

i universally owe my entire picture to the [[public]].  the [[wisdom]] of my
instruction consists in [[liberty]], in [[truth]], in essence: disdaining to
introduce those little, feigned, [[common]], and provincial rules [[rule]] into the
catalogue of its real duties [[duty]]; all [[natural]], general, and constant,
of which civility and [[ceremony]] are daughters [[daughter]] indeed, but illegitimate.
we are sure to have the vices [[vice]] of appearance, when we shall have had those
of essence: when we have done with these, we run full drive upon the
others, if we find it must be so; for there is danger that we shall fancy
new offices, to excuse our negligence towards the [[natural]] ones, and to
confound them: and to manifest this, is it not seen that in places where
faults are crimes, crimes are but faults [[fault]]; that in nations where the laws
of decency are most rare and most remiss, the primitive laws [[law]] of common
reason are [[better]] observed: the innumerable multitude of so many duties
stifling and dissipating our [[care]].  the application of ourselves to light
and trivial things diverts us from those that are necessary and just.
oh, how these superficial [[men]] take an easy and plausible way in
comparison of ours!  these are shadows wherewith we palliate and [[pay]] one
another; but we do not [[pay]], but inflame the reckoning towards that great
judge, who tucks up our rags and tatters above our shameful parts, and
suckles not to view us all over, even to our inmost and most secret
ordures: it were a useful decency of our maidenly modesty, could it keep
him from this discovery.  in fine, whoever could reclaim [[man]] from so
scrupulous a verbal superstition, would do the [[world]] no [[great]] disservice.
our [[life]] is divided betwixt folly and prudence: whoever will write of it
but what is reverend and canonical, will leave above the one-half behind.
i do not excuse myself to myself; and if i did, it should rather be for
my excuses that i would excuse myself than for any other [[fault]]; i excuse
myself of [[certain]] humours [[humour]], which i [[think]] more [[strong]] in number than those
that are on my side.  in consideration of which, i will further say this
(for i [[desire]] to please every one, though it will be hard to do):

          “esse unum hominem accommodatum ad tantam morum
          ac sermonum et voluntatum varietatem,”

     [“for a [[man]] to conform to such a variety of manners,
     discourses, and will.”--q. cicero, de pet. consul, c. 14.]

that they ought not to condemn me for what i make authorities [[authority]], received
and approved by so many ages [[age]], to utter: and that there is no [[reason]] that
for want of rhyme they should refuse me the [[liberty]] they allow even to
churchmen of our nation and [[time]], and these amongst the most notable, of
which here are two of their brisk verses:

          “rimula, dispeream, ni monogramma tua est.”

          “un vit d’amy la contente et bien traicte:”

     [st. gelais, (euvres poetiques), p. 99, ed. of lyons, 1574.]

besides how many others.  i [[love]] modesty; and ‘tis not out of judgment
that i have chosen this scandalous way of speaking; ‘tis [[nature]] that has
chosen it for me.  i commend it not, no more than other forms that are
contrary to [[common]] use: but i excuse it, and by circumstances both
general and particular, alleviate its accusation.

but to proceed.  whence, too, can proceed that usurpation of sovereign
authority you take upon you over the [[women]], who favour you at their own
expense,

               “si furtiva dedit mira munuscula nocte,”

     [“if, in the stealthy night, she has made [[strange]] gifts.”
      --catullus, lxviii. 145.]

so that you presently assume the interest, coldness, and [[authority]] of a
husband?  ‘tis a [[free]] contract why do you not then keep to it, as you
would have them do?  there is no prescription upon voluntary things.
‘tis against the form, but it is true withal, that i in my [[time]] have
conducted this bargain as much as the [[nature]] of it would permit, as
conscientiously and with as much colour of [[justice]], as any other
contract; and that i never pretended other affection than what i really
had, and have truly acquainted them with its birth, vigour, and
declination, its fits and intermissions: a [[man]] does not always hold on
at the same rate.  i have been so sparing of my promises, that i think
i have been [[better]] than my word.  they have found me faithful even to
service of their inconstancy, a confessed and sometimes multiplied
inconstancy.  i never broke with them, whilst i had any hold at all, and
what [[occasion]] soever they have given me, never broke with them to hatred
or contempt; for such privacies, though obtained upon never so scandalous
terms, do yet oblige to some [[good]] will: i have sometimes, upon their
tricks and evasions, discovered a little indiscreet anger and [[impatience]];
for i am naturally [[subject]] to rash emotions, which, though [[light]] and
short, often spoil my market.  at any [[time]] they have consulted my
judgment, i never stuck to give them sharp and paternal counsels, and to
pinch them to the quick.  if i have left them any cause to [[complain]] of
me, ‘tis rather to have found in me, in comparison of the [[modern]] use, a
love foolishly conscientious than anything else.  i have kept my, word in
things wherein i might easily have been dispensed; they sometimes
surrendered themselves with [[reputation]], and upon articles that they were
willing enough should be broken by the conqueror: i have, more than once,
made [[pleasure]] in its [[greatest]] effort strike to the interest of their
honour; and where [[reason]] importuned me, have armed them against myself;
so that they ordered themselves more decorously and securely by my rules [[rule]],
when they frankly referred themselves to them, than they would have done
by their own.  i have ever, as much as i could, wholly taken upon myself
alone the hazard of our assignations, to acquit them; and have always
contrived our meetings after the hardest and most unusual manner, as less
suspected, and, moreover, in my [[opinion]], more accessible.  they are
chiefly more open, where they [[think]] they are most securely shut; things
least feared are least interdicted and observed; one may more boldly dare
what nobody thinks [[think]] you dare, which by its difficulty becomes easy.  never
had any [[man]] his approaches more impertinently generative; this way of
loving is more according to discipline but how ridiculous it is to our
people, and how ineffectual, who [[better]] knows [[know]] than i? yet i shall not
repent me of it; i have nothing there more to lose:

                        “me tabula sacer
                         votiva paries, indicat uvida
                         suspendisse potenti
                         vestimenta maris deo:”

     [“the holy wall, by my votive table, shows that i have [[hanged]] up my
     wet clothes in [[honour]] of the powerful [[god]] of the sea.”
      --horace, od., i.  5, 13.]

‘tis now [[time]] to speak out.  but as i might, per adventure, say to
another, “thou talkest idly, my friend; the [[love]] of thy [[time]] has little
commerce with [[faith]] and integrity;”

              “haec si tu postules
               ratione certa facere, nihilo plus agas,
               quam si des operam, ut cum ratione insanias:”

     [“if you seek to make these things [[certain]] by [[reason]], you will do no
     more than if you should seek to be mad in your senses.”
      --terence, eun., act i., sc.  i, v. 16.]

on the contrary, also, if it were for me to begin again, certainly it
should be by the same method and the same [[progress]], how fruitless soever
it might be to me; folly and insufficiency are commendable in an
incommendable action: the farther i go from their [[humour]] in this, i
approach so much nearer to my own.  as to the rest, in this traffic, i
did not suffer myself to be totally carried away; i pleased myself in it,
but did not forget myself.  i retained the little sense and discretion
that [[nature]] has given me, entire for their service and my own: a little
emotion, but no dotage.  my [[conscience]], also, was engaged in it, even to
debauch and licentiousness; but, as to ingratitude, treachery, malice,
and [[cruelty]], never.  i would not purchase the [[pleasure]] of this [[vice]] at
any price, but content myself with its proper and simple cost:

                    “nullum intra se vitium est.”

          [“nothing is a [[vice]] in itself.”--seneca, ep., 95.]

i almost equally hate a stupid and slothful laziness, as i do a toilsome
and painful employment; this pinches, the other lays me asleep.  i like
wounds as well as bruises, and cuts as well as dry blows.  i found in
this commerce, when i was the most able for it, a just moderation betwixt
these extremes.  [[love]] is a sprightly, lively, and [[gay]] agitation; i was
neither troubled nor afflicted with it, but heated, and moreover,
disordered; a [[man]] must stop there; it hurts nobody but fools [[fool]].  a young
man [[asked]] the philosopher panetius if it were becoming a [[wise]] [[man]] to be
in [[love]]?  “let the [[wise]] [[man]] look to that,” answered he, “but let not thou
and i, who are not so, engage ourselves in so stirring and [[violent]] an
affair, that enslaves us to others, and renders us contemptible to
ourselves.”  he said true that we are not to intrust a thing so
precipitous in itself to a [[soul]] that has not wherewithal to withstand its
assaults and disprove practically the saying of agesilaus, that prudence
and [[love]] cannot [[live]] together.  ‘tis a [[vain]] employment, ‘tis true,
unbecoming, shameful, and illegitimate; but carried on after this manner,
i look upon it as wholesome, and proper to enliven a drowsy [[soul]] and to
rouse up a heavy [[body]]; and, as an experienced physician, i would
prescribe it to a [[man]] of my form and condition, as soon as any other
recipe whatever, to rouse and keep him in vigour till well advanced in
years, and to defer the approaches of [[age]].  whilst we are but in the
suburbs, and that the pulse yet beats:

         “dum nova canities, dum prima et recta senectus,
          dum superest lachesi quod torqueat, et pedibus me
          porto meis, nullo dextram subeunte bacillo,”

     [“whilst the [[white]] hair is new, whilst old [[age]] is still straight
     shouldered, whilst there still remains something for lachesis to
     spin, whilst i walk on my own legs, and need no staff to lean upon.”
      --juvenal, iii. 26.]

we have need to be solicited and tickled by some such nipping incitation
as this.  do but observe what [[youth]], vigour, and gaiety it inspired the
good anacreon withal: and [[socrates]], who was then older than i, speaking
of an amorous object:

“leaning,” said he, “my shoulder to her shoulder, and my head to hers, as
we were reading together in a [[book]], i [[felt]], without dissembling, a sudden
sting in my shoulder like the biting of an insect, which i still felt
above five days after, and a continual itching crept into my [[heart]].”  so
that merely the accidental touch, and of a shoulder, heated and altered a
soul cooled and enerved by [[age]], and the strictest liver of all [[mankind]].
and, [[pray]], why not?  [[socrates]] was a [[man]], and would neither be, nor seem,
any other thing.  [[philosophy]] does not contend against [[natural]] pleasures [[pleasure]],
provided they be moderate, and only preaches moderation, not a total
abstinence; the [[power]] of its [[resistance]] is employed against those that
are adulterate and [[strange]].  [[philosophy]] says that the appetites of the
body ought not to be augmented by the [[mind]], and ingeniously warns us not
to stir up [[hunger]] by saturity; not to stuff, instead of merely filling,
the belly; to avoid all enjoyments that may bring us to want; and all
meats and drinks that bring thirst and [[hunger]]: as, in the service of
love, she prescribes us to take such an object as may simply satisfy the
body’s need, and does not stir the [[soul]], which ought only barely to
follow and assist the [[body]], without mixing in the affair.  but have i not
reason to hold that these precepts, which, indeed, in my [[opinion]], are
somewhat over strict, only concern a [[body]] in its [[best]] plight; and that in
a [[body]] broken with [[age]], as in a [[weak]] stomach, ‘tis excusable to warm and
support it by art [[arts]], and by the mediation of the fancy to restore the
appetite and cheerfulness it has lost of itself.

may we not say that there is nothing in us, during this earthly prison,
that is purely either corporeal or [[spiritual]]; and that we injuriously
break up a [[man]] alive; and that it seems but reasonable that we should
carry ourselves as favourably, at least, towards the use of [[pleasure]] as
we do towards that of pain!  [[pain]] was (for example) vehement even to
perfection in the souls [[soul]] of the saints by penitence: the [[body]] had there
naturally a sham by the [[right]] of union, and yet might have but little
part in the cause; and yet are they not contented that it should barely
follow and assist the afflicted [[soul]]: they have afflicted itself with
grievous and special torments, to the end that by emulation of one
another the [[soul]] and [[body]] might plunge [[man]] into misery by so much more
salutiferous as it is more severe.  in like manner, is it not [[injustice]],
in bodily pleasures [[pleasure]], to subdue and keep under the [[soul]], and say that it
must therein be dragged along as to some enforced and servile obligation
and necessity?  ‘tis rather her part to hatch and cherish them, there to
present herself, and to invite them, the [[authority]] of ruling belonging to
her; as it is also her part, in my [[opinion]], in pleasures [[pleasure]] that are proper
to her, to inspire and infuse into the [[body]] all the sentiment it is
capable of, and to study how to make them sweet and useful to it.  for it
is [[good]] [[reason]], as they say, that the [[body]] should not pursue its
appetites to the prejudice of the [[mind]]; but why is it not also the reason
that the [[mind]] should not pursue hers to the prejudice of the [[body]]?

i have no other passion to keep me in breath.  what avarice, [[ambition]],
quarrels, lawsuits do for others who, like me, have no particular
vocation, [[love]] would much more commodiously do; it would restore to me
vigilance, sobriety, grace, and the [[care]] of my [[person]]; it would reassure
my countenance, so that the grimaces of old [[age]], those deformed and
dismal looks, might not come to disgrace it; would again put me upon
sound and [[wise]] studies, by which i might render myself more loved and
esteemed, clearing my [[mind]] of the despair of itself and of its use, and
redintegrating it to itself; would divert me from a thousand troublesome
thoughts, a thousand melancholic humours [[humour]] that idleness and the ill
posture of our health loads us withal at such an [[age]]; would warm again,
in dreams [[dream]] at least, the [[blood]] that [[nature]] is abandoning; would hold up
the chin, and a little stretch out the nerves, the vigour and gaiety of
life of that [[poor]] [[man]] who is going full drive towards his ruin.  but i
very well [[understand]] that it is a commodity hard to recover: by weakness
and long [[experience]] our taste is become more delicate and nice; we ask
most when we bring least, and are harder to choose when we least deserve
to be accepted: and knowing ourselves for what we are, we are less
confident and more distrustful; nothing can assure us of being beloved,
considering our condition and theirs.  i am out of countenance to see
myself in company with those [[young]] wanton creatures:

              “cujus in indomito constantior inguine nervus,
               quam nova collibus arbor inhaeret.”

     [“in whose unbridled reins the vigour is more inherent than in the
     [[young]] tree on the hills.”--horace, epod., xii. 19.]

to what end should we go insinuate our misery amid their [[gay]] and
sprightly [[humour]]?

                   “possint ut juvenes visere fervidi.
                    multo non sine risu,
                    dilapsam in cineres facem.”

     [“as the fervid youths [[youth]] may behold, not without laughter, a burning
     torch worn to ashes.”--horace, od., iv.  13, 21.]

they have [[strength]] and [[reason]] on their side; let us give way; we have
nothing to do there: and these blossoms of springing [[beauty]] suffer not
themselves to be handled by such benumbed hands nor dealt with by mere
material means, for, as the old philosopher answered one who jeered him
because he could not gain the favour of a [[young]] girl he made [[love]] to:
“friend, the hook will not stick in such soft cheese.”  it is a commerce
that requires relation and correspondence: the other pleasures [[pleasure]] we receive
may be acknowledged by recompenses of another [[nature]], but this is not to
be paid but with the same [[kind]] of coin.  in earnest, in this [[sport]], the
pleasure i give more tickles my [[imagination]] than that they give me; now,
he has nothing of generosity in him who can receive [[pleasure]] where he
confers none--it must needs be a mean [[soul]] that will owe all, and can be
content to maintain relations with persons [[person]] to whom he is a continual
charge; there is no [[beauty]], grace, nor privacy so exquisite that a
gentleman ought to [[desire]] at this rate.  if they can only be [[kind]] to us
out of [[pity]], i had much rather [[die]] than [[live]] upon charity.  i would have
right to ask, in the style wherein i heard them beg in [[italy]]: “fate ben
per voi,”--[“do [[good]] for yourself.”]--or after the manner that cyrus
exhorted his soldiers, “who loves [[love]] himself let him [[follow]] me.”--“consort
yourself,” some one will say to me, “with [[women]] of your own condition,
whom like [[fortune]] will render more easy to your [[desire]].”  o ridiculous
and insipid composition!

                                   “nolo
                    barbam vellere mortuo leoni.”

          [“i would not pluck the beard from a [[dead]] lion.”--martial]

xenophon lays it for an objection and an accusation against menon, that
he never made [[love]] to any but old [[women]].  for my part, i take more
pleasure in but seeing the just and sweet mixture of two [[young]] beauties [[beauty]],
or only in meditating on it in my fancy, than myself in acting second in
a pitiful and imperfect conjunction;

     [which cotton renders, “than to be myself an actor in the second
     with a deformed creature.”]

i leave that fantastic appetite to the [[emperor]] galba, who was only for
old curried flesh: and to this [[poor]] wretch:

              “o ego di faciant talem to cernere possim,
               caraque mutatis oscula ferre comis,
               amplectique meis corpus non pingue lacertis!”

     [ovid, who (ex.  ponto, i. 4, 49) writes to his [[wife]], “o would the
     gods arrange that such i might see thee, and bring dear kisses to
     thy changed locks, and embrace thy withered [[body]] with my arms”]

amongst [[chief]] deformities i reckon forced and artificial beauties [[beauty]]: hemon,
a [[young]] boy of chios, thinking by fine dressing to acquire the beauty
that [[nature]] had denied him, came to the philosopher arcesilaus and asked
him if it was possible for a [[wise]] [[man]] to be in love--“yes,” replied he,
“provided it be not with a farded and adulterated [[beauty]] like thine.”

     [diogenes laertius, iv.  36.  the [[question]] was whether a [[wise]] man
     could [[love]] him.  cotton has “emonez, a [[young]] courtezan of chios.”]

ugliness of a confessed antiquity is to me less old and less ugly than
another that is polished and plastered up.  shall i speak it, without the
danger of having my throat cut? [[love]], in my [[opinion]], is not properly and
naturally in its season, but in the [[age]] next to [[childhood]],

                   “quem si puellarum insereres choro,
                    mille sagaces falleret hospites,
                    discrimen obscurum, solutis
                    crinibus ambiguoque vultu:”

     [“whom if thou shouldst place in a company of girls, it would
     require a thousand experts to distinguish him, with his loose locks
     and ambiguous countenance.”--horace, od., ii. 5, 21.]

nor [[beauty]] neither; for whereas [[homer]] extends it so far as to the budding
of the beard, [[plato]] himself has remarked this as rare: and the [[reason]] why
the sophist bion so pleasantly called the first appearing hairs of
adolescence ‘aristogitons’ and ‘harmodiuses’--[plutarch, on [[love]], c.34.]--
is sufficiently known.  i find it in virility already in some sort a
little out of date, though not so much as in old [[age]];

                   “importunus enim transvolat aridas
                    quercus.”

               [“for it uncivilly passes over withered oaks.”
                --horace, od., iv. 13, 9.]

and marguerite, queen of navarre, like a woman, very far extends the
advantage of [[women]], ordaining that it is [[time]], at thirty years old, to
convert the title of [[fair]] into that of [[good]].  the shorter [[authority]] we
give to [[love]] over our lives [[life]], ‘tis so much the [[better]] for us.  do but
observe his port; ‘tis a beardless boy.  who knows [[know]] not how, in his school
they proceed contrary to all order; study, exercise, and usage are their
ways for insufficiency there novices [[rule]]:

                         “amor ordinem nescit.”

          [“love ignores rules [[rule]].” (or:) “love knows [[know]] no [[rule]].”
           --st. jerome, letter to chyomatius.]

doubtless his conduct is much more graceful when mixed with inadvertency
and trouble; miscarriages and ill successes give him point and grace;
provided it be sharp and eager, ‘tis no [[great]] matter whether it be
prudent or no: do but observe how he goes reeling, tripping, and playing:
you put him in the stocks when you guide him by art [[arts]] and [[wisdom]]; and he is
restrained of his [[divine]] [[liberty]] when put into those hairy and callous
clutches.

as to the rest, i often hear the [[women]] set out this [[intelligence]] as
entirely [[spiritual]], and disdain to put the interest the senses there have
into consideration; everything there serves; but i can say that i have
often seen that we have excused the weakness of their understandings in
favour of their outward [[beauty]], but have never yet seen that in favour of
mind, how mature and full soever, any of them would hold out a hand to a
body that was never so little in decadence.  why does not some one of
them take it into her head to make that [[noble]] socratical bargain between
body and [[soul]], purchasing a philosophical and [[spiritual]] [[intelligence]] and
generation at the price of her thighs, which is the highest price she can
get for them?  [[plato]] ordains in his laws [[law]] that he who has performed any
signal and advantageous exploit in [[war]] may not be refused during the
whole expedition, his [[age]] or ugliness notwithstanding, a kiss or any
other amorous favour from any woman whatever.  what he thinks [[think]] to be so
just in recommendation of [[military]] valour, why may it not be the same in
recommendation of any other [[good]] quality? and why does not some woman
take a fancy to possess over her companions the [[glory]] of this chaste
love?  i may well say chaste;

                    “nam si quando ad praelia ventum est,
               ut quondam in stipulis magnus sine viribus ignis,
               incassum furit:”

     [“for when they sometimes engage in love’s [[battle]],
     his sterile ardour lights [[light]] up but as the flame of a straw.”
      --virgil, georg., iii.  98.]

the vices [[vice]] that are stifled in the [[thought]] are not the worst.

to conclude this notable commentary, which has escaped from me in a
torrent of babble, a torrent sometimes impetuous and hurtful,

              “ut missum sponsi furtivo munere malum
               procurrit casto virginis a gremio,
               quod miserae oblitae molli sub veste locatuat,
               dum adventu matris prosilit, excutitur,
               atque illud prono praeceps agitur decursu
               huic manat tristi conscius ore rubor.”

     [“as when an apple, sent by a lover secretly to his mistress, falls
     from the chaste virgin’s bosom, where she had quite forgotten it;
     when, starting at her mother’s coming in, it is shaken out and rolls
     over the floor before her [[eyes]], a conscious blush covers her face.”
      --catullus, lxv. 19.]

i say that males and females are cast in the same mould, and that,
education and usage excepted, the difference is not [[great]].  plato
indifferently invites both the one and the other to the [[society]] of all
studies, exercises, and vocations, both [[military]] and civil, in his
commonwealth; and the philosopher antisthenes rejected all distinction
betwixt their [[virtue]] and ours.  it is much more easy to accuse one sex
than to excuse the other; ‘tis according to the saying,

               “le fourgon se moque de la paele.”
                   [“the pot and the kettle.”]

chapter vi

of coaches

it is very easy to verify, that [[great]] authors, when they write of causes,
not only make use of those they [[think]] to be the true causes, but also of
those they [[believe]] not to be so, provided they have in them some beauty
and invention: they speak true and usefully enough, if it be ingeniously.
we cannot make ourselves sure of the supreme cause, and therefore crowd a
great many together, to see if it may not accidentally be amongst them:

               “namque unam dicere causam
          non satis est, verum plures, unde una tamen sit.”

     [lucretius, vi. 704.--the sense is in the preceding passage.]

do you ask me, whence comes the custom of blessing those who sneeze?
we break wind three several ways; that which sallies from below is too
filthy; that which breaks out from the mouth carries with it some
reproach of gluttony; the third is sneezing, which, because it proceeds
from the head and is without offence, we give it this civil reception: do
not laugh at this distinction; they say ‘tis aristotle’s.

i [[think]] i have seen in plutarch’ (who of all the authors i [[know]], is he
who has [[best]] mixed art [[arts]] with [[nature]], and [[judgment]] with knowledge), his
giving as a [[reason]] for the, rising of the stomach in those who are at
sea, that it is occasioned by [[fear]]; having first found out some [[reason]] by
which he proves that [[fear]] may [[produce]] such an effect.  i, who am very
subject to it, [[know]] well that this cause concerns not me; and i [[know]] it,
not by argument, but by necessary [[experience]].  without instancing what
has been told me, that the same thing often happens in beasts, especially
hogs, who are out of all apprehension of danger; and what an acquaintance
of mine told me of himself, that though very [[subject]] to it, the
disposition to vomit has three or four times [[time]] gone off him, being very
afraid in a [[violent]] storm, as it happened to that ancient:

          “pejus vexabar, quam ut periculum mihi succurreret;”

          [“i was too ill to [[think]] of danger.” (or the reverse:)
          “i was too frightened to be ill.”--seneca, ep., 53. 2]

i was never afraid upon the water, nor indeed in any other peril (and i
have had enough before my [[eyes]] that would have sufficed, if [[death]] be
one), so as to be astounded to lose my [[judgment]].  [[fear]] springs sometimes
as much from want of [[judgment]] as from want of [[courage]].  all the dangers i
have been in i have looked upon without winking, with an open, sound, and
entire sight; and, indeed, a [[man]] must have [[courage]] to [[fear]].  it formerly
served me [[better]] than other [[help]], so to order and regulate my retreat,
that it was, if not without [[fear]], nevertheless without affright and
astonishment; it was agitated, indeed, but not amazed or stupefied.
great souls [[soul]] go yet much farther, and [[present]] to us flights, not only
steady and temperate, but moreover lofty.  let us make a relation of that
which alcibiades reports of [[socrates]], his fellow in arms: “i found him,”
 says he, “after the rout of our [[army]], him and lachez, [[last]] among those
who fled, and considered him at my leisure and in security, for i was
mounted on a [[good]] horse, and he on foot, as he had fought.  i took
notice, in the first place, how much [[judgment]] and resolution he showed,
in comparison of lachez, and then the bravery of his march, nothing
different from his ordinary gait; his sight firm and regular, considering
and judging what passed about him, looking one while upon those, and then
upon others, [[friends]] and enemies [[enemy]], after such a manner as encouraged
those, and signified to the others that he would sell his [[life]] dear to
any one who should attempt to take it from him, and so they came off; for
people are not willing to attack such [[kind]] of [[men]], but pursue those they
see are in a fright.”  that is the testimony of this [[great]] captain, which
teaches us, what we every day [[experience]], that nothing so much throws us
into dangers as an inconsiderate eagerness of getting ourselves clear of
them:

     “quo timoris minus est, eo minus ferme periculi est.”

     [“when there is least [[fear]], there is for the most part least
     danger.”--livy, xxii. 5.]

our [[people]] are to blame who say that such an one is afraid of [[death]], when
they would express that he thinks [[think]] of it and foresees it: foresight is
equally convenient in what concerns us, whether [[good]] or ill.  to consider
and [[judge]] of danger is, in some sort, the reverse to being astounded.
i do not find myself [[strong]] enough to sustain the [[force]] and impetuosity
of this passion of [[fear]], nor of any other vehement passion whatever: if i
was once conquered and beaten down by it, i should never rise again very
sound.  whoever should once make my [[soul]] lose her footing, would never
set her upright again: she retastes and researches herself too
profoundly, and too much to the quick, and therefore would never let the
wound she had received heal and cicatrise.  it has been well for me that
no sickness has yet discomposed her: at every charge made upon me, i
preserve my utmost opposition and defence; by which means the first that
should rout me would keep me from ever rallying again.  i have no
after-game to play: on which side soever the inundation breaks my banks,
i [[lie]] open, and am drowned without remedy.  epicurus says, that a wise
man can never become a [[fool]]; i have an [[opinion]] reverse to this sentence,
which is, that he who has once been a very [[fool]], will never after be very
wise. [[god]] grants me cold according to my cloth, and passions
proportionable to the means i have to withstand them: [[nature]] having laid
me open on the one side, has covered me on the other; having disarmed me
of [[strength]], she has armed me with insensibility and an apprehension that
is regular, or, if you will, dull.

i cannot now long endure (and when i was [[young]] could much less) either
coach, litter, or boat, and hate all other riding but on horseback, both
in town and [[country]].  but i can bear a litter worse than a coach; and, by
the same [[reason]], a rough agitation upon the water, whence [[fear]] is
produced, [[better]] than the motions of a calm.  at the little jerks of
oars, stealing the vessel from under us, i find, i [[know]] not how, both my
head and my stomach disordered; neither-can i endure to sit upon a
tottering chair.  when the sail or the current carries us equally, or
that we are towed, the [[equal]] agitation does not disturb me at all; ‘tis
an interrupted motion that offends me, and most of all when most slow: i
cannot otherwise express it.  the physicians have ordered me to squeeze
and gird myself about the bottom of the belly with a napkin to remedy
this [[evil]]; which however i have not tried, being accustomed to wrestle
with my own defects, and overcome them myself.

would my memory serve me, i should not [[think]] my [[time]] ill spent in setting
down here the infinite variety that [[history]] presents [[present]] us of the use of
chariots in the service of [[war]]: various, according to the nations and
according to the [[age]]; in my [[opinion]], of [[great]] necessity and effect; so
that it is a wonder that we have lost all [[knowledge]] of them.  i will only
say this, that very lately, in our fathers’ [[time]], the hungarians made
very advantageous use of them against the turks; having in every one of
them a targetter and a musketeer, and a number of harquebuses piled ready
and loaded, and all covered with a pavesade like a galliot--[canvas
spread along the side of a ship of [[war]], in action to screen the movements
of those on board.]--they formed the front of their [[battle]] with three
thousand such coaches, and after the cannon had played, made them all
pour in their shot upon the [[enemy]], who had to swallow that volley before
they tasted of the rest, which was no little advance; and that done,
these chariots charged into their squadrons to break them and open a way
for the rest; besides the use they might make of them to flank the
soldiers in a place of danger when marching to the field, or to cover a
post, and fortify it in haste.  in my [[time]], a gentleman on one of our
frontiers, unwieldy of [[body]], and finding no horse able to carry his
weight, having a quarrel, rode through the [[country]] in a chariot of this
fashion, and found [[great]] convenience in it.  but let us leave these
chariots of [[war]].

as if their effeminacy--[which cotton translates: “as if the
insignificancy of coaches.” ]--had not been sufficiently known by better
proofs, the [[last]] kings [[king]] of our first [[race]] travelled in a chariot drawn by
four oxen.  marc antony was the first at [[rome]] who caused himself to be
drawn in a coach by lions, and a singing wench with him.

     [cytheris, the roman courtezan.--plutarch’s [[life]] of antony, c. 3.
     this, was the same [[person]] who is introduced by gallus under the name
     of lycoris.  gallus doubtless knew her personally.]

heliogabalus did since as much, calling himself cybele, the [[mother]] of the
gods; and also drawn by tigers, taking upon him the [[person]] of the god
bacchus; he also sometimes harnessed two stags to his coach, another time
four dogs, and another four naked wenches, causing himself to be drawn by
them in pomp, stark naked too.  the [[emperor]] firmus caused his chariot to
be drawn by ostriches of a prodigious size, so that it seemed rather to
fly than roll.

the strangeness of these inventions puts this other fancy in my head:
that it is a [[kind]] of pusillanimity in monarchs, and a testimony that they
do not sufficiently [[understand]] themselves what they are, when they study
to make themselves honoured and to appear [[great]] by excessive expense: it
were indeed excusable in a [[foreign]] [[country]], but amongst their own
subjects, where they are in [[sovereign]] command, and may do what they
please, it derogates from their [[dignity]] the most supreme [[degree]] of honour
to which they can arrive: just as, methinks, it is superfluous in a
private gentleman to go finely dressed at [[home]]; his house, his
attendants, and his kitchen sufficiently [[answer]] for him.  the [[advice]] that
isocrates gives his [[king]] seems to be grounded upon [[reason]]: that he should
be splendid in plate and furniture; forasmuch as it is an expense of
duration that devolves on his successors; and that he should avoid all
magnificences that will in a short [[time]] be forgotten.  i loved to go fine
when i was a younger [[brother]], for want of other ornament; and it became
me well: there are some upon whom their [[rich]] clothes weep: we have
strange stories of the frugality of our kings [[king]] about their own persons [[person]] and
in their gifts: kings [[king]] who were [[great]] in [[reputation]], valour, and [[fortune]].
demosthenes vehemently opposes the [[law]] of his [[city]] that assigned the
public [[money]] for the pomp of their [[public]] plays and festivals: he would
that their greatness should be seen in numbers of ships well equipped,
and [[good]] armies [[army]] well provided for; and there is [[good]] [[reason]] to condemn
theophrastus, who, in his [[book]] on riches [[rich]], establishes a contrary [[opinion]],
and maintains that sort of expense to be the true fruit of abundance.
they are delights, says [[aristotle]], that a only please the baser sort of
the [[people]], and that vanish from the memory as soon as the [[people]] are
sated with them, and for which no serious and judicious [[man]] can have any
esteem.  this [[money]] would, in my [[opinion]], be much more royally, as more
profitably, justly, and durably, laid out in ports, havens, walls, and
fortifications; in sumptuous buildings, churches [[church]], hospitals, colleges,
the reforming of streets and highways: wherein [[pope]] gregory xiii.  will
leave a laudable memory to future times [[time]]: and wherein our queen catherine
would to long [[posterity]] manifest her [[natural]] liberality and munificence,
did her means supply her affection.  [[fortune]] has done me a [[great]] despite
in interrupting the [[noble]] structure of the pont-neuf of our [[great]] [[city]],
and depriving me of the [[hope]] of seeing it finished before i [[die]].

moreover, it seems to subjects [[subject]], who are spectators of these triumphs,
that their own riches [[rich]] are exposed before them, and that they are
entertained at their own expense: for the [[people]] are apt to presume of
kings, as we do of our servants, that they are to take [[care]] to provide us
all things necessary in abundance, but not touch it themselves; and
therefore the [[emperor]] galba, being pleased with a musician who played to
him at supper, called for his money-box, and gave him a handful of crowns
that he took out of it, with these words: “this is not the [[public]] [[money]],
but my own.”  yet it so falls out that the [[people]], for the most part,
have [[reason]] on their side, and that the princes [[prince]] feed their [[eyes]] with what
they have need of to fill their bellies.

liberality itself is not in its true lustre in a [[sovereign]] hand: private
men have therein the most [[right]]; for, to take it exactly, a [[king]] has
nothing properly his own; he owes himself to others: [[authority]] is not
given in favour of the magistrate, but of the [[people]]; a superior is never
made so for his own [[profit]], but for the [[profit]] of the inferior, and a
physician for the sick [[person]], and not for himself: all magistracy, as
well as all art [[arts]], has its end out of itself wherefore the tutors of young
princes, who make it their [[business]] to imprint in them this [[virtue]] of
liberality, and preach to them to deny nothing and to [[think]] nothing so
well spent as what they give (a doctrine that i have known in great
credit in my time), either have more particular regard to their own
profit than to that of their master, or ill [[understand]] to whom they
speak.  it is too easy a thing to inculcate liberality on him who has as
much as he will to practise it with at the expense of others; and, the
estimate not being proportioned to the measure of the gift but to the
measure of the means of him who gives it, it comes to nothing in so
mighty hands; they find themselves prodigal before they can be reputed
liberal.  and it is but a little recommendation, in comparison with other
royal virtues [[virtue]]: and the only one, as the [[tyrant]] dionysius said, that suits
well with [[tyranny]] itself.  i should rather [[teach]] him this verse of the
ancient labourer:

     [“that whoever will have a [[good]] crop must sow with his hand, and not
     pour out of the sack.”--plutarch, apothegms,  whether the ancients
     were more excellent in arms than in learning.]

he must scatter it abroad, and not lay it on a heap in one place: and
that, seeing he is to give, or, to say [[better]], to [[pay]] and restore to so
many [[people]] according as they have deserved, he ought to be a [[loyal]] and
discreet disposer.  if the liberality of a [[prince]] be without measure or
discretion, i had rather he were covetous.

royal [[virtue]] seems most to consist in [[justice]]; and of all the parts of
justice that [[best]] denotes a [[king]] which accompanies liberality, for this
they have particularly reserved to be performed by themselves, whereas
all other sorts of [[justice]] they remit to the administration of others.
an immoderate bounty is a very [[weak]] means to acquire for them [[good]] will;
it checks more [[people]] than it allures:

          “quo in plures usus sis, minus in multos uti possis....
          quid autem est stultius, quam, quod libenter facias,
          curare ut id diutius facere non possis;”

     [“by how much more you use it to many, by so much less will you be
     in a capacity to use it to many more.  and what greater folly can
     there be than to order it so that what you would willingly do, you
     cannot do longer.”--cicero, de offic., ii. 15.]

and if it be conferred without due [[respect]] of [[merit]], it puts him out of
countenance who receives it, and is received ungraciously.  tyrants [[tyrant]] have
been sacrificed to the [[hatred]] of the [[people]] by the hands of those very
men they have unjustly advanced; such [[kind]] of [[men]] as buffoons, panders,
fiddlers, and such ragamuffins, thinking to assure to themselves the
possession of benefits unduly received, if they manifest to have him in
hatred and disdain of whom they hold them, and in this associate
themselves to the [[common]] [[judgment]] and [[opinion]].

the subjects [[subject]] of a [[prince]] excessive in gifts grow excessive in asking,
and regulate their demands, not by [[reason]], but by [[example]].  we have,
seriously, very often [[reason]] to blush at our own impudence: we are
over-paid, according to [[justice]], when the recompense equals [[equal]] our service;
for do we owe nothing of [[natural]] obligation to our princes [[prince]]?  if he bear
our charges, he does too much; ‘tis enough that he contribute to them:
the overplus is called benefit, which cannot be exacted: for the very
name liberality sounds of [[liberty]].

in our [[fashion]] it is never done; we never reckon what we have received;
we are only for the future liberality; wherefore, the more a prince
exhausts himself in giving, the poorer he grows in [[friends]].  how should
he satisfy immoderate desires [[desire]], that still increase as they are fulfilled?
he who has his thoughts [[thought]] upon taking, never thinks [[think]] of what he has taken;
covetousness has nothing so properly and so much its own as ingratitude.

the [[example]] of cyrus will not do amiss in this place, to serve the kings
of these times [[time]] for a touchstone to [[know]] whether their gifts are well or
ill bestowed, and to see how much [[better]] that [[emperor]] conferred them than
they do, by which means they are reduced to borrow of unknown subjects [[subject]],
and rather of them whom they have wronged than of them on whom they have
conferred their benefits, and so receive aids wherein there is nothing of
gratuitous but the name.  croesus reproached him with his bounty, and
cast up to how much his treasure would amount if he had been a little
closer-handed.  he had a [[mind]] to justify his liberality, and therefore
sent despatches into all parts to the grandees of his dominions whom he
had particularly advanced, entreating every one of them to supply him
with as much [[money]] as they could, for a pressing [[occasion]], and to send
him particulars of what each could advance.  when all these answers [[answer]] were
brought to him, every one of his [[friends]], not thinking it enough barely
to offer him so much as he had received from his bounty, and adding to it
a [[great]] deal of his own, it appeared that the sum amounted to a great
deal more than croesus’ reckoning.  whereupon cyrus: “i am not,” said he,
“less in [[love]] with riches [[rich]] than other princes [[prince]], but rather a better
husband; you see with how small a venture i have acquired the inestimable
treasure of so many [[friends]], and how much more faithful treasurers they
are to me than mercenary [[men]] without obligation, without affection; and
my [[money]] [[better]] laid up than in chests, bringing upon me the [[hatred]],
envy, and contempt of other princes [[prince]].”

the emperors [[emperor]] excused the superfluity of their plays and [[public]] spectacles
by [[reason]] that their [[authority]] in some sort (at least in outward
appearance) depended upon the will of the [[people]] of [[rome]], who, [[time]] out
of [[mind]], had been accustomed to be entertained and caressed with such
shows and excesses.  but they were private [[citizens]], who had nourished
this custom to gratify their fellow-citizens and companions (and chiefly
out of their own purses) by such profusion and magnificence it had quite
another taste when the masters came to imitate it:

          “pecuniarum translatio a justis dominis ad alienos
          non debet liberalis videri.”

     [“the transferring of [[money]] from the [[right]] owners to strangers
     ought not to have the title of liberality.”
      --cicero, de offic., i. 14.]

philip, seeing that his [[son]] went about by presents [[present]] to gain the affection
of the macedonians, reprimanded him in a letter after this manner: “what!
hast thou a [[mind]] that thy subjects [[subject]] shall look upon thee as their
cash-keeper and not as their [[king]]?  wilt thou tamper with them to win
their affections?  do it, then, by the benefits of thy [[virtue]], and not by
those of thy chest.”  and yet it was, doubtless, a fine thing to bring
and plant within the amphitheatre a [[great]] number of vast trees, with all
their branches in their full verdure, representing a [[great]] shady forest,
disposed in excellent order; and, the first day, to throw into it a
thousand ostriches and a thousand stags, a thousand boars, and a thousand
fallow-deer, to be killed and disposed of by the [[people]]: the next day, to
cause a hundred [[great]] lions, a hundred leopards, and three hundred bears
to be killed in his presence; and for the third day, to make three
hundred pair of gladiators [[fight]] it out to the [[last]], as the emperor
probus did.  it was also very fine to see those vast amphitheatres, all
faced with marble without, curiously wrought with figures and statues,
and within glittering with rare enrichments:

               “baltheus en! gemmis, en illita porticus auro:”

     [“a belt glittering with jewels, and a portico overlaid with gold.”
      --calpurnius, eclog., vii. 47.  a baltheus was a shoulder-belt or
     baldric.]

all the sides of this vast space filled and environed, from the bottom to
the top, with three or four score rows of seats, all of marble also, and
covered with cushions:

                         “exeat, inquit,
                    si pudor est, et de pulvino surgat equestri,
                    cujus res legi non sufficit;”

     [“let him go out, he said, if he has any sense of shame, and rise
     from the equestrian cushion, whose estate does not satisfy the [[law]].”
      --juvenal, iii. 153.  the equites were required to possess a fortune
     of 400 sestertia, and they sat on the first fourteen rows behind the
     orchestra.]

where a hundred thousand [[men]] might sit at their ease: and, the place
below, where the games were played, to make it, by art [[arts]], first open and
cleave in chasms, representing caves that vomited out the beasts designed
for the spectacle; and then, secondly, to be overflowed by a deep sea,
full of sea monsters, and laden with ships of [[war]], to represent a naval
battle; and, thirdly, to make it dry and even again for the combat of the
gladiators; and, for the fourth scene, to have it strown with vermilion
grain and storax,--[a resinous gum.]--instead of sand, there to make a
solemn feast for all that infinite number of [[people]]: the [[last]] act of one
only day:

              “quoties nos descendentis arenae
               vidimus in partes, ruptaque voragine terrae
               emersisse feras, et eisdem saepe latebris
               aurea cum croceo creverunt arbuta libro!....
               nec solum nobis silvestria cernere monstra
               contigit; aequoreos ego cum certantibus ursis
               spectavi vitulos, et equorum nomine dignum,
               sen deforme pecus, quod in illo nascitur amni....”

     [“how often have we seen the stage of the theatre descend and part
     asunder, and from a chasm in the [[earth]] wild beasts emerge, and then
     presently give birth to a grove of gilded trees, that put forth
     blossoms of enamelled flowers.  nor yet of sylvan marvels alone had
     we sight: i saw sea-calves [[fight]] with bears, and a deformed sort of
     cattle, we might call sea-horses.”--calpurnius, eclog., vii. 64.]

sometimes they made a high mountain advance itself, covered with
fruit-trees and other leafy trees, sending down rivulets of water from
the top, as from the mouth of a fountain: otherwhiles, a [[great]] ship was
seen to come rolling in, which opened and divided of itself, and after
having disgorged from the hold four or five hundred beasts for [[fight]],
closed again, and vanished without [[help]].  at other times [[time]], from the floor
of this place, they made spouts of perfumed water dart their streams
upward, and so high as to sprinkle all that infinite multitude.  to
defend themselves from the injuries of the weather, they had that vast
place one while covered over with purple curtains of needlework, and
by-and-by with silk of one or another colour, which they drew off or
on in a moment, as they had a [[mind]]:

              “quamvis non modico caleant spectacula sole,
               vela reducuntur, cum venit hermogenes.”

     [“the curtains, though the sun should scorch the spectators, are
     drawn in, when hermogenes appears.”-martial, xii.  29, 15.  m.
     tigellius hermogenes, whom horace and others have satirised.  one
     editor calls him “a noted thief,” another: “he was a literary
     amateur of no ability, who expressed his critical opinions [[opinion]] with too
     [[great]] a [[freedom]] to please the poets of his day.”  d.w.]

the network also that was set before the [[people]] to defend them from the
violence of these turned-out beasts was woven of gold:

                   “auro quoque torts refulgent
                    retia.”

               [“the woven nets are refulgent with gold.”
                --calpurnius, ubi supra.]

if there be anything excusable in such excesses as these, it is where the
novelty and invention create more wonder than the expense; even in these
vanities we discover how fertile those ages [[age]] were in other [[kind]] of wits
than these of ours.  it is with this sort of fertility, as with all other
products of [[nature]]: not that she there and then employed her utmost
force: we do not go; we rather run up and down, and whirl this way and
that; we turn back the way we came.  i am afraid our [[knowledge]] is [[weak]] in
all senses; we neither see far forward nor far backward; our
understanding comprehends little, and lives [[life]] but a little while; ‘tis
short both in extent of [[time]] and extent of matter:

                   “vixere fortes ante agamemnona
                    mufti, sed omnes illacrymabiles
                    urgentur, ignotique longs
                    nocte.”

     [ many brave [[men]] lived before [[agamemnon]], but all are pressed by the
     long night unmourned and unknown.”--horace, od., iv. 9, 25.]

              “et supra bellum thebanum et funera trojae
               non alias alii quoque res cecinere poetae?”

     [“why before the theban [[war]] and the destruction of troy, have not
     other poets sung other events?”--lucretius, v. 327.  montaigne here
     diverts himself m giving lucretius’ words a construction directly
     contrary to what they bear in the poem.  lucretius puts the
     [[question]], why if the [[earth]] had existed from all eternity, there had
     not been poets, before the theban [[war]], to sing [[men’s]] exploits.
     --coste.]

and the narrative of solon, of what he had learned from the egyptian
priests, touching the long [[life]] of their [[state]], and their manner of
learning and preserving [[foreign]] histories [[history]], is not, methinks, a testimony
to be refused in this consideration:

     “si interminatam in omnes partes magnitudinem regionum videremus et
     temporum, in quam se injiciens animus et intendens, ita late
     longeque peregrinatur, ut nullam oram ultimi videat, in qua possit
     insistere: in haec immensitate .  .  .  infinita vis innumerabilium
     appareret fomorum.”

     [“could we see on all parts the unlimited magnitude of regions and
     of times [[time]], upon which the [[mind]] being intent, could wander so far and
     wide, that no limit is to be seen, in which it can bound its eye, we
     should, in that infinite immensity, discover an infinite [[force]] of
     innumerable atoms.”  here also montaigne puts a sense quite
     different from what the words bear in the original; but the
     application he makes of them is so [[happy]] that one would declare they
     were actually put together only to express his own sentiments.  “et
     temporum” is an addition by montaigne.--coste.]

though all that has arrived, by report, of our [[knowledge]] of times [[time]] past
should be true, and known by some one [[person]], it would be less than
nothing in comparison of what is unknown.  and of this same image of the
world, which glides away whilst we [[live]] upon it, how wretched and limited
is the [[knowledge]] of the most [[curious]]; not only of particular events,
which [[fortune]] often renders exemplary and of [[great]] concern, but of the
state of [[great]] governments [[government]] and nations, a hundred more escape us than
ever come to our [[knowledge]].  we make a mighty [[business]] of the invention
of artillery and printing, which other [[men]] at the other end of the [[world]],
in [[china]], had a thousand years ago.  did we but see as much of the world
as we do not see, we should perceive, we may well [[believe]], a perpetual
multiplication and vicissitude of forms.  there is nothing [[single]] and
rare in [[respect]] of [[nature]], but in [[respect]] of our [[knowledge]], which is a
wretched foundation whereon to ground our rules [[rule]], and that represents to
us a very false image of things.  as we nowadays vainly conclude the
declension and decrepitude of the [[world]], by the arguments we extract from
our own weakness and decay:

          “jamque adeo est affecta aetas effoet aque tellus;”

          [“our [[age]] is feeble, and the [[earth]] less fertile.”
           --lucretius, ii. 1151.]

so did he vainly conclude as to its birth and [[youth]], by the vigour he
observed in the wits of his [[time]], abounding in novelties and the
invention of divers [[arts]]:

         “verum, ut opinor, habet novitatem summa, recensque
          natura est mundi, neque pridem exordia coepit
          quare etiam quaedam nunc artes expoliuntur,
          nunc etiam augescunt; nunc addita navigiis sunt
          multa.”

     [“but, as i am of [[opinion]], the whole of the [[world]] is of recent
     origin, nor had its commencement in remote times [[time]]; wherefore it is
     that some [[arts]] are still being refined, and some just on the
     increase; at [[present]] many additions are being made to shipping.”
      --lucretius, v. 331.]

our [[world]] has lately discovered another (and who will assure us that it
is the [[last]] of its brothers [[brother]], since the daemons, the sybils, and we
ourselves have been ignorant of this till now?), as large, well-peopled,
and fruitful as this whereon we [[live]] and yet so raw and childish, that we
are still teaching it it’s a b c: ‘tis not above fifty years since it
knew neither letters, weights, measures, vestments, corn, nor vines: it
was then quite naked in the mother’s lap, and only lived upon what she
gave it.  if we rightly conclude of our end, and this poet of the
youthfulness of that [[age]] of his, that other [[world]] will only enter into
the [[light]] when this of ours shall make its exit; the [[universe]] will fall
into paralysis; one member will be useless, the other in vigour.  i am
very much afraid that we have greatly precipitated its declension and
ruin by our contagion; and that we have sold it opinions [[opinion]] and our [[arts]] at
a very dear rate.  it was an infant [[world]], and yet we have not whipped
and subjected it to our discipline by the advantage of our [[natural]] worth
and [[force]], neither have we won it by our [[justice]] and goodness, nor
subdued it by our magnanimity.  most of their answers [[answer]], and the
negotiations we have had with them, witness that they were nothing behind
us in pertinency and clearness of [[natural]] understanding.  the astonishing
magnificence of the cities [[city]] of cusco and mexico, and, amongst many other
things, the garden of the [[king]], where all the trees, fruits, and plants,
according to the order and stature they have in a garden, were
excellently formed in gold; as, in his cabinet, were all the animals bred
upon his territory and in its seas; and the [[beauty]] of their manufactures,
in jewels, feathers, cotton, and painting, gave ample proof that they
were as little inferior to us in industry.  but as to what concerns
devotion, observance of the laws [[law]], goodness, liberality, loyalty, and
plain dealing, it was of use to us that we had not so much as they; for
they have lost, sold, and betrayed themselves by this advantage over us.

as to boldness and [[courage]], stability, constancy against [[pain]], [[hunger]],
and [[death]], i should not [[fear]] to oppose the examples [[example]] i find amongst them
to the most famous examples [[example]] of elder times [[time]] that we find in our records on
this side of the [[world]].  far as to those who subdued them, take but away
the tricks and artifices they practised to gull them, and the just
astonishment it was to those nations to see so sudden and unexpected an
arrival of [[men]] with beards, differing in [[language]], [[religion]], shape, and
countenance, from so remote a part of the [[world]], and where they had never
heard there was any habitation, mounted upon [[great]] unknown monsters,
against those who had not only never seen a horse, but had never seen any
other beast trained up to carry a [[man]] or any other loading; shelled in a
hard and shining skin, with a cutting and glittering weapon in his hand,
against them, who, out of wonder at the brightness of a looking glass or
a knife, would exchange [[great]] treasures of gold and pearl; and who had
neither [[knowledge]], nor matter with which, at leisure, they could
penetrate our steel: to which may be added the lightning and thunder of
our cannon and harquebuses, enough to frighten caesar himself, if
surprised, with so little [[experience]], against [[people]] naked, except where
the invention of a little quilted cotton was in use, without other arms,
at the most, than bows, stones, staves, and bucklers of wood; people
surprised under colour of [[friendship]] and [[good]] [[faith]], by the curiosity of
seeing [[strange]] and unknown things; take but away, i say, this disparity
from the conquerors, and you take away all the [[occasion]] of so many
victories.  when i look upon that in vincible ardour wherewith so many
thousands of [[men]], [[women]], and [[children]] so often presented and threw
themselves into inevitable dangers for the defence of their gods and
liberties; that generous obstinacy to suffer all extremities and
difficulties, and [[death]] itself, rather than submit to the dominion of
those by whom they had been so shamefully abused; and some of them
choosing to [[die]] of [[hunger]] and fasting, being prisoners [[prisoner]], rather than to
accept of nourishment from the hands of their so basely victorious
enemies: i see, that whoever would have attacked them upon [[equal]] terms of
arms, [[experience]], and number, would have had a hard, and, peradventure,
a harder game to play than in any other [[war]] we have seen.

why did not so [[noble]] a [[conquest]] fall under alexander, or the ancient
greeks and romans; and so [[great]] a [[revolution]] and mutation of so many
empires and nations, fall into hands that would have gently levelled,
rooted up, and made plain and smooth whatever was rough and savage
amongst them, and that would have cherished and propagated the [[good]] seeds
that [[nature]] had there produced; mixing not only with the [[culture]] of land
and the ornament of cities [[city]], the [[arts]] of this part of the [[world]], in what
was necessary, but also the [[greek]] and roman virtues [[virtue]], with those that were
original of the [[country]]?  what a reparation had it been to them, and what
a general [[good]] to the whole [[world]], had our first examples [[example]] and deportments
in those parts allured those [[people]] to the admiration and imitation of
virtue, and had begotten betwixt them and us a fraternal [[society]] and
intelligence?  how easy had it been to have made advantage of souls [[soul]] so
innocent, and so eager to learn, leaving, for the most part, naturally so
good inclinations before?  whereas, on the contrary, we have taken
advantage of their ignorance and inexperience, with greater ease to
incline them to treachery, luxury, avarice, and towards all sorts of
inhumanity and [[cruelty]], by the pattern and [[example]] of our manners.  who
ever enhanced the price of merchandise at such a rate?  so many cities
levelled with the ground, so many nations exterminated, so many millions
of [[people]] fallen by the edge of the [[sword]], and the richest and most
beautiful part of the [[world]] turned upside down, for the traffic of pearl
and pepper?  mechanic victories!  never did [[ambition]], never did public
animosities, engage [[men]] against one another in such miserable
hostilities, in such miserable calamities.

certain spaniards, coasting the sea in quest of their mines, landed in a
fruitful and pleasant and very well peopled [[country]], and there made to
the inhabitants their accustomed professions: “that they were peaceable
men, who were come from a very remote [[country]], and sent on the behalf of
the [[king]] of castile, the [[greatest]] [[prince]] of the habitable [[world]], to whom
the [[pope]], [[god’s]] vicegerent upon [[earth]], had given the principality of all
the indies; that if they would become tributaries to him, they should be
very gently and courteously used”; at the same [[time]] requiring of them
victuals for their nourishment, and gold whereof to make some pretended
medicine; setting forth, moreover, the [[belief]] in one only [[god]], and the
truth of our [[religion]], which they advised them to embrace, whereunto they
also added some threats.  to which they received this [[answer]]: “that as to
their being peaceable, they did not seem to be such, if they were so.
as to their [[king]], since he was fain to beg, he must be necessitous and
poor; and he who had made him this gift, must be a [[man]] who loved
dissension, to give that to another which was none of his own, to bring
it into dispute against the ancient possessors.  as to victuals, they
would supply them; that of gold they had little; it being a thing they
had in very small esteem, as of no use to the service of [[life]], whereas
their only [[care]] was to pass it over happily and pleasantly: but that what
they could find excepting what was employed in the service of their gods,
they might freely take.  as to one only [[god]], the proposition had pleased
them well; but that they would not [[change]] their [[religion]], both because
they had so long and happily lived in it, and that they were not wont to
take [[advice]] of any but their [[friends]], and those they knew: as to their
menaces, it was a sign of want of [[judgment]] to threaten those whose nature
and [[power]] were to them unknown; that, therefore, they were to make haste
to quit their coast, for they were not used to take the civilities and
professions of armed [[men]] and strangers in [[good]] part; otherwise they
should do by them as they had done by those others,” showing them the
heads of several executed [[men]] round the walls of their [[city]].  a fair
example of the babble of these [[children]].  but so it is, that the
spaniards did not, either in this or in several other places, where they
did not find the merchandise they sought, make any stay or attempt,
whatever other conveniences were there to be had; witness my cannibals.
--[chapter xxx. of [[book]] i.]

of the two most puissant monarchs of that [[world]], and, peradventure, of
this, kings [[king]] of so many kings [[king]], and the [[last]] they turned out, he of peru,
having been taken in a [[battle]], and put to so excessive a ransom as
exceeds all [[belief]], and it being faithfully paid, and he having, by his
conversation, given manifest signs of a frank, liberal, and constant
spirit, and of a clear and settled understanding, the conquerors had a
mind, after having exacted one million three hundred and twenty-five
thousand and five hundred weight of gold, besides silver, and other
things which amounted to no less (so that their horses were shod with
massy gold), still to see, at the price of what disloyalty and injustice
whatever, what the remainder of the treasures of this [[king]] might be, and
to possess themselves of that also.  to this end a false accusation was
preferred against him, and false witnesses brought to prove that he went
about to raise an insurrection in his provinces, to procure his own
liberty; whereupon, by the [[virtuous]] sentence of those very [[men]] who had by
this treachery conspired his ruin, he was condemned to be publicly hanged
and strangled, after having made him buy off the torment of being burnt
alive, by the baptism they gave him immediately before execution; a
horrid and unheard of barbarity, which, nevertheless, he underwent
without giving way either in word or look, with a truly grave and royal
behaviour.  after which, to calm and appease the [[people]], aroused and
astounded at so [[strange]] a thing, they counterfeited [[great]] [[sorrow]] for his
death, and appointed most sumptuous funerals.

the other [[king]] of mexico,--[guatimosin]--having for a long [[time]] defended
his beleaguered [[city]], and having in this siege manifested the utmost of
what suffering and perseverance can do, if ever [[prince]] and [[people]] did,
and his misfortune having delivered him alive into his enemies’ hands,
upon articles of being treated like a [[king]], neither did he in his
captivity discover anything unworthy of that title.  his enemies [[enemy]], after
their [[victory]], not finding so much gold as they expected, when they had
searched and rifled with their utmost diligence, they went about to
procure discoveries by the most cruel torments they could invent upon the
prisoners they had taken: but having profited nothing by these, their
courage being greater than their torments, they arrived at [[last]] to such a
degree of fury, as, contrary to their [[faith]] and the [[law]] of nations, to
condemn the [[king]] himself, and one of the principal noblemen of his court,
to the rack, in the presence of one another.  this [[lord]], finding himself
overcome with [[pain]], being environed with burning coals, pitifully turned
his dying [[eyes]] towards his master, as it were to ask him pardon that he
was able to endure no more; whereupon the [[king]], darting at him a fierce
and severe look, as reproaching his cowardice and pusillanimity, with a
harsh and constant voice said to him thus only: “and what dost thou think
i suffer? am i in a bath? am i more at ease than thou?”  whereupon the
other immediately quailed under the torment and died upon the spot.  the
king, half roasted, was carried thence; not so much out of [[pity]] (for what
compassion ever touched so barbarous souls [[soul]], who, upon the doubtful
information of some vessel of gold to be made a prey of, caused not only
a [[man]], but a [[king]], so [[great]] in [[fortune]] and desert, to be broiled before
their eyes), but because his constancy rendered their [[cruelty]] still more
shameful.  they afterwards [[hanged]] him for having nobly attempted to
deliver himself by arms from so long a captivity and subjection, and he
died with a [[courage]] becoming so magnanimous a [[prince]].

another [[time]], they burnt in the same [[fire]] four hundred and sixty men
alive at once, the four hundred of the [[common]] [[people]], the sixty the
principal lords [[lord]] of a province, simply prisoners [[prisoner]] of [[war]].  we have these
narratives from themselves for they not only own it, but boast of it and
publish it.  could it be for a testimony of their [[justice]] or their zeal
to [[religion]]?  doubtless these are ways too differing and contrary to so
holy an end.  had they proposed to themselves to extend our [[faith]], they
would have considered that it does not amplify in the possession of
territories, but in the gaining of [[men]]; and would have more than
satisfied themselves with the slaughters occasioned by the necessity of
war, without indifferently mixing a massacre, as upon wild beasts, as
universal as [[fire]] and [[sword]] could make it; having only, by intention,
saved so many as they meant to make miserable slaves [[slave]] of, for the [[work]] and
service of their mines; so that many of the captains were put to death
upon the place of [[conquest]], by order of the kings [[king]] of castile, justly
offended with the [[horror]] of their deportment, and almost all of them
hated and disesteemed.  [[god]] meritoriously permitted that all this great
plunder should be swallowed up by the sea in transportation, or in the
civil wars [[war]] wherewith they devoured one another; and most of the men
themselves were buried in a [[foreign]] [[land]] without any fruit of their
victory.

that the [[revenue]] from these countries [[country]], though in the hands of so
parsimonious and so prudent a [[prince]],--[phillip ii.]--so little answers
the expectation given of it to his predecessors, and to that original
abundance of riches [[rich]] which was found at the first landing in those new
discovered countries [[country]] (for though a [[great]] deal be fetched thence, yet we
see ‘tis nothing in comparison of that which might be expected), is that
the use of coin was there utterly unknown, and that consequently their
gold was found all hoarded together, being of no other use but for
ornament and show, as a furniture reserved from [[father]] to [[son]] by many
puissant kings [[king]], who were ever draining their mines to make this vast heap
of vessels and statues for the decoration of their palaces and temples;
whereas our gold is always in motion and traffic; we cut it into a
thousand small pieces, and cast it into a thousand forms, and scatter and
disperse it in a thousand ways.  but suppose our kings [[king]] should thus hoard
up all the gold they could get in several ages [[age]] and let it [[lie]] idle by
them.

those of the [[kingdom]] of mexico were in some sort more civilised and more
advanced in [[arts]] than the other nations about them.  therefore did they
judge, as we do, that the [[world]] was near its period, and looked upon the
desolation we brought amongst them as a [[certain]] sign of it.  they
believed that the existence of the [[world]] was divided into five ages [[age]], and
in the [[life]] of five successive suns, of which four had already ended
their [[time]], and that this which gave them [[light]] was the fifth.  the first
perished, with all other creatures, by an universal inundation of water;
the second by the heavens [[heaven]] falling upon us and suffocating every living
thing to which [[age]] they assigned the giants, and showed bones to the
spaniards, according to the proportion of which the stature of men
amounted to twenty feet; the third by [[fire]], which burned and consumed
all; the fourth by an emotion of the air and wind, which came with such
violence as to beat down even many mountains, wherein the [[men]] died not,
but were turned into baboons.  what impressions will not the weakness of
human [[belief]] admit?  after the [[death]] of this fourth sun, the [[world]] was
twenty-five years in perpetual darkness: in the fifteenth of which a man
and a woman were created, who restored the [[human]] [[race]]: ten years after,
upon a [[certain]] day, the sun appeared newly created, and since the account
of their year takes beginning from that day: the third day after its
creation the ancient gods died, and the new ones were since born daily.
after what manner they [[think]] this [[last]] sun shall perish, my author knows
not; but their number of this fourth [[change]] agrees with the great
conjunction of stars which eight hundred and odd years ago, as
astrologers suppose, produced [[great]] alterations and novelties in the
world.

as to pomp and magnificence, upon the account of which i engaged in this
discourse, neither greece, [[rome]], nor [[egypt]], whether for utility,
difficulty, or [[state]], can compare any of their works [[work]] with the highway to
be seen in peru, made by the kings [[king]] of the [[country]], from the [[city]] of quito
to that of cusco (three hundred leagues), straight, even, five-and-twenty
paces wide, paved, and provided on both sides with high and beautiful
walls; and close by them, and all along on the inside, two perennial
streams, bordered with beautiful plants, which they call moly.  in this
work, where they met with rocks and mountains, they cut them through, and
made them even, and filled up pits and valleys with lime and stone to
make them level.  at the end of every day’s [[journey]] are beautiful
palaces, furnished with provisions, vestments, and arms, as well for
travellers as for the armies [[army]] that are to pass that way.  in the estimate
of this [[work]] i have reckoned the difficulty which is especially
considerable in that place; they did not build with any stones less than
ten feet square, and had no other conveniency of carriage but by drawing
their load themselves by [[force]] of arm, and knew not so much as the art [[arts]] of
scaffolding, nor any other way of standing to their [[work]], but by throwing
up [[earth]] against the building as it rose higher, taking it away again
when they had done.

let us here return to our coaches.  instead of these, and of all other
sorts of carriages, they caused themselves to be carried upon men’s
shoulders.  this [[last]] [[king]] of peru, the day that he was taken, was thus
carried betwixt two upon staves of gold, and set in a chair of gold in
the middle of his [[army]].  as many of these sedan-men as were killed to
make him fall (for they would take him alive), so many others (and they
contended for it) took the place of those who were slain, so that they
could never beat him down, what slaughter soever they made of these
people, till a horseman, seizing upon him, brought him to the ground.




chapter vii

of the inconvenience of greatness

since we cannot attain unto it, let us [[revenge]] our selves by railing at
it; and yet it is not absolutely railing against anything to proclaim its
defects, because they are in all things to be found, how beautiful or how
much to be coveted soever.  greatness has, in general, this manifest
advantage, that it can lower itself when it pleases, and has, very near,
the [[choice]] of both the one and the other condition; for a [[man]] does not
fall from all heights; there are several from which one may descend
without falling down.  it does, indeed, appear to me that we value it at
too high a rate, and also overvalue the resolution of those whom we have
either seen or heard have contemned it, or displaced themselves of their
own accord: its essence is not so evidently commodious that a [[man]] may
not, with out a miracle, refuse it.  i find it a very hard thing to
undergo misfortunes, but to be content with a moderate measure of
fortune, and to avoid greatness, i [[think]] a very easy matter.  ‘tis,
methinks, a [[virtue]] to which i, who am no conjuror, could without any
great endeavour arrive.  what, then, is to be expected from them that
would yet put into consideration the [[glory]] attending this refusal,
wherein there may lurk worse [[ambition]] than even in the [[desire]] itself,
and fruition of greatness?  forasmuch as [[ambition]] never comports itself
better, according to itself, than when it proceeds by obscure and
unfrequented ways.

i incite my [[courage]] to patience, but i rein it as much as i can towards
desire.  i have as much to [[wish]] for as another, and allow my wishes [[wish]] as
much [[liberty]] and indiscretion; but yet it never befell me to [[wish]] for
either [[empire]] or royalty, or the eminency of those high and commanding
fortunes: i do not aim that way; i [[love]] myself too well.  when i [[think]] to
grow greater, ‘tis but very moderately, and by a compelled and timorous
advancement, such as is proper for me in resolution, in prudence, in
health, in [[beauty]], and even in riches [[rich]] too; but this supreme [[reputation]],
this mighty [[authority]], [[oppress]] my [[imagination]]; and, quite contrary to
that other,--[julius caesar.]--i should, peradventure, rather choose to
be the second or third in perigord than the first at [[paris]] at least,
without lying, rather the third at [[paris]] than the first.  i would neither
dispute with a porter, a miserable unknown, nor make crowds open in
adoration as i pass.  i am trained up to a moderate condition, as well by
my [[choice]] as [[fortune]]; and have made it appear, in the whole conduct of my
life and enterprises, that i have rather avoided than otherwise the
climbing above the [[degree]] of [[fortune]] wherein [[god]] has placed me by my
birth; all [[natural]] [[constitution]] is equally just and easy.  my [[soul]] is
such a poltroon, that i measure not [[good]] [[fortune]] by the height, but by
the facility.

but if my [[heart]] be not [[great]] enough, ‘tis open enough to make amends, at
any one’s request, freely to lay open its weakness.  should any one put
me upon comparing the [[life]] of l. thorius balbus, a brave [[man]], handsome,
learned, healthful, understanding, and abounding in all sorts of
conveniences and pleasures [[pleasure]], leading a quiet [[life]], and all his own, his
mind well prepared against [[death]], superstition, [[pain]], and other
incumbrances of [[human]] necessity, dying, at [[last]], in [[battle]], with his
sword in his hand, for the defence of his [[country]], on the one part; and
on the other part, the [[life]] of m. regulus, so [[great]] and high as is known
to every one, and his end admirable; the one without name and without
dignity, the other exemplary and glorious to a wonder.  i should
doubtless say, as cicero did, could i speak as well as he.

     [cicero, de finibus, ii. 20, gives the preference to regulus, and
     proclaims him the happier [[man]].]

but if i was to compare them with my own, i should then also say that the
first is as much according to my capacity, and from [[desire]], which i
conform to my capacity, as the second is far beyond it; that i could not
approach the [[last]] but with veneration, the other i could readily attain
by use.

let us return to our temporal greatness, from which we are digressed.  i
disrelish all dominion, whether active or passive.  otanes, one of the
seven who had [[right]] to pretend to the [[kingdom]] of [[persia]], did as i should
willingly have done, which was, that he gave up to his competitors his
right of being promoted to it, either by election or by lot, provided
that he and his might [[live]] in the [[empire]] out of all [[authority]] and
subjection, those of the ancient laws [[law]] excepted, and might enjoy all
liberty that was not prejudicial to these, being as impatient of
commanding as of being commanded.

the most painful and difficult employment in the [[world]], in my [[opinion]], is
worthily to discharge the office of a [[king]].  i excuse more of their
mistakes than [[men]] commonly do, in consideration of the intolerable weight
of their function, which astounds me.  ‘tis hard to keep measure in so
immeasurable a [[power]]; yet so it is that it is, even to those who are not
of the [[best]] [[nature]], a singular incitement to [[virtue]] to be seated in a
place where you cannot do the least [[good]] that shall not be put upon
record, and where the least benefit redounds to so many [[men]], and where
your talent of administration, like that of preachers, principally
addresses itself to the [[people]], no very exact [[judge]], easy to [[deceive]], and
easily content.  there are few things wherein we can give a sincere
judgment, by [[reason]] that there are few wherein we have not, in some sort,
a private interest.  superiority and inferiority, dominion and subjection
are bound to a [[natural]] envy and contest, and must of necessity
perpetually intrench upon one another.  i [[believe]] neither the one nor the
other touching the rights [[right]] of the other party; let [[reason]] therefore, which
is inflexible and without passion, determine when we can avail ourselves
of it.  ‘tis not above a month ago that i [[read]] over, two scottish authors
contending upon this [[subject]], of whom he who stands for the [[people]] makes
the [[king]] to be in a worse condition than a carter; he who writes for
monarchy places him some degrees [[degree]] above [[god]] in [[power]] and sovereignty.

now, the incommodity of greatness that i have taken to remark in this
place, upon some [[occasion]] that has lately put it into my head, is this:
there is not, peradventure, anything more pleasant in the commerce of
many than the trials that we make against one another, out of emulation
of [[honour]] and worth, whether in the exercises of the [[body]] or in those of
the [[mind]], wherein [[sovereign]] greatness can have no true part.  and, in
earnest, i have often [[thought]] that by [[force]] of [[respect]] itself [[men]] use
princes disdainfully and injuriously in that particular; for the thing i
was infinitely offended at in my [[childhood]], that they who exercised with
me forbore to do their [[best]] because they found me unworthy of their
utmost endeavour, is what we see happen to them daily, every one finding
himself unworthy to contend with them.  if we discover that they have the
least [[desire]] to get the [[better]] of us, there is no one who will not make
it his [[business]] to give it them, and who will not rather betray his own
glory than offend theirs; and will therein employ so much [[force]] only as
is necessary to save their [[honour]].  what share have they, then, in the
engagement, where every one is on their side?  methinks i see those
paladins of ancient times [[time]] presenting themselves to jousts and [[battle]] with
enchanted arms and bodies [[body]].  brisson,

     [plutarch, on satisfaction or tranquillity of the [[mind]].  but in his
     essay, how a [[man]] may distinguish a flatterer from a friend, he calls
     him chriso.]

running against alexander, purposely missed his blow, and made a [[fault]] in
his [[career]]; alexander chid him for it, but he ought to have had him
whipped.  upon this consideration carneades said, that “the sons [[son]] of
princes learned nothing [[right]] but to manage horses; by [[reason]] that, in
all their other exercises, every one bends and yields to them; but a
horse, that is neither a flatterer nor a courtier, throws the [[son]] of a
king with no more [[ceremony]] than he would throw that of a porter.”

homer was fain to [[consent]] that [[venus]], so sweet and delicate a [[goddess]] as
she was, should be wounded at the [[battle]] of troy, thereby to ascribe
courage and boldness to her qualities that cannot possibly be in those
who are exempt from danger.  the gods are made to be angry, to [[fear]], to
run away, to be [[jealous]], to grieve, to be transported with [[passions]], to
honour them with the virtues [[virtue]] that, amongst us, are built upon these
imperfections. who does not participate in the hazard and difficulty, can
claim no interest in the [[honour]] and [[pleasure]] that are the consequents of
hazardous actions.  ‘tis [[pity]] a [[man]] should be so potent that all things
must give way to him; [[fortune]] therein sets you too remote from [[society]],
and places you in too [[great]] a solitude.  this easiness and mean facility
of making all things bow under you, is an [[enemy]] to all sorts of [[pleasure]]:
‘tis to slide, not to go; ‘tis to sleep, and not to [[live]].  conceive man
accompanied with omnipotence: you overwhelm him; he must beg disturbance
and opposition as an alms: his being and his [[good]] are in indigence. evil
to [[man]] is in its turn [[good]], and [[good]] [[evil]]. neither is [[pain]] always to be
shunned, nor [[pleasure]] always to be pursued.

their [[good]] qualities are [[dead]] and lost; for they can only be perceived by
comparison, and we put them out of this: they have little [[knowledge]] of
true [[praise]], having their ears deafened with so continual and uniform an
approbation.  have they to do with the stupidest of all their subjects [[subject]]?
they have no means to take any advantage of him; if he but say: “‘tis
because he is my [[king]],” he thinks [[think]] he has said enough to express that he
therefore [[suffered]] himself to be overcome.  this quality stifles and
consumes the other true and essential qualities: they are sunk in the
royalty, and leave them nothing to recommend themselves with but actions
that directly concern and serve the function of their place; ‘tis so much
to be a [[king]], that this alone remains to them.  the outer glare that
environs him conceals and shrouds him from us; our sight is there
repelled and dissipated, being filled and stopped by this prevailing
light.  the senate awarded the prize of eloquence to tiberius; he refused
it, esteeming that though it had been just, he could derive no advantage
from a [[judgment]] so partial, and that was so little [[free]] to [[judge]].

as we give them all advantages of [[honour]], so do we soothe and authorise
all their vices [[vice]] and defects, not only by approbation, but by imitation
also.  every one of alexander’s followers carried his head on one side,
as he did; and the flatterers of dionysius ran against one another in his
presence, and stumbled at and overturned whatever was under foot, to shew
they were as purblind as he.  hernia itself has also served to recommend
a [[man]] to favour; i have seen deafness affected; and because the master
hated his [[wife]], plutarch--[who, however, only gives one instance; and in
this he tells us that the [[man]] visited his [[wife]] privately.]--has seen his
courtiers repudiate theirs, whom they loved; and, which is yet more,
uncleanliness and all manner of dissoluteness have so been in [[fashion]]; as
also disloyalty, blasphemy, [[cruelty]], heresy, superstition, irreligion,
effeminacy, and worse, if worse there be; and by an [[example]] yet more
dangerous than that of mithridates’ flatterers, who, as their master
pretended to the [[honour]] of a [[good]] physician, came to him to have
incisions and cauteries made in their limbs; for these others suffered
the [[soul]], a more delicate and [[noble]] part, to be cauterised.

but to end where i began: the [[emperor]] adrian, disputing with the
philosopher favorinus about the interpretation of some word, favorinus
soon yielded him the [[victory]]; for which his [[friends]] rebuking him, “you
talk simply,” said he; “would you not have him wiser than i, who commands
thirty legions?”  augustus wrote verses against asinius pollio, and “i,”
 said pollio, “say nothing, for it is not prudence to write in contest
with him who has [[power]] to proscribe.”  and they were [[right]].  for
dionysius, because he could not [[equal]] philoxenus in poesy and [[plato]] in
discourse, condemned the one to the quarries, and sent the other to be
sold for a [[slave]] into the island of aegina.




chapter viii

of the art [[arts]] of conference

‘tis a custom of our [[justice]] to condemn some for a warning to others.  to
condemn them for having done amiss, were folly, as [[plato]] says,

     [diogenes laertius, however, in his [[life]] of [[plato]], iii. 181, says
     that plato’s offence was the speaking too freely to the [[tyrant]].]

for what is done can never be undone; but ‘tis to the end they may offend
no more, and that others may avoid the [[example]] of their offence: we do
not [[correct]] the [[man]] we hang; we [[correct]] others by him.  i do the same; my
errors are sometimes [[natural]], incorrigible, and irremediable: but the
good which [[virtuous]] [[men]] do to the [[public]], in making themselves imitated,
i, peradventure, may do in making my manners avoided:

         “nonne vides, albi ut male vivat filius? utque
          barrus inops?  magnum documentum, ne patriam rein
          perdere guis velit;”

     [“dost thou not see how ill the [[son]] of albus lives [[life]]?  and how the
     indigent barrus? a [[great]] warning lest any one should incline to
     dissipate his patrimony.”--horace, sat., i. 4, 109.]

publishing and accusing my own imperfections, some one will learn to be
afraid of them.  the parts that i most esteem in myself, derive more
honour from decrying, than for commending myself which is the [[reason]] why
i so often fall into, and so much insist upon that strain.  but, when all
is summed up, a [[man]] never speaks of himself without loss; a man’s
accusations of himself are always believed; his praises [[praise]] never: there may,
peradventure, be some of my own [[complexion]] who [[better]] instruct myself by
contrariety than by similitude, and by avoiding than by imitation.  the
elder cato was regarding this sort of discipline, when he said, “that the
wise may learn more of fools [[fool]], than fools [[fool]] can of the wise”; and pausanias
tells us of an ancient player upon the harp, who was wont to make his
scholars go to hear one who played very ill, who lived over against him,
that they might learn to hate his discords and false measures.  the
horror of [[cruelty]] more inclines me to clemency, than any [[example]] of
clemency could possibly do.  a [[good]] rider does not so much mend my seat,
as an awkward attorney or a venetian, on horseback; and a clownish way of
speaking more reforms mine than the most [[correct]].  the ridiculous and
simple look of another always warns and advises me; that which pricks,
rouses and incites much [[better]] than that which tickles.  the [[time]] is now
proper for us to reform backward; more by dissenting than by agreeing; by
differing more than by [[consent]].  profiting little by [[good]] examples [[example]], i
make use of those that are ill, which are everywhere to be found: i
endeavour to render myself as agreeable as i see others offensive; as
constant as i see others fickle; as affable as i see others rough; as
good as i see others [[evil]]: but i propose to myself impracticable
measures.

the most fruitful and [[natural]] exercise of the [[mind]], in my [[opinion]], is
conversation; i find the use of it more sweet than of any other action of
life; and for that [[reason]] it is that, if i were now compelled to choose,
i should sooner, i [[think]], [[consent]] to lose my sight, than my hearing and
speech.  the athenians, and also the romans, kept this exercise in great
honour in their academies; the italians retain some traces of it to this
day, to their [[great]] advantage, as is manifest by the comparison of our
understandings with theirs.  the study of books [[book]] is a languishing and
feeble motion that heats not, whereas conversation teaches [[teach]] and exercises
at once.  if i converse with a [[strong]] [[mind]] and a rough disputant, he
presses upon my flanks, and pricks me [[right]] and left; his imaginations
stir up mine; [[jealousy]], [[glory]], and contention, stimulate and raise me up
to something above myself; and acquiescence is a quality altogether
tedious in discourse.  but, as our [[mind]] fortifies itself by the
communication of vigorous and regular understandings, ‘tis not to be
expressed how much it loses and degenerates by the continual commerce and
familiarity we have with mean and [[weak]] spirits; there is no contagion
that spreads like that; i [[know]] sufficiently by [[experience]] what ‘tis worth
a yard.  i [[love]] to discourse and dispute, but it is with but few [[men]], and
for myself; for to do it as a spectacle and entertainment to great
persons, and to make of a man’s wit and words competitive parade is, in
my [[opinion]], very unbecoming a [[man]] of [[honour]].

folly is a [[bad]] quality; but not to be able to endure it, to fret and vex
at it, as i do, is another sort of disease little less troublesome than
folly itself; and is the thing that i will now accuse in myself.  i enter
into conference, and dispute with [[great]] [[liberty]] and facility, forasmuch
as [[opinion]] meets in me with a soil very unfit for penetration, and
wherein to take any deep root; no propositions astonish me, no belief
offends me, though never so contrary to my own; there is no so frivolous
and extravagant fancy that does not seem to me suitable to the production
of [[human]] wit.  we, who deprive our [[judgment]] of the [[right]] of determining,
look indifferently upon the diverse opinions [[opinion]], and if we incline not our
judgment to them, yet we easily give them the hearing: where one scale is
totally empty, i let the other waver under an old wife’s dreams [[dream]]; and i
think myself excusable, if i prefer the odd number; thursday rather than
friday; if i had rather be the twelfth or fourteenth than the thirteenth
at table; if i had rather, on a [[journey]], see a hare run by me than cross
my way, and rather give my [[man]] my left foot than my [[right]], when he comes
to put on my stockings.  all such reveries as are in credit around us,
deserve at least a hearing: for my part, they only with me import
inanity, but they import that.  moreover, vulgar and casual opinions [[opinion]] are
something more than nothing in [[nature]]; and he who will not suffer himself
to proceed so far, falls, peradventure, into the [[vice]] of obstinacy, to
avoid that of superstition.

the contradictions of judgments [[judgment]], then, neither offend nor alter, they
only rouse and exercise, me. we evade correction, whereas we ought to
offer and [[present]] ourselves to it, especially when it appears in the form
of conference, and not of [[authority]].  at every opposition, we do not
consider whether or no it be dust, but, [[right]] or [[wrong]], how to disengage
ourselves: instead of extending the arms, we thrust out our claws.  i
could suffer myself to be rudely handled by my friend, so much as to tell
me that i am a [[fool]], and talk i [[know]] not of what.  i [[love]] stout
expressions amongst gentle [[men]], and to have them speak as they [[think]]; we
must fortify and harden our hearing against this tenderness of the
ceremonious sound of words. i [[love]] a [[strong]] and manly familiarity and
conversation: a [[friendship]] that pleases itself in the sharpness and
vigour of its communication, like [[love]] in biting and scratching: it is
not vigorous and generous enough, if it be not quarrelsome, if it be
civilised and artificial, if it treads nicely and fears [[fear]] the shock:

       “neque enim disputari sine reprehensione potest.”

     [“neither can a [[man]] dispute, but he must contradict.”
      (or:) “nor can [[people]] dispute without reprehension.”
      --cicero, de finib., i. 8.]

when any one contradicts me, he raises my attention, not my anger: i
advance towards him who controverts, who instructs me; the cause of truth
ought to be the [[common]] cause both of the one and the other.  what will
the angry [[man]] [[answer]]?  passion has already confounded his [[judgment]];
agitation has usurped the place of [[reason]].  it were not amiss that the
decision of our disputes should pass by wager: that there might be a
material mark of our losses, to the end we might the [[better]] remember
them; and that my [[man]] might tell me: “your ignorance and obstinacy cost
you [[last]] year, at several times [[time]], a hundred crowns [[crown]].”  i hail and caress
truth in what quarter soever i find it, and cheerfully [[surrender]] myself,
and open my conquered arms as far off as i can discover it; and, provided
it be not too imperiously, take a [[pleasure]] in being reproved, and
accommodate myself to my accusers, very often more by [[reason]] of civility
than amendment, loving to gratify and nourish the [[liberty]] of admonition
by my facility of submitting to it, and this even at my own expense.

nevertheless, it is hard to bring the [[men]] of my [[time]] to it: they have not
the [[courage]] to [[correct]], because they have not the [[courage]] to suffer
themselves to be corrected; and speak always with dissimulation in the
presence of one another: i take so [[great]] a [[pleasure]] in being judged and
known, that it is almost indifferent to me in which of the two forms i am
so: my [[imagination]] so often contradicts and condemns itself, that ‘tis
all one to me if another do it, especially considering that i give his
reprehension no greater [[authority]] than i choose; but i break with him,
who carries himself so high, as i [[know]] of one who repents his [[advice]],
if not believed, and takes it for an affront if it be not immediately
followed.  that [[socrates]] always received smilingly the contradictions
offered to his arguments, a [[man]] may say arose from his [[strength]] of
reason; and that, the advantage being [[certain]] to fall on his side, he
accepted them as a matter of new [[victory]].  but we see, on the contrary,
that nothing in argument renders our sentiment so delicate, as the
opinion of pre-eminence, and disdain of the adversary; and that, in
reason, ‘tis rather for the weaker to take in [[good]] part the oppositions
that [[correct]] him and set him [[right]].  in earnest, i rather choose the
company of those who ruffle me than of those who [[fear]] me; ‘tis a dull and
hurtful [[pleasure]] to have to do with [[people]] who [[admire]] us and approve of
all we say.  antisthenes commanded his [[children]] never to take it kindly
or for a favour, when any [[man]] commended them.  i find i am much prouder
of the [[victory]] i obtain over myself, when, in the very ardour of dispute,
i make myself submit to my adversary’s [[force]] of [[reason]], than i am pleased
with the [[victory]] i obtain over him through his weakness.  in fine, i
receive and admit of all manner of attacks that are direct, how weak
soever; but i am too impatient of those that are made out of form.  i
care not what the [[subject]] is, the opinions [[opinion]] are to me all one, and i am
almost indifferent whether i get the [[better]] or the worse.  i can
peaceably argue a whole day together, if the argument be carried on with
method; i do not so much require [[force]] and subtlety as order; i mean the
order which we every day observe in the wranglings of shepherds and
shop-boys, but never amongst us: if they start from their [[subject]], ‘tis
out of incivility, and so ‘tis with us; but their tumult and impatience
never put them out of their theme; their argument still continues its
course; if they interrupt, and do not stay for one another, they at least
understand one another.  any one answers [[answer]] too well for me, if he answers
what i say: when the dispute is irregular and disordered, i leave the
thing itself, and insist upon the form with anger and indiscretion;
falling into wilful, malicious, and imperious way of disputation, of
which i am afterwards ashamed.  ‘tis impossible to deal fairly with a
fool: my [[judgment]] is not only corrupted under the hand of so impetuous a
master, but my [[conscience]] also.

our disputes ought to be interdicted and punished as well as other verbal
crimes: what [[vice]] do they not raise and heap up, being always governed
and commanded by passion?  we first quarrel with their reasons [[reason]], and then
with the [[men]].  we only learn to dispute that we may contradict; and so,
every one contradicting and being contradicted, it falls out that the
fruit of disputation is to lose and annihilate [[truth]].  therefore it is
that [[plato]] in his [[republic]] prohibits this exercise to fools [[fool]] and ill-bred
people.  to what end do you go about to inquire of him, who knows [[know]] nothing
to the [[purpose]]?  a [[man]] does no injury to the [[subject]], when he leaves it
to seek how he may treat it; i do not mean by an artificial and
scholastic way, but by a [[natural]] one, with a sound understanding.  what
will it be in the end?  one flies to the east, the other to the west;
they lose the principal, dispersing it in the crowd of incidents after an
hour of tempest, they [[know]] not what they seek: one is low, the other
high, and a third wide.  one catches at a word and a simile; another is
no longer sensible of what is said in opposition to him, and thinks [[think]] only
of going on at his own rate, not of answering you: another, finding
himself too [[weak]] to make [[good]] his rest, fears [[fear]] all, refuses all, at the
very beginning, confounds the [[subject]]; or, in the very height of the
dispute, stops short and is silent, by a peevish ignorance affecting a
proud contempt or a foolishly  modest avoidance of further debate:
provided this [[man]] strikes, he cares [[care]] not how much he lays himself open;
the other counts his words, and weighs them for reasons [[reason]]; another only
brawls, and uses the advantage of his lungs.  here’s one who learnedly
concludes against himself, and another who deafens you with prefaces and
senseless digressions: an other falls into downright railing, and seeks a
quarrel after the [[german]] [[fashion]], to disengage himself from a wit that
presses too hard upon him: and a [[last]] [[man]] sees nothing into the [[reason]] of
the thing, but draws a line of circumvallation about you of dialectic
clauses, and the formulas of his art [[arts]].

now, who would not enter into distrust of sciences [[science]], and [[doubt]] whether he
can reap from them any solid fruit for the service of [[life]], considering
the use we put them to?

                    “nihil sanantibus litteris.”

          [“letters which cure nothing.”--seneca, ep., 59.]

who has got understanding by his [[logic]]?  where are all her [[fair]] promises?

          “nec ad melius vivendum, nec ad commodius disserendum.”

          [“it neither makes a [[man]] [[live]] [[better]] nor talk [[better]].”
           --cicero, de fin., i. 19.]

is there more noise or confusion in the scolding of herring-wives than in
the [[public]] disputes of [[men]] of this profession?  i had rather my son
should learn in a tap-house to speak, than in the schools to prate.  take
a master of [[arts]], and confer with him: why does he not make us sensible
of this artificial excellence? and why does he not captivate [[women]] and
ignoramuses, as we are, with admiration at the steadiness of his reasons
and the [[beauty]] of his order? why does he not sway and persuade us to what
he will? why does a [[man]], who has so much advantage in matter and
treatment, mix railing, indiscretion, and fury in his disputations?
strip him of his gown, his hood, and his latin, let him not batter our
ears with [[aristotle]], pure and simple, you will take him for one of us,
or worse.  whilst they torment us with this complication and confusion of
words, it fares with them, methinks, as with jugglers; their dexterity
imposes upon our senses, but does not at all [[work]] upon our [[belief]] this
legerdemain excepted, they perform nothing that is not very ordinary and
mean: for being the more learned, they are none the less fools [[fool]].

     [so hobbes said that if he had [[read]] as much as the academical
     pedants he should have known as little.]

i [[love]] and [[honour]] [[knowledge]] as much as they that have it, and in its true
use ‘tis the most [[noble]] and the [[greatest]] acquisition of [[men]]; but in such
as i speak of (and the number of them is infinite), who build their
fundamental sufficiency and value upon it, who appeal from their
understanding to their memory:

                    “sub aliena umbra latentes,”

     [“sheltering under the shadow of others.”--seneca, ep., 33.]

and who can do nothing but by [[book]], i hate it, if i dare to say so, worse
than stupidity.  in my [[country]], and in my [[time]], learning improves
fortunes enough, but not minds [[mind]]; if it meet with those that are dull and
heavy, it overcharges and suffocates them, leaving them a crude and
undigested mass; if airy and fine, it purifies, clarifies, and subtilises
them, even to exinanition.  ‘tis a thing of almost indifferent quality;
a very useful accession to a well-born [[soul]], but hurtful and pernicious
to others; or rather a thing of very precious use, that will not suffer
itself to be purchased at an under rate; in the hand of some ‘tis a
sceptre, in that of others a fool’s bauble.

but let us proceed.  what greater [[victory]] do you expect than to make your
enemy see and [[know]] that he is not able to encounter you?  when you get
the [[better]] of your argument; ‘tis [[truth]] that wins; when you get the
advantage of form and method, ‘tis then you who [[win]].  i am of [[opinion]] that
in, [[plato]] and xenophon [[socrates]] disputes more in favour of the disputants
than in favour of the dispute, and more to instruct euthydemus and
protagoras in the, [[knowledge]] of their impertinence, than in the
impertinence of their art [[arts]].  he takes hold of the first [[subject]] like one
who has a more profitable end than to explain it--namely, to clear the
understandings that he takes upon him to instruct and exercise.  to hunt
after [[truth]] is properly our [[business]], and we are inexcusable if we carry
on the chase impertinently and ill; to fail of seizing it is another
thing, for we are born to inquire after [[truth]]: it belongs to a greater
power to possess it.  it is not, as democritus said, hid in the bottom of
the deeps, but rather elevated to an infinite height in the divine
knowledge.  the [[world]] is but a school of inquisition: it is not who shall
enter the ring, but who shall run the [[best]] courses.  he may as well play
the [[fool]] who speaks true, as he who speaks false, for we are upon the
manner, not the matter, of speaking.  ‘tis my [[humour]] as much to regard
the form as the substance, and the advocate as much as the cause, as
alcibiades ordered we should: and every day pass away my [[time]] in reading
authors without any consideration of their learning; their manner is what
i look after, not their [[subject]]: and just so do i hunt after the
conversation of any eminent wit, not that he may [[teach]] me, but that i may
know him, and that knowing him, if i [[think]] him worthy of imitation, i may
imitate him.  every [[man]] may speak truly, but to speak methodically,
prudently, and fully, is a talent that few [[men]] have.  the falsity that
proceeds from ignorance does not offend me, but the foppery of it.  i
have broken off several treaties  that would have been of advantage to
me, by [[reason]] of the impertinent contestations of those with whom i
treated.  i am not moved once in a year at the faults [[fault]] of those over whom
i have [[authority]], but upon the account of the ridiculous obstinacy of
their allegations, denials, excuses, we are every day going together by
the ears; they neither [[understand]] what is said, nor why, and answer
accordingly; ‘tis enough to drive a [[man]] mad.  i never [[feel]] any hurt upon
my head but when ‘tis knocked against another, and more easily forgive
the vices [[vice]] of my servants than their boldness, importunity, and folly; let
them do less, provided they [[understand]] what they do: you [[live]] in [[hope]] to
warm their affection to your service, but there is nothing to be had or
to be expected from a stock.

but what, if i take things otherwise than they are?  perhaps i do; and
therefore it is that i accuse my own [[impatience]], and hold, in the first
place, that it is equally vicious both in him that is in the [[right]], and
in him that is in the [[wrong]]; for ‘tis always a tyrannic sourness not to
endure a form contrary to one’s own: and, besides, there cannot, in
truth, be a greater, more constant, nor more irregular folly than to be
moved and angry at the follies of the [[world]], for it principally makes us
quarrel with ourselves; and the old philosopher never wanted an occasion
for his tears whilst he considered himself.  miso, one of the seven
sages, of a timonian and democritic [[humour]], being [[asked]],  “what he
laughed at, being alone?”--“that i do laugh alone,” answered he.  how
many ridiculous things, in my own [[opinion]], do i say and [[answer]] every day
that comes over my head?  and then how many more, according to the
opinion of others?  if i bite my own lips, what ought others to do?  in
fine, we must [[live]] amongst the living, and let the river run under the
bridge without our [[care]], or, at least, without our interference.  in
truth, why do we meet a [[man]] with a hunch-back, or any other deformity,
without being moved, and cannot endure the encounter of a deformed mind
without being angry?  this vicious sourness sticks more to the [[judge]] than
to the crime.  let us always have this saying of [[plato]] in our mouths: “do
not i [[think]] things unsound, because i am not sound in myself?  am i not
myself in [[fault]]?  may not my observations reflect upon myself?”--a wise
and [[divine]] saying, that lashes the most universal and [[common]] error of
mankind.  not only the reproaches that we throw in the face of one
another, but our reasons [[reason]] also, our arguments and controversies, are
reboundable upon us, and we wound ourselves with our own [[weapons]]: of
which antiquity has left me enough grave examples [[example]].  it was ingeniously
and home-said by him, who was the inventor of this sentence:

                    “stercus cuique suum bene olet.”

          [“to every [[man]] his own excrements smell well.”--erasmus]

we see nothing behind us; we mock ourselves an hundred times [[time]] a day; when
we deride our neighbours; and we detest in others the defects which are
more manifest in us, and which we [[admire]] with marvellous inadvertency and
impudence.  it was but yesterday that i heard a [[man]] of understanding and
of [[good]] rank, as pleasantly as justly scoffing at the folly of another,
who did nothing but torment everybody with the catalogue of his genealogy
and alliances, above half of them false (for they are most apt to fall
into such ridiculous discourses, whose qualities are most dubious and
least sure), and yet, would he have looked into himself, he would have
discerned himself to be no less intemperate and wearisome in extolling
his wife’s pedigree.  o importunate presumption, with which the [[wife]] sees
herself armed by the hands of her own husband.  did he [[understand]] latin,
we should say to him:

          “age, si hic non insanit satis sua sponte, instiga.”

     [“come!  if of himself he is not mad enough, urge him on.”
      --terence, and., iv. 2, 9.]

i do not say that no [[man]] should accuse another, who is not clean
himself,--for then no one would ever accuse,--clean from the same sort of
spot; but i mean that our [[judgment]], falling upon another who is then in
question, should not, at the same [[time]], spare ourselves, but sentence us
with an inward and severe [[authority]].  ‘tis an office of charity, that he
who cannot reclaim himself from a [[vice]], should, nevertheless, endeavour
to remove it from another, in whom, peradventure, it may not have so deep
and so malignant a root; neither do him who reproves me for my [[fault]] that
he himself is guilty of the same.  what of that?  the reproof is,
notwithstanding, true and of very [[good]] use.  had we a [[good]] nose, our own
ordure would stink worse to us, forasmuch as it is our own: and socrates
is of [[opinion]] that whoever should find himself, his [[son]], and a stranger
guilty of any [[violence]] and [[wrong]], ought to begin with himself, present
himself first to the sentence of [[justice]], and implore, to purge himself,
the assistance of the hand of the executioner; in the next place, he
should proceed to his [[son]], and lastly, to the stranger.  if this precept
seem too severe, he ought at least to [[present]] himself the first, to the
punishment of his own [[conscience]].

the senses are our first and proper judges [[judge]], which perceive not things but
by external accidents; and ‘tis no wonder, if in all the parts of the
service of our [[society]], there is so perpetual and universal a mixture of
ceremonies and superficial appearances; insomuch that the [[best]] and most
effectual part of our polities therein consist.  ‘tis still [[man]] with whom
we have to do, of whom the condition is wonderfully corporal.  let those
who, of these late years, would erect for us such a contemplative and
immaterial an exercise of [[religion]], not wonder if there be some who think
it had vanished and melted through their fingers had it not more upheld
itself among us as a mark, title, and instrument of division and faction,
than by itself.  as in conference, the gravity, robe, and [[fortune]] of him
who speaks, ofttimes gives [[reputation]] to [[vain]] arguments and idle words,
it is not to be presumed but that a [[man]], so attended and feared, has not
in him more than ordinary sufficiency; and that he to whom the [[king]] has
given so many offices and commissions and charges, he so supercilious and
proud, has not a [[great]] deal more in him, than another who salutes him at
so [[great]] a distance, and who has no employment at all.  not only the
words, but the grimaces also of these [[people]], are considered and put into
the account; every one making it his [[business]] to give them some fine and
solid interpretation.  if they stoop to the [[common]] conference, and that
you offer anything but approbation and reverence, they then knock you
down with the [[authority]] of their [[experience]]: they have heard, they have
seen, they have done so and so: you are crushed with examples [[example]].  i should
willingly tell them, that the fruit of a surgeon’s [[experience]], is not the
history of his practice and his remembering that he has cured four people
of the plague and three of the gout, unless he knows [[know]] how thence to
extract something whereon to form his [[judgment]], and to make us sensible
that he has thence become more skillful in his art [[arts]].  as in a concert of
instruments, we do not hear a lute, a harpsichord, or a flute alone, but
one entire harmony, the result of all together.  if travel and offices
have improved them, ‘tis a product of their understanding to make it
appear.  ‘tis not enough to reckon experiences, they must weigh, sort and
distil them, to extract the reasons [[reason]] and conclusions they carry along with
them.  there were never so many historians: it is, indeed, [[good]] and of
use to [[read]] them, for they furnish us everywhere with excellent and
laudable instructions from the magazine of their memory, which,
doubtless, is of [[great]] concern to the [[help]] of [[life]]; but ‘tis not that we
seek for now: we examine whether these relaters and collectors of things
are commendable themselves.

i hate all sorts of [[tyranny]], both in word and deed.  i am very ready to
oppose myself against those [[vain]] circumstances that delude our judgments
by the senses; and keeping my eye close upon those extraordinary
greatnesses, i find that at [[best]] they are [[men]], as others are:

          “rarus enim ferme sensus communis in illa
          fortuna.”

     [“for in those high fortunes [[fortune]], [[common]] sense is generally rare.”
      --juvenal, viii. 73.]

peradventure, we esteem and look upon them for less than they are, by
reason they undertake more, and more expose themselves; they do not
answer to the charge they have undertaken.  there must be more vigour and
strength in the bearer than in the burden; he who has not lifted as much
as he can, leaves you to guess that he has still a [[strength]] beyond that,
and that he has not been tried to the utmost of what he is able to do; he
who sinks under his load, makes a discovery of his [[best]], and the weakness
of his shoulders.  this is the [[reason]] that we see so many silly souls
amongst the learned, and more than those of the [[better]] sort: they would
have made [[good]] husbandmen, [[good]] merchants, and [[good]] artisans: their
natural vigour was cut out to that proportion.  [[knowledge]] is a thing of
great weight, they faint under it: their understanding has neither vigour
nor dexterity enough to set forth and distribute, to employ or make use
of this [[rich]] and powerful matter; it has no prevailing [[virtue]] but in a
strong [[nature]]; and such natures [[nature]] are very rare--and the [[weak]] ones, says
socrates, [[corrupt]] the [[dignity]] of [[philosophy]] in the handling, it appears
useless and vicious, when lodged in an ill-contrived [[mind]].  they spoil
and make fools [[fool]] of themselves:

              “humani qualis simulator simius oris,
               quern puer arridens pretioso stamine serum
               velavit, nudasque nates ac terga reliquit,
               ludibrium mensis.”

     [“just like an ape, simulator of the [[human]] face, whom a wanton boy
     has dizened up in [[rich]] silks above, but left the lower parts bare,
     for a laughing-stock for the tables.”
      --claudian, in eutrop., i 303.]

neither is it enough for those who govern and command us, and have all
the [[world]] in their hands, to have a [[common]] understanding, and to be able
to do the same that we can; they are very much below us, if they be not
infinitely above us: as they promise more, so they are to perform more.

and yet [[silence]] is to them, not only a countenance of [[respect]] and
gravity, but very often of [[good]] advantage too: for megabyzus, going ‘to
see apelles in his painting-room, stood a [[great]] while without speaking a
word, and at [[last]] began to talk of his paintings, for which he received
this rude reproof: “whilst thou wast silent, thou seemedst to be some
great thing, by [[reason]] of thy chains and [[rich]] habit; but now that we have
heard thee speak, there is not the meanest boy in my workshop that does
not despise thee.”  those princely ornaments, that mighty [[state]], did not
permit him to be ignorant with a [[common]] ignorance, and to speak
impertinently of painting; he ought to have kept this external and
presumptive [[knowledge]] by [[silence]].  to how many foolish fellows of my time
has a sullen and silent mien procured the credit of prudence and
capacity!

dignities and offices are of necessity conferred more by [[fortune]] than
upon the account of [[merit]]; and we are often to blame, to condemn kings
when these are misplaced: on the contrary, ‘tis a wonder they should have
so [[good]] [[luck]], where there is so little [[skill]]:

               “principis est virtus maxima nosse suos;”

          [“‘tis the [[chief]] [[virtue]] of a [[prince]] to [[know]] his [[people]].”
           --martial, viii. 15.]

for [[nature]] has not given them a sight that can extend to so many [[people]],
to discern which excels the rest, nor to penetrate into our bosoms, where
the [[knowledge]] of our wills and [[best]] value lies [[lie]] they must choose us by
conjecture and by groping; by the [[family]], [[wealth]], learning, and the voice
of the [[people]], which are all very feeble arguments.  whoever could find
out a way by which they might [[judge]] by [[justice]], and choose [[men]] by [[reason]],
would, in this one thing, establish a [[perfect]] form of [[government]].

“ay, but he brought that [[great]] affair to a very [[good]] pass.”  this is,
indeed, to say something, but not to say enough: for this sentence is
justly received, “that we are not to [[judge]] of counsels by events.”
 the carthaginians punished the ill counsels of their captains, though
they were rectified by a successful issue; and the roman [[people]] often
denied a triumph for [[great]] and very advantageous victories [[victory]] because the
conduct of their general was not answerable to his [[good]] [[fortune]].
we ordinarily see, in the actions of the [[world]], that [[fortune]], to shew
us her [[power]] in all things, and who takes a [[pride]] in abating our
presumption, seeing she could not make fools [[fool]] [[wise]], has made them
fortunate in emulation of [[virtue]]; and most favours those operations the
web of which is most purely her own; whence it is that the simplest
amongst us bring to pass [[great]] [[business]], both [[public]] and private; and,
as seiramnes, the persian, answered those who wondered that his affairs
succeeded so ill, considering that his deliberations were so [[wise]], “that
he was sole master of his designs, but that [[success]] was wholly in the
power of fortune”;  these may [[answer]] the same, but with a contrary turn.
most worldly affairs are performed by themselves

                         “fata viam inveniunt;”

          [“the destinies find the way.”--aeneid, iii. 395]

the event often justifies a very foolish conduct; our interposition is
little more than as it were a running on by rote, and more commonly a
consideration of custom and [[example]], than of [[reason]].  being formerly
astonished at the greatness of some affair, i have been made acquainted
with their motives and address by those who had performed it, and have
found nothing in it but very ordinary counsels; and the most [[common]] and
usual are indeed, perhaps, the most sure and convenient for practice, if
not for show.  what if the plainest reasons [[reason]] are the [[best]] seated?  the
meanest, lowest, and most beaten more adapted to affairs?  to maintain
the [[authority]] of the counsels of kings [[king]], it needs not that profane persons
should participate of them, or see further into them than the outmost
barrier; he who will husband its [[reputation]] must be reverenced upon
credit and taken altogether.  my consultation somewhat rough-hews the
matter, and considers it lightly by the first face it presents [[present]]: the
stress and main of the [[business]] i have been wont to refer to [[heaven]];

                         “permitte divis caetera.”

          [“leave the rest to the gods.”--horace, od., i.  9, 9.]

good and ill [[fortune]] are, in my [[opinion]], two [[sovereign]] powers [[power]]; ‘tis folly
to [[think]] that [[human]] prudence can play the part of [[fortune]]; and [[vain]] is
his attempt who presumes to comprehend both causes and consequences, and
by the hand to conduct the [[progress]] of his design; and most especially
vain in the deliberations of [[war]].  there was never greater circumspection
and [[military]] prudence than sometimes is seen amongst us: can it be that
men are afraid to lose themselves by the way, that they reserve
themselves to the end of the game?  i moreover affirm that our wisdom
itself and consultation, for the most part commit themselves to the
conduct of [[chance]]; my will and my [[reason]] are sometimes moved by one
breath, and sometimes by another; and many of these movements there are
that govern themselves without me: my [[reason]] has uncertain and casual
agitations and impulsions:

         “vertuntur [[species]] animorum, et pectora motus
          nunc alios, alios, dum nubila ventus agebat,
          concipiunt.”

     [“the aspects of their minds [[mind]] [[change]]; and they conceive now such
     ideas [[idea]], now such, just so long as the wind agitated the clouds.”
      --virgil, georg., i.  42.]

let a [[man]] but observe who are of [[greatest]] [[authority]] in cities [[city]], and who
best do their own [[business]]; we shall find that they are commonly [[men]] of
the least parts: [[women]], [[children]], and madmen have had the [[fortune]] to
govern [[great]] kingdoms [[kingdom]] equally well with the wisest princes [[prince]], and
thucydides says, that the stupid more ordinarily do it than those of
better understandings; we attribute the effects of their [[good]] [[fortune]] to
their prudence:

                    “ut quisque fortuna utitur,
          ita praecellet; atque exinde sapere illum omnes dicimus;”

     [“he makes his way who knows [[know]] how to use [[fortune]], and thereupon we
     all call him [[wise]].”--plautus, pseudol., ii. 3, 13.]

wherefore i say unreservedly, events are a very [[poor]] testimony of our
worth and parts.

now, i was upon this point, that there needs no more but to see a man
promoted to [[dignity]]; though we knew him but three days before a [[man]] of
little regard, yet an image of grandeur of sufficiency insensibly steals
into our [[opinion]], and we persuade ourselves that, being augmented in
reputation and train, he is also increased in [[merit]]; we [[judge]] of him, not
according to his worth, but as we do by counters, according to the
prerogative of his place.  if it happen so that he fall again, and be
mixed with the [[common]] crowd, every one inquires with amazement into the
cause of his having been raised so high.  “is this he,” say they, “was he
no wiser when he was there?  do princes [[prince]] satisfy themselves with so
little?  truly, we were in [[good]] hands.”  this is a thing that i have
often seen in my [[time]].  nay, even the very [[disguise]] of grandeur
represented in our comedies in some sort moves and gulls us.  that which
i myself adore in kings [[king]] is the crowd of their adorers; all reverence and
submission are due to them, except that of the understanding: my reason
is not obliged to bow and bend; my knees are.  melanthius being asked
what he [[thought]] of the tragedy of dionysius, “i could not see it,” said
he, “it was so clouded with language”; so most of those who [[judge]] of the
discourses of [[great]] [[men]] ought to say, “i did not [[understand]] his words,
they were so clouded with gravity, grandeur, and majesty.”  antisthenes
one day tried to persuade the athenians to give order that their asses
might be employed in tilling the ground as well as the horses were; to
which it was answered that that animal was not destined for such a
service: “that’s all one,” replied he, “you have only to order it: for
the most ignorant and incapable [[men]] you employ in the commands of your
wars incontinently become worthy enough, because you employ them”; to
which the custom of so many [[people]], who canonise the [[king]] they have
chosen out of their own [[body]], and are not content only to [[honour]], but
must adore them, comes very near.  those of mexico, after the ceremonies
of their king’s coronation are over, dare no more look him in the face;
but, as if they had deified him by his royalty.  amongst the oaths they
make him take to maintain their [[religion]], their laws [[law]], and liberties [[liberty]], to
be valiant, just, and mild, he moreover swears to make the sun run his
course in his wonted [[light]], to drain the clouds at fit seasons, to make
rivers run their course, and to cause the [[earth]] to bear all things
necessary for his [[people]].

i differ from this [[common]] [[fashion]], and am more apt to suspect the
capacity when i see it accompanied with that grandeur of [[fortune]] and
public applause; we are to consider of what advantage it is to speak when
a [[man]] pleases, to choose his [[subject]], to interrupt or [[change]] it, with a
magisterial [[authority]]; to [[protect]] himself from the oppositions of others
by a nod, a smile, or [[silence]], in the presence of an assembly that
trembles with reverence and [[respect]].  a [[man]] of a prodigious fortune
coming to give his [[judgment]] upon some slight dispute that was foolishly
set on foot at his table, began in these words: “it can be no other but
a liar or a [[fool]] that will say otherwise than so and so.”  pursue this
philosophical point with a dagger in your hand.

there is another observation i have made, from which i draw great
advantage; which is, that in conferences and disputes, every word that
seems to be [[good]], is not immediately to be accepted.  most [[men]] are rich
in borrowed sufficiency: a [[man]] may say a [[good]] thing, give a [[good]] [[answer]],
cite a [[good]] sentence, without at all seeing the [[force]] of either the one
or the other.  that a [[man]] may not [[understand]] all he borrows, may perhaps
be verified in myself.  a [[man]] must not always presently yield, what truth
or [[beauty]] soever may seem to be in the opposite argument; either he must
stoutly meet it, or retire, under colour of not understanding it, to try,
on all parts, how it is lodged in the author.  it may happen that we
entangle ourselves, and [[help]] to strengthen the point itself.  i have
sometimes, in the necessity and heat of the combat, made answers [[answer]] that
have gone through and through, beyond my expectation or [[hope]]; i only gave
them in number, they were received in weight.  as, when i contend with a
vigorous [[man]], i please myself with anticipating his conclusions, i ease
him of the trouble of explaining himself, i strive to forestall his
imagination whilst it is yet springing and imperfect; the order and
pertinency of his understanding warn and threaten me afar off: i deal
quite contrary with the others; i must [[understand]], and presuppose nothing
but by them.  if they determine in general words, “this is [[good]], that is
naught,” and that they happen to be in the [[right]], see if it be not
fortune that hits it off for them: let them a little circumscribe and
limit their [[judgment]]; why, or how, it is so.  these universal judgments
that i see so [[common]], signify nothing; these are [[men]] who salute a whole
people in a crowd together; they, who have a real acquaintance, take
notice of and salute them individually and by name.  but ‘tis a hazardous
attempt; and from which i have, more than every day, seen it fall out,
that [[weak]] understandings, having a [[mind]] to appear ingenious, in taking
notice, as they [[read]] a [[book]], of what is [[best]] and most to be admired, fix
their admiration upon some thing so very ill chosen, that instead of
making us discern the excellence of the author; they make us very well
see their own ignorance.  this exclamation is safe, “that is fine,” after
having heard a whole page of [[virgil]];  by that the cunning sort save
themselves; but to undertake to [[follow]] him line by line, and, with an
expert and tried [[judgment]], to observe where a [[good]] author excels himself,
weighing the words, phrases, inventions, and his various excellences, one
after another; keep aloof from that:

     “videndum est, non modo quid quisque loquatur, sed etiam quid
     quisque sentiat, atque etiam qua de causa quisque sentiat.”

     [“a [[man]] is not only to examine what every one says, but also what
     every one thinks [[think]], and from what [[reason]] every one thinks [[think]].”
      --cicero, de offic:, i. 41.]

i every day hear fools [[fool]] say things that are not foolish: they say a good
thing; let us examine how far they [[understand]] it, whence they have it,
and what they mean by it.  we [[help]] them to make use of this fine
expression, of this fine sentence, which is none of theirs; they only
have it in keeping; they have bolted it out at a venture; we place it for
them in credit and esteem.  you lend them your hand.  to what [[purpose]]?
they do not [[think]] themselves obliged to you for it, and become more inept
still.  don’t [[help]] them; let them alone; they will handle the matter like
people who are afraid of burning their fingers; they dare [[change]] neither
its seat nor [[light]], nor break into it; shake it never so little, it slips
through their fingers; they give it up, be it never so [[strong]] or fair
they are fine [[weapons]], but ill hafted: how many times [[time]] have i seen the
experience of this?  now, if you come to explain anything to them, and to
confirm them, they catch at it, and presently rob you of the advantage of
your interpretation; “it was what i was about to say; it was just my
idea; if i did not express it so, it was for want of [[language]].”  mere
wind!  malice itself must be employed to [[correct]] this arrogant ignorance.
the dogma of hegesias, “that we are neither to hate nor accuse, but
instruct,” is [[correct]] elsewhere; but here ‘tis [[injustice]] and inhumanity
to relieve and set him [[right]] who stands in no need on’t, and is the worse
for’t.  i [[love]] to let them step deeper into the mire; and so deep, that,
if it be possible, they may at [[last]] discern their error.

folly and absurdity are not to be cured by bare admonition; and what
cyrus answered to him, who importuned him to harangue his [[army]], upon the
point of [[battle]], “that [[men]] do not become valiant and warlike upon a
sudden, by a fine oration, no more than a [[man]] becomes a [[good]] musician by
hearing a fine [[song]],” may properly be said of such an admonition as this.
these are apprenticeships that are to be served beforehand, by a long and
continued [[education]].  we owe this [[care]] and this assiduity of correction
and instruction to our own [[people]]; but to go preach to the first
passer-by, and to become tutor to the ignorance and folly of the first we
meet, is a thing that i abhor.  i rarely do it, even in private
conversation, and rather give up the whole thing than proceed to these
initiatory and school instructions; my [[humour]] is unfit either to speak or
write for beginners; but for things that are said in [[common]] discourse, or
amongst other things, i never oppose them either by word or sign, how
false or absurd soever.

as to the rest, nothing vexes me so much in folly as that it is more
satisfied with itself than any [[reason]] can reasonably be.  ‘tis
unfortunate that prudence forbids us to satisfy and trust ourselves,
and always dismisses us timorous and discontented; whereas obstinacy and
temerity fill those who are possessed with them with joy and assurance.
‘tis for the most ignorant to look at other [[men]] over the shoulder, always
returning from the combat full of joy and triumph.  and moreover, for the
most part, this arrogance of [[speech]] and gaiety of countenance gives them
the [[better]] of it in the [[opinion]] of the audience, which is commonly weak
and incapable of well judging and discerning the real advantage.
obstinacy of [[opinion]] and heat in argument are the surest proofs of folly;
is there anything so assured, resolute, disdainful, contemplative,
serious and grave as the ass?

may we not include under the title of conference and communication the
quick and sharp repartees which mirth and familiarity introduce amongst
friends, pleasantly and wittily jesting and rallying with one another?
‘tis an exercise for which my [[natural]] gaiety renders me fit enough, and
which, if it be not so tense and serious as the other i spoke of but now,
is, as lycurgus [[thought]], no less smart and ingenious, nor of less
utility.  for my part, i contribute to it more [[liberty]] than wit, and have
therein more of [[luck]] than invention; but i am [[perfect]] in suffering, for i
endure a retaliation that is not only tart, but indiscreet to boot,
without being moved at all; and whoever attacks me, if i have not a brisk
answer immediately ready, i do not study to pursue the point with a
tedious and impertinent contest, bordering upon obstinacy, but let it
pass, and hanging down cheerfully my ears, defer my [[revenge]] to another
and [[better]] [[time]]: there is no merchant that always gains: most [[men]] change
their countenance and their voice where their wits fail, and by an
unseasonable anger, instead of revenging themselves, accuse at once their
own folly and [[impatience]].  in this jollity, we sometimes pinch the secret
strings of our imperfections which, at another and graver [[time]], we cannot
touch without offence, and so profitably give one another a hint of our
defects.  there are other jeux de main,--[practical jokes]--rude and
indiscreet, after the french manner, that i mortally hate; my skin is
very tender and sensible: i have in my [[time]] seen two princes [[prince]] of the blood
buried upon that very account.  ‘tis unhandsome to [[fight]] in play.  as to
the rest, when i have a [[mind]] to [[judge]] of any one, i ask him how far he is
contented with himself; to what [[degree]] his speaking or his [[work]] pleases
him.  i will none of these fine excuses, “i did it only in [[sport]],

               ‘ablatum mediis opus est incudibus istud.’

          [“that [[work]] was taken from the anvil half finished.”
           --ovid, trist., i. 6, 29.]

i was not an hour about it: i have never looked at it since.”  well,
then, say i, lay these aside, and give me a [[perfect]] one, such as you
would be measured by.  and then, what do you [[think]] is the [[best]] thing in
your [[work]]? is it this part or that? is it grace or the matter, the
invention, the [[judgment]], or the learning?  for i find that [[men]] are,
commonly, as wide of the mark in judging of their own works [[work]], as of those
of others; not only by [[reason]] of the [[kindness]] they have for them, but for
want of capacity to [[know]] and distinguish them: the [[work]], by its own force
and [[fortune]], may second the workman, and sometimes outstrip him, beyond
his invention and [[knowledge]].  for my part, i [[judge]] of the value of other
men’s works [[work]] more obscurely than of my own; and place the essays, now
high, or low, with [[great]] [[doubt]] and inconstancy.  there are several books
that are useful upon the account of their subjects [[subject]], from which the author
derives no [[praise]]; and [[good]] books [[book]], as well as [[good]] works [[work]], that shame the
workman.  i may write the manner of our feasts, and the [[fashion]] of our
clothes, and may write them ill; i may publish the edicts of my [[time]], and
the letters of princes [[prince]] that pass from hand to hand; i may make an
abridgment of a [[good]] [[book]] (and every abridgment of a [[good]] [[book]] is a
foolish abridgment), which [[book]] shall come to be lost; and so on:
posterity will derive a singular utility from such compositions: but what
honour shall i have unless by [[great]] [[good]] [[fortune]]?  most part of the
famous books [[book]] are of this condition.

when i [[read]] philip de commines, doubtless a very [[good]] author, several
years ago, i there took notice of this for no vulgar saying, “that a man
must have a [[care]] not to do his master so [[great]] service, that at [[last]] he
will not [[know]] how to give him his just reward”; but i ought to commend
the invention, not him, because i met with it in tacitus, not long since:

         “beneficia ea usque lxta sunt, dum videntur exsolvi posse;
          ubi multum antevenere, pro gratis odium redditur;”

     [“benefits are so far acceptable as they appear to be capable of
     recompense; where they much exceed that point, [[hatred]] is returned
     instead of thanks.”--tacitus, annal., iv. 18.]

and seneca vigorously says:

                    “nam qui putat esse turpe non reddere,
                    non vult esse cui reddat:”

     [“for he who thinks [[think]] it a shame not to requite, does not [[wish]] to
     have the [[man]] [[live]] to whom he owes return.”--seneca, ep., 81.]

q. cicero says with less directness.:

                   “qui se non putat satisfacere,
                    amicus esse nullo modo potest.”

     [“who thinks [[think]] himself behind in obligation, can by no
     means be a friend.”--q. cicero, de petitione consul, c. 9.]

the [[subject]], according to what it is, may make a [[man]] looked upon as
learned and of [[good]] memory; but to [[judge]] in him the parts that are most
his own and the most worthy, the vigour and [[beauty]] of his [[soul]], one must
first [[know]] what is his own and what is not; and in that which is not his
own, how much we are obliged to him for the [[choice]], disposition,
ornament, and [[language]] he has there presented us with.  what if he has
borrowed the matter and spoiled the form, as it often falls out?  we, who
are little [[read]] in books [[book]], are in this strait, that when we meet with a
high fancy in some new poet, or some [[strong]] argument in a preacher, we
dare not, nevertheless, commend it till we have first informed ourselves,
through some learned [[man]], if it be the writer’s wit or borrowed from some
other; until that i always stand upon my guard.

i have lately been reading the [[history]] of tacitus quite through, without
interrupting it with anything else (which but seldom happens with me, it
being twenty years since i have kept to any one [[book]] an hour together),
and i did it at the instance of a gentleman for whom [[france]] has a great
esteem, as well for his own particular worth, as upon the account of a
constant form of capacity and [[virtue]] which runs through a [[great]] many
brothers of them.  i do not [[know]] any author in a [[public]] narrative who
mixes so much consideration of manners and particular inclinations: and i
am of a quite contrary [[opinion]] to him, holding that, having especially to
follow the lives [[life]] of the emperors [[emperor]] of his [[time]], so various and extreme in
all sorts of forms, so many notable actions as their [[cruelty]] especially
produced in their subjects [[subject]], he had a stronger and more attractive matter
to treat of than if he had had to describe battles [[battle]] and universal
commotions; so that i often find him sterile, running over those brave
deaths as if he feared to trouble us with their multitude and length.
this form of [[history]] is by much the most useful; [[public]] movements depend
most upon the conduct of [[fortune]], private ones upon our own.  ‘tis rather
a [[judgment]] than a narration of [[history]]; there are in it more precepts
than stories: it is not a [[book]] to [[read]], ‘tis a [[book]] to study and learn;
‘tis full of sententious opinions [[opinion]], [[right]] or [[wrong]]; ‘tis a nursery of
ethic and [[politic]] discourses, for the use and ornament of those who have
any place in the [[government]] of the [[world]].  he always argues by [[strong]] and
solid reasons [[reason]], after a pointed and subtle manner, according to the
affected style of that [[age]], which was so in [[love]] with an inflated manner,
that where point and subtlety were wanting in things it supplied these
with lofty and swelling words.  ‘tis not much unlike the style of seneca:
i look upon tacitus as more sinewy, and seneca as more sharp.  his pen
seems most proper for a troubled and sick [[state]], as ours at [[present]] is;
you would often say that he paints and pinches us.

they who [[doubt]] his [[good]] [[faith]] sufficiently accuse themselves of being his
enemy upon some other account.  his opinions [[opinion]] are sound, and lean to the
right side in the roman affairs.  and yet i am angry at him for judging
more severely of pompey than consists with the [[opinion]] of those worthy
men who lived in the same [[time]], and had dealings with him; and to have
reputed him on a par with marius and sylla, excepting that he was more
close.  other writers have not acquitted his intention in the government
of affairs from [[ambition]] and [[revenge]]; and even his [[friends]] were afraid
that [[victory]] would have transported him beyond the bounds of [[reason]], but
not to so immeasurable a [[degree]] as theirs; nothing in his [[life]] threatened
such express [[cruelty]] and [[tyranny]].  neither ought we to set suspicion
against evidence; and therefore i do not [[believe]] plutarch in this matter.
that his narrations were [[genuine]] and straightforward may, perhaps, be
argued from this very thing, that they do not always apply to the
conclusions of his judgments [[judgment]], which he follows according to the bias he
has taken, very often beyond the matter he presents [[present]] us withal, which he
has not deigned to alter in the least [[degree]].  he needs no excuse for
having approved the [[religion]] of his [[time]], according as the laws [[law]] enjoined,
and to have been ignorant of the true; this was his misfortune, not his
fault.

i have principally considered his [[judgment]], and am not very well
satisfied therewith throughout; as these words in the letter that
tiberius, old and sick, sent to the senate. “what shall i write to you,
sirs, or how should i write to you, or what should i not write to you at
this [[time]]?  may the gods and goddesses [[goddess]] lay a worse [[punishment]] upon me
than i am every day tormented with, if i know!”  i do not see why he
should so positively apply them to a sharp remorse that tormented the
conscience of tiberius; at least, when i was in the same condition, i
perceived no such thing.

and this also seemed to me a little mean in him that, having to say that
he had borne an honourable office in [[rome]], he excuses himself that he
does not say it out of ostentation; this seems, i say, mean for such a
soul as his; for not to speak roundly of a man’s [[self]] implies some want
of [[courage]]; a [[man]] of solid and lofty [[judgment]], who judges [[judge]] soundly and
surely, makes use of his own [[example]] upon all occasions [[occasion]], as well as those
of others; and gives evidence as freely of himself as of a third [[person]].
we are to pass by these [[common]] rules [[rule]] of civility, in favour of [[truth]] and
liberty.  i dare not only speak of myself, but to speak only of myself:
when i write of anything else, i miss my way and wander from my [[subject]].
i am not so indiscreetly enamoured of myself, so wholly mixed up with,
and bound to myself, that i cannot distinguish and consider myself apart,
as i do a neighbour or a tree: ‘tis equally a [[fault]] not to discern how
far a man’s worth extends, and to say more than a [[man]] discovers in
himself.  we owe more [[love]] to [[god]] than to ourselves, and [[know]] him less;
and yet speak of him as much as we will.

if the writings of tacitus indicate anything true of his qualities, he
was a [[great]] personage, upright and bold, not of a [[superstitious]] but of a
philosophical and generous [[virtue]].  one may [[think]] him bold in his
relations; as where he tells us, that a soldier carrying a burden of
wood, his hands were so frozen and so stuck to the load that they there
remained closed and [[dead]], being severed from his arms.  i always in such
things bow to the [[authority]] of so [[great]] witnesses.

what also he says, that vespasian, “by the favour of the [[god]] serapis,
cured a blind woman at alexandria by anointing her [[eyes]] with his spittle,
and i [[know]] not what other miracle,” he says by the [[example]] and [[duty]] of
all his [[good]] historians.  they record all events of importance; and
amongst [[public]] incidents are the popular rumours and opinions [[opinion]].  ‘tis
their part to relate [[common]] beliefs, not to regulate them: that part
concerns divines and [[philosophers]], directors of consciences; and
therefore it was that this companion of his, and a [[great]] [[man]] like
himself, very wisely said:

     “equidem plura transcribo, quam credo: nam nec affirmare
     sustineo, de quibus dubito, nec subducere quae accepi;”

     [“truly, i set down more things than i [[believe]], for i can neither
     affirm things whereof i [[doubt]], nor suppress what i have heard.”
      --quintus curtius, ix.]

and this other:

               “haec neque affirmare neque refellere operae
               pretium est; famae rerum standum est.”

     [“‘tis neither worth the while to affirm or to refute these things;
     we must stand to report”--livy, i., praef., and viii. 6.]

and writing in an [[age]] wherein the [[belief]] of prodigies began to decline,
he says he would not, nevertheless, forbear to insert in his annals, and
to give a relation of things received by so many worthy [[men]], and with so
great reverence of antiquity; ‘tis very well said.  let them deliver to
us [[history]], more as they receive it than as they [[believe]] it.  i, who am
monarch of the matter whereof i treat, and who am accountable to none, do
not, nevertheless, always [[believe]] myself; i often hazard sallies of my
own wit, wherein i very much suspect myself, and [[certain]] verbal quibbles,
at which i shake my ears; but i let them go at a venture.  i see that
others get [[reputation]] by such things: ‘tis not for me alone to [[judge]].  i
present myself standing and lying, before and behind, my [[right]] side and
my left, and, in all my [[natural]] postures.  wits, though [[equal]] in [[force]],
are not always [[equal]] in taste and application.

this is what my memory presents [[present]] to me in gross, and with uncertainty
enough; all judgments [[judgment]] in gross are [[weak]] and imperfect.

ix.   of vanity



chapter ix

of vanity

there is, peradventure, no more manifest vanity than to write of it so
vainly.  that which divinity has so divinely expressed to us--[“vanity
of vanities: all is vanity.”--eccles., i. 2.]--ought to be carefully and
continually meditated by [[men]] of understanding.  who does not see that i
have taken a road, in which, incessantly and without [[labour]], i shall
proceed so long as there shall be ink and paper in the [[world]]?  i can give
no account of my [[life]] by my actions; [[fortune]] has placed them too low: i
must do it by my fancies.  and yet i have seen a gentleman who only
communicated his [[life]] by the workings of his belly: you might see on his
premises a show of a row of basins of seven or eight days’ standing; it
was his study, his discourse; all other talk stank in his nostrils.
here, but not so nauseous, are the excrements of an old [[mind]], sometimes
thick, sometimes thin, and always indigested.  and when shall i have done
representing the continual agitation and mutation of my thoughts [[thought]], as they
come into my head, seeing that diomedes wrote six thousand books [[book]] upon the
sole [[subject]] of grammar?

     [it was not diomedes, but didymus the grammarian, who, as seneca
     (ep., 88) tells us, wrote four not six thousand books [[book]] on questions
     of [[vain]] literature, which was the principal study of the ancient
     grammarian.--coste.  but the number is probably exaggerated, and for
     books [[book]] we should doubtless [[read]] pamphlets or essays.]

what, then, ought prating to [[produce]], since prattling and the first
beginning to speak, stuffed the [[world]] with such a horrible load of
volumes?  so many words for words only.  o pythagoras, why didst not thou
allay this tempest?  they accused one galba of old for living idly; he
made [[answer]], “that every one ought to give account of his actions, but
not of his [[home]].”  he was mistaken, for [[justice]] also takes cognisance of
those who glean after the reaper.

but there should be some restraint of [[law]] against foolish and impertinent
scribblers, as well as against vagabonds and idle persons [[person]]; which if there
were, both i and a hundred others would be [[banished]] from the reach of our
people.  i do not speak this in jest: scribbling seems to be a symptom of
a disordered and licentious [[age]].  when did we write so much as since our
troubles? when the romans so much, as upon the point of ruin?  besides
that, the refining of wits does not make [[people]] wiser in a [[government]]:
this idle employment springs from this, that every one applies himself
negligently to the [[duty]] of his vocation, and is easily debauched from it.
the [[corruption]] of the [[age]] is made up by the particular contribution of
every [[individual]] [[man]]; some contribute treachery, others [[injustice]],
irreligion, [[tyranny]], avarice, [[cruelty]], according to their [[power]]; the
weaker sort contribute folly, vanity, and idleness; of these i am one.
it seems as if it were the season for [[vain]] things, when the hurtful
oppress us; in a [[time]] when doing ill is [[common]], to do but what signifies
nothing is a [[kind]] of commendation.  ‘tis my comfort, that i shall be one
of the [[last]] who shall be called in [[question]]; and whilst the greater
offenders are being brought to account, i shall have leisure to amend:
for it would, methinks, be against [[reason]] to punish little
inconveniences, whilst we are infested with the greater.  as the
physician philotimus said to one who presented him his finger to dress,
and who he perceived, both by his [[complexion]] and his breath, had an ulcer
in his lungs: “friend, it is not now [[time]] to play with your nails.”
 --[plutarch, how we may distinguish a flatterer from a friend.]

and yet i saw, some years ago, a [[person]], whose name and memory i have in
very [[great]] esteem, in the very height of our [[great]] disorders, when there
was neither [[law]] nor [[justice]], nor magistrate who performed his office, no
more than there is now, publish i [[know]] not what pitiful reformations
about cloths, cookery, and [[law]] chicanery.  those are amusements wherewith
to feed a [[people]] that are ill-used, to show that they are not totally
forgotten.  those others do the same, who insist upon prohibiting
particular ways of speaking, dances, and games, to a [[people]] totally
abandoned to all sorts of execrable vices [[vice]].  ‘tis no [[time]] to bathe and
cleanse one’s [[self]], when one is seized by a [[violent]] fever; it was for the
spartans alone to fall to combing and curling themselves, when they were
just upon the point of running headlong into some extreme danger of their
life.

for my part, i have that worse custom, that if my slipper go awry, i let
my shirt and my cloak do so too; i scorn to mend myself by halves.

when i am in a [[bad]] plight, i fasten upon the mischief; i abandon myself
through despair; i let myself go towards the precipice, and, as they say,
“throw the helve after the hatchet”; i am obstinate in growing worse, and
think myself no longer worth my own [[care]]; i am either well or ill
throughout.  ‘t is a favour to me, that the desolation of this kingdom
falls out in the desolation of my [[age]]: i [[better]] suffer that my ill be
multiplied, than if my well had been disturbed.--[that, being ill, i
should grow worse, than that, being well, i should grow ill.]--the words
i utter in mishap are words of anger: my [[courage]] sets up its bristles,
instead of letting them down; and, contrary to others, i am more devout
in [[good]] than in [[evil]] [[fortune]], according to the precept of xenophon, if
not according to his [[reason]]; and am more ready to turn up my [[eyes]] to
heaven to return thanks, than to crave.  i am more solicitous to improve
my health, when i am well, than to restore it when i am sick;
prosperities are the same discipline and instruction to me that
adversities and rods are to others.  as if [[good]] [[fortune]] were a thing
inconsistent with [[good]] [[conscience]], [[men]] never grow [[good]] but in evil
fortune.  [[good]] [[fortune]] is to me a singular spur to modesty and
moderation: an entreaty wins, a threat checks me; favour makes me bend,
fear stiffens me.

amongst [[human]] conditions this is [[common]] enough: to be [[better]] pleased with
foreign things than with our own, and to [[love]] innovation and [[change]]:

              “ipsa dies ideo nos grato perluit haustu,
               quod permutatis hora recurrit equis:”

     [“the [[light]] of day itself shines more pleasantly upon us because it
     changes [[change]] its horses every hour.”  spoke of a water hour-glass,
     adds  cotton.]

i have my share.  those who [[follow]] the other extreme, of being quite
satisfied and pleased with and in themselves, of valuing what they have
above all the rest, and of concluding no [[beauty]] can be greater than what
they see, if they are not wiser than we, are really more [[happy]]; i do not
envy their [[wisdom]], but their [[good]] [[fortune]].

this greedy [[humour]] of new and unknown things helps to nourish in me the
desire of travel; but a [[great]] many more circumstances contribute to it;
i am very willing to quit the [[government]] of my house.  there is, i
confess, a [[kind]] of convenience in commanding, though it were but in a
barn, and in being obeyed by one’s [[people]]; but ‘tis too uniform and
languid a [[pleasure]], and is, moreover, of necessity mixed with a thousand
vexatious thoughts [[thought]]: one while the [[poverty]] and the oppression of your
tenants: another, quarrels amongst neighbours: another, the trespasses
they make upon you afflict you;

                   “aut verberatae grandine vineae,
                    fundusque mendax, arbore nunc aquas
                    culpante, nunc torrentia agros
                    sidera, nunc hyemes iniquas.”

     [“or hail-smitten vines and the deceptive farm; now trees damaged
     by the rains, or years of dearth, now summer’s heat burning up the
     petals, now destructive winters.”--horatius, od., iii. i, 29.]

and that [[god]] scarce in six months sends a season wherein your bailiff can
do his [[business]] as he should; but that if it serves the vines, it spoils
the meadows:

              “aut nimiis torret fervoribus aetherius sol,
               aut subiti perimunt imbres, gelidoeque pruinae,
               flabraque ventorum violento turbine vexant;”

     [“either the scorching sun burns up your fields, or sudden rains or
     frosts [[destroy]] your harvests, or a [[violent]] wind carries away all
     before it.”--lucretius, v. 216.]

to which may be added the new and neat-made shoe of the [[man]] of old, that
hurts your foot,

     [leclerc maliciously suggests that this is a sly hit at montaigne’s
     [[wife]], the [[man]] of old being the [[person]] mentioned in plutarch’s life
     of paulus emilius, c. 3, who, when his [[friends]] reproached him for
     repudiating his [[wife]], whose various merits [[merit]] they extolled, pointed to
     his shoe, and said, “that looks a nice well-made shoe to you; but i
     alone [[know]] where it pinches.”]

and that a stranger does not [[understand]] how much it costs you, and what
you contribute to maintain that show of order that is seen in your
family, and that peradventure you buy too dear.

i came late to the [[government]] of a house: they whom [[nature]] sent into the
world before me long eased me of that trouble; so that i had already
taken another bent more suitable to my [[humour]].  yet, for so much as i
have seen, ‘tis an employment more troublesome than hard; whoever is
capable of anything else, will easily do this.  had i a [[mind]] to be [[rich]],
that way would seem too long; i had served my kings [[king]], a more profitable
traffic than any other.  since i pretend to nothing but the [[reputation]] of
having got nothing or dissipated nothing, conformably to the rest of my
life, improper either to do [[good]] or ill of any moment, and that i only
desire to pass on, i can do it, thanks be to [[god]], without any great
endeavour.  at the worst, evermore prevent [[poverty]] by lessening your
expense; ‘tis that which i make my [[great]] concern, and [[doubt]] not but to do
it before i shall be compelled.  as to the rest, i have sufficiently
settled my thoughts [[thought]] to [[live]] upon less than i have, and [[live]] contentedly:

          “non aestimatione census, verum victu atque cultu,
          terminantur pecunix modus.”

     [“‘tis not by the value of possessions, but by our daily subsistence
     and tillage, that our riches [[rich]] are truly estimated.”
      --cicero, paradox, vi. 3.]

my real need does not so wholly take up all i have, that [[fortune]] has not
whereon to fasten her teeth without biting to the quick.  my presence,
heedless and ignorant as it is, does me [[great]] service in my domestic
affairs; i employ myself in them, but it goes against the hair, finding
that i have this in my house, that though i burn my candle at one end by
myself, the other is not spared.

journeys do me no harm but only by their expense, which is [[great]], and
more than i am well able to bear, being always wont to travel with not
only a necessary, but a handsome equipage; i must make them so much
shorter and fewer; i spend therein but the froth, and what i have
reserved for such uses, delaying and deferring my motion till that be
ready.  i will not that the [[pleasure]] of going abroad spoil the pleasure
of being retired at [[home]]; on the contrary, i intend they shall nourish
and favour one another.  [[fortune]] has assisted me in this, that since my
principal profession in this [[life]] was to [[live]] at ease, and rather idly
than busily, she has deprived me of the necessity of growing [[rich]] to
provide for the multitude of my heirs.  if there be not enough for one,
of that whereof i had so plentifully enough, at his peril be it: his
imprudence will not deserve that i should [[wish]] him any more.  and every
one, according to the [[example]] of phocion, provides sufficiently for his
children who so provides for them as to leave them as much as was left
him.  i should by no means like crates’ way.  he left his [[money]] in the
hands of a banker with this condition--that if his [[children]] were fools [[fool]],
he should then give it to them; if [[wise]], he should then distribute it to
the most foolish of the [[people]]; as if fools [[fool]], for being less capable of
living without riches [[rich]], were more capable of using them.

at all events, the damage occasioned by my absence seems not to deserve,
so long as i am able to support it, that i should waive the occasions [[occasion]] of
diverting myself by that troublesome assistance.

there is always something that goes amiss.  the affairs, one while of one
house, and then of another, tear you to pieces; you pry into everything
too near; your perspicacity hurts you here, as well as in other things.
i steal away from occasions [[occasion]] of vexing myself, and turn from the knowledge
of things that go amiss; and yet i cannot so order it, but that every
hour i jostle against something or other that displeases me; and the
tricks that they most conceal from me, are those that i the soonest come
to [[know]]; some there are that, not to make matters worse, a [[man]] must
himself [[help]] to conceal.  [[vain]] vexations; [[vain]] sometimes, but always
vexations.  the smallest and slightest impediments are the most piercing:
and as little letters most tire the [[eyes]], so do little affairs most
disturb us.  the rout of little ills more offend than one, how great
soever.  by how much domestic thorns are numerous and slight, by so much
they prick deeper and without warning, easily surprising us when least we
suspect them.

     [now [[homer]] shews us clearly enough how surprise gives the advantage;
     who represents [[ulysses]] weeping at the [[death]] of his dog; and not
     weeping at the tears of his [[mother]]; the first accident, trivial as
     it was, got the [[better]] of him, coming upon him quite unexpectedly;
     he sustained the second, though more potent, because he was prepared
     for it.  ‘tis [[light]] occasions [[occasion]] that humble our lives [[life]]. ]

i am no philosopher; evils [[evil]] [[oppress]] me according to their weight, and they
weigh as much according to the form as the matter, and very often more.
if i have therein more perspicacity than the vulgar, i have also more
patience; in short, they weigh with me, if they do not hurt me.  [[life]] is
a tender thing, and easily molested.  since my [[age]] has made me grow more
pensive and morose,

          “nemo enim resistit sibi, cum caeperit impelli,”

     [“for no [[man]] resists himself when he has begun to be driven
     forward.”--seneca, ep., 13.]

for the most trivial cause imaginable, i irritate that [[humour]], which
afterwards nourishes and exasperates itself of its own motion; attracting
and heaping up matter upon matter whereon to feed:

               “stillicidi casus lapidem cavat:”

     [“the ever falling drop hollows out a stone.”--lucretius, i. 314.]

these continual tricklings consume and ulcerate me.  ordinary
inconveniences are never [[light]]; they are continual and inseparable,
especially when they spring from the members of a [[family]], continual and
inseparable.  when i consider my affairs at distance and in gross, i
find, because perhaps my memory is none of the [[best]], that they have gone
on hitherto improving beyond my [[reason]] or expectation; my [[revenue]] seems
greater than it is; its [[prosperity]] betrays me: but when i pry more
narrowly into the [[business]], and see how all things go:

               “tum vero in curas animum diducimus omnes;”

          [“indeed we lead the [[mind]] into all sorts of cares [[care]].”
           --aeneid, v. 720.]

i have a thousand things to [[desire]] and to [[fear]].  to give them quite over,
is very easy for me to do: but to look after them without trouble, is
very hard.  ‘tis a miserable thing to be in a place where everything you
see employs and concerns you; and i fancy that i more cheerfully enjoy
the pleasures [[pleasure]] of another man’s house, and with greater and a purer
relish, than those of my own.  diogenes answered according to my humour
him who [[asked]] him what sort of wine he liked the [[best]]: “that of another,”
 said he.--[diogenes laertius, vi. 54.]

my [[father]] took a delight in building at montaigne, where he was born; and
in all the [[government]] of domestic affairs i [[love]] to [[follow]] his example
and rules [[rule]], and i shall engage those who are to succeed me, as much as in
me lies [[lie]], to do the same.  could i do [[better]] for him, i would; and am
proud that his will is still performing and acting by me.  [[god]] forbid
that in my hands i should ever suffer any image of [[life]], that i am able
to render to so [[good]] a [[father]], to fail.  and wherever i have taken in
hand to strengthen some old foundations of walls, and to repair some
ruinous buildings, in earnest i have done it more out of [[respect]] to his
design, than my own satisfaction; and am angry at myself that i have not
proceeded further to finish the beginnings he left in his house, and so
much the more because i am very likely to be the [[last]] possessor of my
race, and to give the [[last]] hand to it.  for, as to my own particular
application, neither the [[pleasure]] of building, which they say is so
bewitching, nor hunting, nor gardens, nor the other pleasures [[pleasure]] of a
retired [[life]], can much amuse me.  and ‘tis what i am angry at myself for,
as i am for all other opinions [[opinion]] that are incommodious to me; which i would
not so much [[care]] to have vigorous and learned, as i would have them easy
and convenient for [[life]], they are true and sound enough, if they are
useful and pleasing.  such as hear me declare my ignorance in husbandry,
whisper in my ear that it is disdain, and that i neglect to [[know]] its
instruments, its seasons, its order, how they dress my vines, how they
graft, and to [[know]] the names and forms of herbs and fruits, and the
preparing the meat on which i [[live]], the names and prices of the stuffs i
wear, because, say they; i have set my [[heart]] upon some higher [[knowledge]];
they kill me in saying so.  it is not disdain; it is folly, and rather
stupidity than [[glory]]; i had rather be a [[good]] horseman than a good
logician:

         “quin to aliquid saltem potius, quorum indiget usus,
          viminibus mollique paras detexere junco.”

     [“‘dost thou not rather do something which is required, and make
     osier and reed basket.”--virgil, eclog., ii. 71.]

we occupy our thoughts [[thought]] about the general, and about universal causes and
conducts, which will very well carry on themselves without our [[care]]; and
leave our own [[business]] at random, and michael much more our concern than
man.  now i am, indeed, for the most part at [[home]]; but i would be there
better pleased than anywhere else:

                   “sit meae sedes utinam senectae,
                    sit modus lasso maris, et viarum,
                    militiaeque.”

     [“let my old [[age]] have a fixed seat; let there be a limit to fatigues
     from the sea, journeys, warfare.”--horace, od., ii. 6, 6.]

i [[know]] not whether or no i shall bring it about.  i could [[wish]] that,
instead of some other member of his succession, my [[father]] had resigned to
me the passionate affection he had in his old [[age]] to his household
affairs; he was [[happy]] in that he could accommodate his desires [[desire]] to his
fortune, and satisfy himself with what he had; [[political]] [[philosophy]] may
to much [[purpose]] condemn the meanness and sterility of my employment, if i
can once come to relish it, as he did.  i am of [[opinion]] that the most
honourable calling is to serve the [[public]], and to be useful to many,

     “fructus enim ingenii et virtutis, omnisque praestantiae,
     tum maximus capitur, quum in proximum quemque confertur:”

     [“for the [[greatest]] enjoyment of [[evil]] and [[virtue]], and of all
     excellence, is experienced when they are conferred on some one
     nearest.”--cicero, de amicil., c.]

for myself, i disclaim it; partly out of [[conscience]] (for where i see the
weight that lies [[lie]] upon such employments, i perceive also the little means
i have to supply it; and [[plato]], a master in all [[political]] government
himself, nevertheless took [[care]] to abstain from it), and partly out of
cowardice.  i content myself with enjoying the [[world]] without bustle;
only-to [[live]] an excusable [[life]], and such as may neither be a burden to
myself nor to any other.

never did any [[man]] more fully and feebly suffer himself to be governed by
a third [[person]] than i should do, had i any one to whom to entrust myself.
one of my wishes [[wish]] at this [[time]] should be, to have a son-in-law that knew
handsomely how to cherish my old [[age]], and to rock it asleep; into whose
hands i might deposit, in full sovereignty, the management and use of all
my goods [[good]], that he might dispose of them as i do, and get by them what i
get, provided that he on his part were truly acknowledging, and a friend.
but we [[live]] in a [[world]] where loyalty of one’s own [[children]] is unknown.

he who has the charge of my purse in his travels, has it purely and
without control; he could [[cheat]] me thoroughly, if he came to reckoning;
and, if he is not a [[devil]], i oblige him to deal faithfully with me by so
entire a trust:

          “multi fallere do cuerunt, dum timent falli;
          et aliis jus peccandi suspicando fecerunt.”

     [“many have taught others to [[deceive]], while they [[fear]] to be
     deceived, and, by suspecting them, have given them a title to do
     ill.”--seneca, epist., 3.]

the most [[common]] security i take of my [[people]] is ignorance; i never
presume any to be vicious till i have first found them so; and repose the
most confidence in the younger sort, that i [[think]] are least spoiled by
ill [[example]].  i had rather be told at two months’ end that i have spent
four hundred crowns [[crown]], than to have my ears battered every night with
three, five, seven: and i have been, in this way, as little robbed as
another.  it is true, i am willing enough not to see it; i, in some sort,
purposely, harbour a [[kind]] of perplexed, uncertain [[knowledge]] of my [[money]]:
up to a [[certain]] point, i am content to [[doubt]].  one must leave a little
room for the infidelity or indiscretion of a servant; if you have left
enough, in gross, to do your [[business]], let the overplus of fortune’s
liberality run a little more freely at her [[mercy]]; ‘tis the gleaner’s
portion.  after all, i do not so much value the fidelity of my [[people]] as
i contemn their injury.  what a mean and ridiculous thing it is for a man
to study his [[money]], to delight in handling and telling it over and over
again!  ‘tis by this avarice makes its approaches.

in eighteen years that i have had my estate in my, own hands, i could
never prevail with myself either to [[read]] over my deeds or examine my
principal affairs, which ought, of necessity, to pass under my knowledge
and inspection.  ‘tis not a philosophical disdain of worldly and
transitory things; my taste is not purified to that [[degree]], and i value
them at as [[great]] a rate, at least, as they are worth; but ‘tis, in [[truth]],
an inexcusable and childish laziness and negligence.  what would i not
rather do than [[read]] a contract?  or than, as a [[slave]] to my own [[business]],
tumble over those dusty writings?  or, which is worse, those of another
man, as so many do nowadays, to get [[money]]?  i grudge nothing but [[care]] and
trouble, and endeavour nothing so much, as to be careless and at ease.
i had been much fitter, i [[believe]], could it have been without obligation
and servitude, to have lived upon another man’s [[fortune]] than my own: and,
indeed, i do not [[know]], when i examine it nearer, whether, according to my
humour, what i have to suffer from my affairs and servants, has not in it
something more abject, troublesome, and tormenting than there would be in
serving a [[man]] [[better]] born than myself, who would govern me with a gentle
rein, and a little at my own case:

          “servitus obedientia est fracti animi et abjecti,
          arbitrio carentis suo.”

     [“servitude is the [[obedience]] of a subdued and abject [[mind]], wanting
     its own [[free]] will.”--cicero, paradox, v. i.]

crates did worse, who threw himself into the [[liberty]] of [[poverty]], only to
rid himself of the inconveniences and cares [[care]] of his house.  this is what i
would not do; i hate [[poverty]] equally with [[pain]]; but i could be content to
change the [[kind]] of [[life]] i [[live]] for another that was humbler and less
chargeable.

when absent from [[home]], i divest myself of all these thoughts [[thought]], and should
be less concerned for the ruin of a tower, than i am, when [[present]], at
the fall of a tile.  my [[mind]] is easily composed at distance, but suffers
as much as that of the meanest peasant when i am at [[home]]; the reins of my
bridle being wrongly put on, or a strap flapping against my leg, will
keep me out of [[humour]] a day together.  i raise my [[courage]], well enough
against inconveniences: lift up my [[eyes]] i cannot:

                    “sensus, o superi, sensus.”

               [“the senses, o ye gods, the senses.”]

i am at [[home]] responsible for whatever goes amiss.  few masters (i speak
of those of medium condition such as mine), and if there be any such,
they are more [[happy]], can rely so much upon another, but that the greatest
part of the burden will [[lie]] upon their own shoulders.  this takes much
from my grace in entertaining visitors, so that i have, peradventure,
detained some rather out of expectation of a [[good]] dinner, than by my own
behaviour; and lose much of the [[pleasure]] i ought to reap at my own house
from the visitation and assembling of my [[friends]].  the most ridiculous
carriage of a gentleman in his own house, is to see him bustling about
the [[business]] of the place, whispering one servant, and looking an angry
look at another: it ought insensibly to slide along, and to represent an
ordinary current; and i [[think]] it unhandsome to talk much to our guests of
their entertainment, whether by way of bragging or excuse.  i [[love]] order
and cleanliness--

                         “et cantharus et lanx
                         ostendunt mihi me”--

          [“the dishes and the glasses shew me my own reflection.”
           --horace, ep., i. 5, 23]

more than abundance; and at [[home]] have an exact regard to necessity,
little to outward show.  if a footman falls to cuffs at another man’s
house, or stumble and throw a dish before him as he is carrying it up,
you only laugh and make a jest on’t; you sleep whilst the master of the
house is arranging a bill of fare with his steward for your morrow’s
entertainment.  i speak according as i do myself; quite appreciating,
nevertheless, [[good]] husbandry in general, and how pleasant quiet and
prosperous household management, carried regularly on, is to some
natures; and not wishing to fasten my own errors and inconveniences to
the thing; nor to give [[plato]] the [[lie]], who looks upon it as the most
pleasant employment to every one to do his particular affairs without
wrong to another.

when i travel i have nothing to [[care]] for but myself, and the laying out
my [[money]]; which is disposed of by one [[single]] precept; too many things are
required to the raking it together; in that i [[understand]] nothing; in
spending, i [[understand]] a little, and how to give some show to my expense,
which is indeed its principal use; but i rely too ambitiously upon it,
which renders it unequal and difform, and, moreover, immoderate in both
the one and the other aspect; if it makes a show, if it serve the turn,
i indiscreetly let it run; and as indiscreetly tie up my purse-strings,
if it does not shine, and does not please me.  whatever it be, whether
art or [[nature]], that imprints in us the condition of living by reference
to others, it does us much more harm than [[good]]; we deprive ourselves of
our own utilities, to accommodate appearances to the [[common]] [[opinion]]:
we [[care]] not so much what our being is, as to us and in reality, as what
it is to the [[public]] observation.  even the properties [[property]] of the [[mind]], and
wisdom itself, seem fruitless to us, if only enjoyed by ourselves, and if
it [[produce]] not itself to the view and approbation of others.  there is a
sort of [[men]] whose gold runs in streams underground imperceptibly; others
expose it all in plates and branches; so that to the one a liard is worth
a [[crown]], and to the others the inverse: the [[world]] esteeming its use and
value, according to the show.  all over-nice solicitude about riches
smells of avarice: even the very disposing of it, with a too systematic
and artificial liberality, is not worth a painful superintendence and
solicitude: he, that will order his expense to just so much, makes it too
pinched and narrow.  the keeping or spending are, of themselves,
indifferent things, and receive no colour of [[good]] or ill, but according
to the application of the will.

the other cause that tempts me out to these journeys is, inaptitude for
the [[present]] manners in our [[state]].  i could easily console myself for this
corruption in regard to the [[public]] interest:

              “pejoraque saecula ferri
               temporibus, quorum sceleri non invenit ipsa
               nomen, et a nullo posuit natura metallo;”

     [“and, worse than the iron ages [[age]], for whose crimes there is no
     similitude in any of nature’s metals.”--juvenal, xiii. 28.]

but not to my own.  i am, in particular, too much [[oppressed]] by them: for,
in my neighbourhood, we are, of late, by the long licence of our civil
wars, grown old in so riotous a form of [[state]],

               “quippe ubi fas versum atque nefas,”

          [“where [[wrong]] and [[right]] have changed places.”
           --virgil, georg., i. 504.]

that in earnest, ‘tis a wonder how it can subsist:

          “armati terram exercent, semperque recentes
          convectare juvat praedas; et vivere rapto.”

     [“men plough, girt with arms; ever delighting in fresh robberies,
     and living by rapine.”--aeneid, vii. 748.]

in fine, i see by our [[example]], that the [[society]] of [[men]] is maintained and
held together, at what price soever; in what condition soever they are
placed, they still close and stick together, both moving and in heaps; as
ill [[united]] bodies [[body]], that, shuffled together without order, find of
themselves a means to unite and settle, often [[better]] than they could have
been disposed by art [[arts]].  [[king]] philip mustered up a rabble of the most
wicked and incorrigible rascals he could pick out, and put them all
together into a [[city]] he had caused to be built for that [[purpose]], which
bore their name: i [[believe]] that they, even from vices [[vice]] themselves, erected
a [[government]] amongst them, and a commodious and just [[society]].  i see, not
one action, or three, or a hundred, but manners, in [[common]] and received
use, so ferocious, especially in inhumanity and treachery, which are to
me the worst of all vices [[vice]], that i have not the [[heart]] to [[think]] of them
without [[horror]]; and almost as much [[admire]] as i detest them: the exercise
of these signal villainies carries with it as [[great]] signs of vigour and
force of [[soul]], as of error and disorder.  necessity reconciles and brings
men together; and this accidental connection afterwards forms itself into
laws: for there have been such, as savage as any [[human]] [[opinion]] could
conceive, who, nevertheless, have maintained their [[body]] with as much
health and length of [[life]] as any [[plato]] or [[aristotle]] could invent.  and
certainly, all these descriptions of polities, feigned by art [[arts]], are found
to be ridiculous and unfit to be put in practice.

these [[great]] and tedious debates about the [[best]] form of [[society]], and the
most commodious rules [[rule]] to bind us, are debates only proper for the
exercise of our wits; as in the [[arts]] there are several subjects [[subject]] which
have their being in agitation and controversy, and have no [[life]] but
there.  such an [[idea]] of [[government]] might be of some value in a new [[world]];
but we take a [[world]] already made, and formed to [[certain]] customs; we do
not beget it, as pyrrha or cadmus did.  by what means soever we may have
the [[privilege]] to redress and reform it anew, we can hardly writhe it from
its wonted bent, but we shall break all.  solon being [[asked]] whether he
had established the [[best]] laws [[law]] he could for the athenians; “yes,” said he,
“of those they would have received.”  varro excuses himself after the
same manner: “that if he were to begin to write of [[religion]], he would say
what he believed; but seeing it was already received, he would write
rather according to use than [[nature]].”

not according to [[opinion]], but in [[truth]] and reality, the [[best]] and most
excellent [[government]] for every nation is that under which it is
maintained: its form and essential convenience depend upon custom.
we are apt to be displeased at the [[present]] condition; but i,
nevertheless, maintain that to [[desire]] command in a few--[an [[oligarchy]].]--
in a [[republic]], or another sort of [[government]] in [[monarchy]] than that
already established, is both [[vice]] and folly:

              “ayme l’estat, tel que to le veois estre
               s’il est [[royal]] ayme la royaute;
               s’il est de peu, ou biers communaute,
               ayme l’aussi; car dieu t’y a faict naistre.”

     [“love the [[government]], such as you see it to be.  if it be [[royal]],
     [[love]] royalty; if it is a [[republic]] of any sort, still [[love]] it; for
     [[god]] himself created thee therein.”]

so wrote the [[good]] monsieur de pibrac, whom we have lately lost, a [[man]] of
so excellent a wit, such sound opinions [[opinion]], and such gentle manners.  this
loss, and that at the same [[time]] we have had of monsieur de foix, are of
so [[great]] importance to the [[crown]], that i do not [[know]] whether there is
another couple in [[france]] worthy to supply the places of these two gascons
in sincerity and [[wisdom]] in the council of our kings [[king]].  they were both
variously [[great]] [[men]], and certainly, according to the [[age]], rare and [[great]],
each of them in his [[kind]]: but what [[destiny]] was it that placed them in
these times [[time]], [[men]] so remote from and so disproportioned to our corruption
and intestine tumults?

nothing presses so hard upon a [[state]] as innovation: [[change]] only gives
form to [[injustice]] and [[tyranny]].  when any piece is loosened, it may be
proper to stay it; one may take [[care]] that the alteration and corruption
natural to all things do not carry us too far from our beginnings and
principles: but to undertake to found so [[great]] a mass anew, and to change
the foundations of so vast a building, is for them to do, who to make
clean, efface; who reform particular defects by an universal confusion,
and cure diseases by [[death]]:

      “non tam commutandarum quam evertendarum rerum cupidi.”

     [“not so desirous of changing as of overthrowing things.”
      --cicero, de offic., ii. i.]

the [[world]] is unapt to be cured; and so impatient of anything that presses
it, that it thinks [[think]] of nothing but disengaging itself at what price
soever.  we see by a thousand examples [[example]], that it ordinarily cures itself
to its cost.  the discharge of a [[present]] [[evil]] is no cure, if there be not
a general amendment of condition.  the surgeon’s end is not only to cut
away the [[dead]] flesh; that is but the [[progress]] of his cure; he has a [[care]],
over and above, to fill up the wound with [[better]] and more [[natural]] flesh,
and to restore the member to its due [[state]].  whoever only proposes to
himself to remove that which offends him, falls short: for [[good]] does not
necessarily succeed [[evil]]; another [[evil]] may succeed, and a worse, as it
happened to caesar’s murderers, who brought the [[republic]] to such a pass,
that they had [[reason]] to repent the meddling with the matter.  the same
has since happened to several others, even down to our own times [[time]]: the
french, my contemporaries, [[know]] it well enough.  all [[great]] mutations
shake and disorder a [[state]].

whoever would look direct at a cure, and well consider of it before he
began, would be very willing to withdraw his hands from meddling in it.
pacuvius calavius corrected the [[vice]] of this proceeding by a notable
example.  his fellow-citizens were in mutiny against their magistrates;
he being a [[man]] of [[great]] [[authority]] in the [[city]] of capua, found means one
day to shut up the senators in the palace; and calling the people
together in the market-place, there told them that the day was now come
wherein at full [[liberty]] they might [[revenge]] themselves on the tyrants [[tyrant]] by
whom they had been so long [[oppressed]], and whom he had now, all alone and
unarmed, at his [[mercy]].  he then advised that they should call these out,
one by one, by lot, and should individually determine as to each, causing
whatever should be decreed to be immediately executed; with this proviso,
that they should, at the same [[time]], depute some honest [[man]] in the place
of him who was condemned, to the end there might be no vacancy in the
senate.  they had no sooner heard the name of one senator but a [[great]] cry
of universal dislike was raised up against him.  “i see,” says pacuvius,
“that we must put him out; he is a wicked fellow; let us look out a good
one in his room.”  immediately there was a profound [[silence]], every one
being at a stand whom to choose.  but one, more impudent than the rest,
having named his [[man]], there arose yet a greater [[consent]] of voices against
him, an hundred imperfections being laid to his charge, and as many just
reasons why he should not stand.  these contradictory humours [[humour]] growing
hot, it fared worse with the second senator and the third, there being as
much disagreement in the election of the new, as [[consent]] in the putting
out of the old.  in the end, growing weary of this bustle to no [[purpose]],
they began, some one way and some another, to steal out of the assembly:
every one carrying back this resolution in his [[mind]], that the oldest and
best known [[evil]] was ever more supportable than one that was, new and
untried.

seeing how miserably we are agitated (for what have we not done!)

              “eheu! cicatricum, et sceleris pudet,
               fratrumque: quid nos dura refugimus
               aetas?  quid intactum nefasti
               liquimus?  unde manus inventus
               metu deorum continuit?  quibus
               pepercit aris.”

     [“alas! our crimes and our fratricides are a shame to us!  what
     crime does this [[bad]] [[age]] shrink from?  what wickedness have we left
     undone?  what [[youth]] is restrained from [[evil]] by the [[fear]] of the gods?
     what altar is spared?”--horace, od., i.  33, 35]

i do not presently conclude,

                              “ipsa si velit salus,
               servare prorsus non potest hanc familiam;”

     [“if the [[goddess]] salus herself [[wish]] to save this [[family]], she
     absolutely cannot”--terence, adelph., iv. 7, 43.]

we are not, peradventure, at our [[last]] gasp.  the conservation of states
is a thing that, in all likelihood, surpasses our understanding;--a civil
government is, as [[plato]] says, a mighty and puissant thing, and hard to be
dissolved; it often continues against mortal and intestine diseases,
against the injury of [[unjust]] laws [[law]], against [[tyranny]], the [[corruption]] and
ignorance of magistrates, the licence and sedition of the [[people]].  in all
our fortunes [[fortune]], we compare ourselves to what is above us, and still look
towards those who are [[better]]: but let us measure ourselves with what is
below us: there is no condition so miserable wherein a [[man]] may not find a
thousand examples [[example]] that will administer consolation.  ‘tis our [[vice]] that
we more unwillingly look upon what is above, than willingly upon what is
below; and solon was used to say, that “whoever would make a heap of all
the ills together, there is no one who would not rather choose to bear
away the ills he has than to come to an [[equal]] division with all other men
from that heap, and take his share.”  our [[government]] is, indeed, very
sick, but there have been others more sick without dying.  the gods play
at ball with us and bandy us every way:

          “enimvero dii nos homines quasi pilas habent.”

the stars fatally destined the [[state]] of [[rome]] for an [[example]] of what they
could do in this [[kind]]: in it are comprised all the forms and adventures
that concern a [[state]]: all that order or disorder, [[good]] or [[evil]] [[fortune]],
can do.  who, then, can despair of his condition, seeing the shocks and
commotions wherewith [[rome]] was tumbled and tossed, and yet withstood them
all?  if the extent of dominion be the health of a [[state]] (which i by no
means [[think]] it is, and isocrates pleases me when he instructs nicocles
not to envy princes [[prince]] who have large dominions, but those who [[know]] how to
preserve those which have fallen into their hands), that of [[rome]] was
never so sound, as when it was most sick.  the worst of her forms was the
most fortunate; one can hardly discern any image of [[government]] under the
first emperors [[emperor]]; it is the most horrible and tumultuous confusion that can
be imagined; it endured it, notwithstanding, and therein continued,
preserving not a [[monarchy]] limited within its own bounds, but so many
nations so differing, so remote, so disaffected, so confusedly commanded,
and so unjustly conquered:

              “nec gentibus ullis
               commodat in populum, terra pelagique potentem,
               invidiam fortuna suam.”

     [“fortune never gave it to any nation to satisfy its [[hatred]] against
     the [[people]], masters of the seas and of the [[earth]].”--lucan, i. 32.]

everything that totters does not fall.  the contexture of so [[great]] a body
holds by more nails than one; it holds even by its antiquity, like old
buildings, from which the foundations are worn away by [[time]], without
rough-cast or mortar, which yet [[live]] and support themselves by their own
weight:

                   “nec jam validis radicibus haerens,
                    pondere tuta suo est.”

moreover, it is not rightly to go to [[work]], to examine only the flank and
the foss, to [[judge]] of the security of a place; we must observe which way
approaches can be made to it, and in what condition the assailant is: few
vessels sink with their own weight, and without some exterior [[violence]].
now, let us everyway cast our [[eyes]]; everything about us totters; in all
the [[great]] states, both of christendom and elsewhere, that are known to
us, if you will but look, you will there see evident menace of alteration
and ruin:

         “et sua sunt illis incommoda; parque per omnes
          tempestas.”

          [“they all share in the mischief; the tempest rages
          everywhere.”--aeneid, ii.]

astrologers may very well, as they do, warn us of [[great]] revolutions [[revolution]] and
imminent mutations: their prophecies are [[present]] and palpable, they need
not go to [[heaven]] to foretell this.  there is not only consolation to be
extracted from this universal combination of ills and menaces, but,
moreover, some hopes [[hope]] of the continuation of our [[state]], forasmuch as,
naturally, nothing falls where all falls: universal sickness is
particular health: conformity is antagonistic to dissolution.  for my
part, i despair not, and fancy that i discover ways to save us:

                   “deus haec fortasse benigna
                    reducet in sedem [[vice]].”

     [“the deity will perchance by a favourable turn restore us to our
     former position.”--horace, epod., xiii. 7.]

who knows [[know]] but that [[god]] will have it happen, as in [[human]] bodies [[body]] that purge
and restore themselves to a [[better]] [[state]] by long and grievous maladies,
which render them more entire and [[perfect]] health than that they took from
them?  that which weighs the most with me is, that in reckoning the
symptoms of our ill, i see as many [[natural]] ones, and that [[heaven]] sends
us, and properly its own, as of those that our disorder and human
imprudence contribute to it.  the very stars seem to declare that we have
already continued long enough, and beyond the ordinary term.  this also
afflicts me, that the mischief which nearest threatens us, is not an
alteration in the entire and solid mass, but its dissipation and
divulsion, which is the most extreme of our fears [[fear]].

i, moreover, [[fear]], in these fantasies of mine, the treachery of my
memory, lest, by inadvertence, it should make me write the same thing
twice.  i hate to examine myself, and never review, but very unwillingly,
what has once escaped my pen.  i here set down nothing new.  these are
common thoughts [[thought]], and having, peradventure, conceived them an hundred
times, i am afraid i have set them down somewhere else already.
repetition is everywhere troublesome, though it were in [[homer]]; but ‘tis
ruinous in things that have only a superficial and transitory show.  i do
not [[love]] over-insisting, even in the most profitable things, as in
seneca; and the usage of his stoical school displeases me, to repeat,
upon every [[subject]], at full length and width the principles [[principle]] and
presuppositions that serve in general, and always to realledge anew
common and universal reasons [[reason]].

my memory grows cruelly worse every day:

                   “pocula lethaeos ut si ducentia somnos,
                    arente fauce traxerim;”

     [“as if my dry throat had drunk seducing cups of lethaean
     oblivion.”--horace, epod., xiv. 3.]

i must be fain for the [[time]] to come (for hitherto, thanks be to [[god]],
nothing has happened much amiss), whereas others seek [[time]] and
opportunity to [[think]] of what they have to say, to avoid all preparation,
for [[fear]] of tying myself to some obligation upon which i must insist.  to
be tied and bound to a thing puts me quite out, and to depend upon so
weak an instrument as my memory.  i never [[read]] this following story that
i am not offended at it with a personal and [[natural]] resentment:
lyncestes, accused of conspiracy against alexander, the day that he was
brought out before the [[army]], according to the custom, to be heard as to
what he could say for himself, had learned a [[studied]] [[speech]], of which,
hesitating and stammering, he pronounced some words.  whilst growing more
and more perplexed, whilst struggling with his memory, and trying to
recollect what he had to say, the soldiers nearest to him charged their
pikes against him and killed him, looking upon him as convict; his
confusion and [[silence]] served them for a [[confession]]; for having had so
much leisure to prepare himself in prison, they concluded that it was not
his memory that failed him, but that his [[conscience]] tied up his tongue
and stopped his mouth.  and, truly, well said; the place, the assembly,
the expectation, astound a [[man]], even when he has but the [[ambition]] to
speak well; what can a [[man]] do when ‘tis an harangue upon which his life
depends?

for my part, the very being tied to what i am to say is enough to loose
me from it.  when i wholly commit and refer myself to my memory, i lay so
much stress upon it that it sinks under me: it grows dismayed with the
burden.  so much as i trust to it, so much do i put myself out of my own
power, even to the finding it difficult to keep my own countenance; and
have been sometimes very much put to it to conceal the [[slavery]] wherein i
was engaged; whereas my design is to manifest, in speaking, a perfect
calmness both of face and accent, and casual and unpremeditated motions,
as rising from [[present]] occasions [[occasion]], choosing rather to say nothing to
purpose than to show that i came prepared to speak well, a thing
especially unbecoming a [[man]] of my profession, and of too [[great]] obligation
on him who cannot retain much.  the preparation begets a [[great]] deal more
expectation than it will satisfy.  a [[man]] often strips himself to his
doublet to leap no farther than he would have done in his gown:

          “nihil est his, qui placere volunt, turn adversarium,
          quam expectatio.”

     [“nothing is so adverse to those who make it their [[business]] to
     please as expectation”--cicero, acad., ii. 4]

it is recorded of the orator curio, that when he proposed the division of
his oration into three or four parts, or three or four arguments or
reasons, it often happened either that he forgot some one, or added one
or two more.  i have always avoided falling into this inconvenience,
having ever hated these promises and prescriptions, not only out of
distrust of my memory, but also because this method relishes too much of
the artist:

                    “simpliciora militares decent.”

     [“simplicity becomes warriors.”--quintilian, instit. orat., xi. i.]

‘tis enough that i have promised to myself never again to take upon me
to speak in a place of [[respect]], for as to speaking, when a [[man]] reads his
speech, besides that it is very absurd, it is a mighty disadvantage to
those who naturally could give it a grace by action; and to rely upon the
mercy of my [[present]] invention, i would much less do it; ‘tis heavy and
perplexed, and such as would never furnish me in sudden and important
necessities.

permit, reader, this essay its course also, and this third sitting to
finish the rest of my picture: i add, but i [[correct]] not.  first, because
i conceive that a [[man]] having once parted with his labours [[labour]] to the [[world]],
he has no further [[right]] to them; let him do [[better]] if he can, in some new
undertaking, but not adulterate what he has already sold.  of such
dealers nothing should be bought till after they are [[dead]].  let them well
consider what they do before they, [[produce]] it to the [[light]] who hastens
them?  my [[book]] is always the same, saving that upon every new edition
(that the buyer may not go away quite empty) i take the [[liberty]] to add
(as ‘tis but an ill jointed marqueterie) some supernumerary emblem; it is
but overweight, that does not disfigure the primitive form of the essays,
but, by a little artful subtlety, gives a [[kind]] of particular value to
every one of those that [[follow]].  thence, however, will easily happen some
transposition of chronology, my stories taking place according to their
opportuneness, not always according to their [[age]].

secondly, because as to what concerns myself, i [[fear]] to lose by [[change]]:
my understanding does not always go forward, it goes backward too.  i do
not much less suspect my fancies for being the second or the third, than
for being the first, or [[present]], or [[past]]; we often [[correct]] ourselves as
foolishly as we do others.  i am grown older by a [[great]] many years since
my first publications, which were in the year 1580; but i very much doubt
whether i am grown an inch the wiser.  i now, and i anon, are two several
persons; but whether [[better]], i cannot determine.  it were a fine thing to
be old, if we only travelled towards improvement; but ‘tis a drunken,
stumbling, reeling, infirm motion: like that of reeds, which the air
casually waves to and fro at [[pleasure]].  antiochus had in his youth
strongly written in favour of the academy; in his old [[age]] he wrote as
much against it; would not, which of these two soever i should [[follow]], be
still antiochus?  after having established the uncertainty, to go about
to establish the certainty of [[human]] opinions [[opinion]], was it not to establish
doubt, and not certainty, and to promise, that had he had yet another age
to [[live]], he would be always upon terms of altering his [[judgment]], not so
much for the [[better]], as for something else?

the [[public]] favour has given me a little more confidence than i expected;
but what i ‘most [[fear]] is, lest i should glut the [[world]] with my writings;
i had rather, of the two, pique my reader than tire him, as a learned man
of my [[time]] has done.  [[praise]] is always pleasing, let it come from whom,
or upon what account it will; yet ought a [[man]] to [[understand]] why he is
commended, that he may [[know]] how to keep up the same [[reputation]] still:
imperfections themselves may get commendation.  the vulgar and common
estimation is seldom [[happy]] in hitting; and i am much mistaken if, amongst
the writings of my [[time]], the worst are not those which have most gained
the popular applause.  for my part, i return my thanks to those
good-natured [[men]] who are pleased to take my [[weak]] endeavours in [[good]] part;
the faults [[fault]] of the workmanship are nowhere so apparent as in a matter
which of itself has no recommendation.  blame not me, reader, for those
that slip in here by the fancy or inadvertency of others; every hand,
every artisan, contribute their own materials; i neither concern myself
with orthography (and only [[care]] to have it after the old way) nor
pointing, being very inexpert both in the one and the other.  where they
wholly break the sense, i am very little concerned, for they at least
discharge me; but where they substitute a false one, as they so often do,
and wrest me to their conception, they ruin me.  when the sentence,
nevertheless, is not [[strong]] enough for my proportion, a civil person
ought to reject it as spurious, and none of mine.  whoever shall [[know]] how
lazy i am, and how indulgent to my own [[humour]], will easily [[believe]] that i
had rather write as many more essays, than be tied to revise these over
again for so childish a correction.

i said elsewhere, that being planted in the very centre of this new
religion, i am not only deprived of any [[great]] familiarity with [[men]] of
other [[kind]] of manners than my own, and of other opinions [[opinion]], by which they
hold together, as by a tie that supersedes all other obligations; but
moreover i do not [[live]] without danger, amongst [[men]] to whom all things are
equally lawful, and of whom the most part cannot offend the laws [[law]] more
than they have already done; from which the extremist [[degree]] of licence
proceeds.  all the particular being summed up together, i do not find one
man of my [[country]], who pays [[pay]] so dear for the defence of our laws [[law]] both in
loss and damages (as the lawyers say) as myself; and some there are who
vapour and brag of their zeal and constancy, that if things were justly
weighed, do much less than i.  my house, as one that has ever been open
and [[free]] to all comers, and civil to all (for i could never persuade
myself to make it a garrison of [[war]], [[war]] being a thing that i prefer to
see as remote as may be), has sufficiently merited popular [[kindness]], and
so that it would be a hard matter justly to insult over me upon my own
dunghill; and i look upon it as a wonderful and exemplary thing that it
yet continues a virgin from [[blood]] and plunder during so long a storm, and
so many neighbouring revolutions [[revolution]] and tumults.  for to confess the [[truth]],
it had been possible enough for a [[man]] of my [[complexion]] to have shaken
hands with any one constant and continued form whatever; but the contrary
invasions and incursions, alternations and vicissitudes of [[fortune]] round
about me, have hitherto more exasperated than calmed and mollified the
temper of the [[country]], and involved me, over and over again, with
invincible difficulties and dangers.

i escape, ‘tis true, but am troubled that it is more by [[chance]], and
something of my own prudence, than by [[justice]]; and am not satisfied to be
out of the protection of the laws [[law]], and under any other safeguard than
theirs.  as matters stand, i [[live]], above one half, by the favour of
others, which is an untoward obligation.  i do not like to owe my safety
either to the generosity or affection of [[great]] persons [[person]], who allow me my
legality and my [[liberty]], or to the obliging manners of my predecessors,
or my own: for what if i were another [[kind]] of [[man]]?  if my deportment, and
the frankness of my conversation or relationship, oblige my neighbours,
‘tis that that they should acquit themselves of obligation in only
permitting me to [[live]], and they may say, “we allow him the [[free]] liberty
of having [[divine]] service [[read]] in his own private chapel, when it is
interdicted in all churches [[church]] round about, and allow him the use of his
goods and his [[life]], as one who protects our wives [[wife]] and cattle in [[time]] of
need.”  for my house has for many descents shared in the [[reputation]] of
lycurgus the athenian, who was the general depository and guardian of the
purses of his fellow-citizens.  now i am clearly of [[opinion]] that a man
should [[live]] by [[right]] and by [[authority]], and not either by recompense or
favour.  how many gallant [[men]] have rather chosen to lose their lives [[life]] than
to be debtors for them?  i hate to [[subject]] myself to any sort of
obligation, but above all, to that which binds me by the [[duty]] of [[honour]].
i [[think]] nothing so dear as what has been given me, and this because my
will lies [[lie]] at pawn under the title of gratitude, and more willingly accept
of services that are to be sold; i [[feel]] that for the [[last]] i give nothing
but [[money]], but for the other i give myself.

the knot that binds me by the laws [[law]] of courtesy binds me more than that of
civil constraint; i am much more at ease when bound by a scrivener, than
by myself.  is it not [[reason]] that my [[conscience]] should be much more
engaged when [[men]] simply rely upon it?  in a bond, my [[faith]] owes nothing,
because it has nothing lent it; let them trust to the security they have
taken without me.  i had much rather break the wall of a prison and the
laws themselves than my own word.  i am nice, even to superstition, in
keeping my promises, and, therefore, upon all occasions [[occasion]] have a [[care]] to
make them uncertain and conditional.  to those of no [[great]] moment, i add
the [[jealousy]] of my own [[rule]], to make them weight; it wracks and oppresses
me with its own interest.  even in actions wholly my own and [[free]], if i
once say a thing, i conceive that i have bound myself, and that
delivering it to the [[knowledge]] of another, i have positively enjoined it
my own performance.  methinks i promise it, if i but say it: and
therefore am not apt to say much of that [[kind]].  the sentence that i pass
upon myself is more severe than that of a [[judge]], who only considers the
common obligation; but my [[conscience]] looks upon it with a more severe and
penetrating eye.  i lag in those duties [[duty]] to which i should be compelled if
i did not go:

     “hoc ipsum ita justum est, quod recte fit, si est voluntarium.”

     [“this itself is so far just, that it is rightly done, if it is
     voluntary.”--cicero, de offic., i. 9.]

if the action has not some splendour of [[liberty]], it has neither grace nor
honour:

          “quod vos jus cogit, vix voluntate impetrent:”

     [“that which the laws [[law]] compel us to do, we scarcely do with a will.”
      --terence, adelph., iii. 3, 44.]

where necessity draws me, i [[love]] to let my will take its own course:

          “quia quicquid imperio cogitur, exigenti magis,
          quam praestanti, acceptum refertur.”

     [“for whatever is compelled by [[power]], is more imputed to him that
     exacts than to him that performs.”--valerius maximus, ii. 2, 6.]

i [[know]] some who [[follow]] this [[rule]], even to [[injustice]]; who will sooner give
than restore, sooner lend than [[pay]], and will do them the least [[good]] to
whom they are most obliged.  i don’t go so far as that, but i’m not far
off.

i so much [[love]] to disengage and disobligate myself, that i have sometimes
looked upon ingratitudes, affronts, and indignities which i have received
from those to whom either by [[nature]] or accident i was bound in some way
of [[friendship]], as an advantage to me; taking this [[occasion]] of their
ill-usage, for an acquaintance and discharge of so much of my debt.  and
though i still continue to [[pay]] them all the external offices of public
reason, i, notwithstanding, find a [[great]] saving in doing that upon the
account of [[justice]] which i did upon the score of affection, and am a
little eased of the attention and solicitude of my inward will:

     “est prudentis sustinere, ut currum, sic impetum benevolentia;”

     [“‘tis the part of a [[wise]] [[man]] to keep a curbing hand upon the
     impetus of [[friendship]], as upon that of his horse.”
      --cicero, de amicit., c. 17.]

‘tis in me, too urging and pressing where i take; at least, for a [[man]] who
loves not to be strained at all.  and this husbanding my friendship
serves me for a sort of consolation in the imperfections of those in whom
i am concerned.  i am very [[sorry]] they are not such as i could [[wish]] they
were, but then i also am spared somewhat of my application and engagement
towards them.  i approve of a [[man]] who is the less fond of his child for
having a scald head, or for being crooked; and not only when he is
ill-conditioned, but also when he is of unhappy disposition, and imperfect
in his limbs (god himself has abated so much from his value and natural
estimation), provided he carry himself in this coldness of affection with
moderation and exact [[justice]]: proximity, with me, lessens not defects,
but rather aggravates them.

after all, according to what i [[understand]] in the [[science]] of benefit and
acknowledgment, which is a subtle [[science]], and of [[great]] use, i [[know]] no
person whatever more [[free]] and less indebted than i am at this hour.  what
i do owe is simply to [[foreign]] obligations and benefits; as to anything
else, no [[man]] is more absolutely clear:

                   “nec sunt mihi nota potentum
                    munera.”

     [“the gifts of [[great]] [[men]] are unknown to me.”--aeneid, xii. 529.]

princes give me a [[great]] deal if they take nothing from me; and do me good
enough if they do me no harm; that’s all i ask from them.  o how am i
obliged to [[god]], that he has been pleased i should immediately receive
from his bounty all i have, and specially reserved all my obligation to
himself.  how earnestly do i beg of his holy compassion that i may never
owe essential thanks to any one.  o [[happy]] [[liberty]] wherein i have thus far
lived.  may it continue with me to the [[last]].  i endeavour to have no
express need of any one:

                    “in me omnis spec est mihi.”

     [“all my [[hope]] is in myself.”--terence, adelph., iii. 5, 9.]

‘tis what every one may do in himself, but more easily they whom [[god]] has
placed in a condition exempt from [[natural]] and urgent necessities.  it is
a wretched and dangerous thing to depend upon others; we ourselves, in
whom is ever the most just and safest dependence, are not sufficiently
sure.

i have nothing mine but myself, and yet the possession is, in part,
defective and borrowed.  i fortify myself both in [[courage]], which is the
strongest assistant, and also in [[fortune]], therein wherewith to satisfy
myself, though everything else should forsake me.  hippias of elis not
only furnished himself with [[knowledge]], that he might, at need, cheerfully
retire from all other company to enjoy the muses: nor only with the
knowledge of [[philosophy]], to [[teach]] his [[soul]] to be contented with itself,
and bravely to subsist without outward conveniences, when [[fate]] would have
it so; he was, moreover, so careful as to learn to cook, to shave
himself, to make his own clothes, his own shoes and drawers, to provide
for all his necessities in himself, and to wean himself from the
assistance of others.  a [[man]] more freely and cheerfully enjoys borrowed
conveniences, when it is not an enjoyment forced and constrained by need;
and when he has, in his own will and [[fortune]], the means to [[live]] without
them.  i [[know]] myself very well; but ‘tis hard for me to imagine any so
pure liberality of any one towards me, any so frank and [[free]] hospitality,
that would not appear to me discreditable, [[tyrannical]], and tainted with
reproach, if necessity had reduced me to it.  as giving is an ambitious
and authoritative quality, so is accepting a quality of submission;
witness the insulting and quarrelsome refusal that bajazet made of the
presents that tamerlane sent him; and those that were offered on the part
of the [[emperor]] solyman to the [[emperor]] of calicut, so angered him, that he
not only rudely rejected them, saying that neither he nor any of his
predecessors had ever been wont to take, and that it was their office to
give; but, moreover, caused the ambassadors sent with the gifts to be put
into a dungeon.  when thetis, says [[aristotle]], flatters [[jupiter]], when the
lacedaemonians flatter the athenians, they do not put them in [[mind]] of the
good they have done them, which is always odious, but of the benefits
they have received from them.  such as i see so frequently employ every
one in their affairs, and thrust themselves into so much obligation,
would never do it, did they but relish as i do the sweetness of a pure
liberty, and did they but weigh, as [[wise]]: [[men]] should, the burden of
obligation: ‘tis sometimes, peradventure, fully paid, but ‘tis never
dissolved.  ‘tis a miserable [[slavery]] to a [[man]] who loves [[love]] to be at full
liberty in all reapects.  such as [[know]] me, both above and below me in
station, are able to say whether they have ever known a [[man]] less
importuning, soliciting, entreating, and pressing upon others than i.
if i am so, and a [[degree]] beyond all [[modern]] [[example]], ‘tis no [[great]] wonder,
so many parts of my manners contributing to it: a little [[natural]] [[pride]],
an [[impatience]] at being refused, the moderation of my desires [[desire]] and designs,
my incapacity for [[business]], and my most beloved qualities, idleness and
freedom; by all these together i have conceived a mortal [[hatred]] to being
obliged to any other, or by any other than myself.  i leave no stone
unturned, to do without it, rather than employ the bounty of another in
any [[light]] or important [[occasion]] or necessity whatever.  my friends
strangely trouble me when they ask me to ask a third [[person]]; and i think
it costs me little less to disengage him who is indebted to me, by making
use of him, than to engage myself to him who owes me nothing.  these
conditions being removed, and provided they require of me nothing if any
great trouble or [[care]] (for i have declared mortal [[war]] against all care),
i am very ready to do every one the [[best]] service i can.  i have been very
willing to seek [[occasion]] to do [[people]] a [[good]] turn, and to attach them to
me; and methinks there is no more agreeable employment for our means.
but i have yet more avoided receiving than sought occasions [[occasion]] of giving,
and moreover, according to [[aristotle]], it is more easy., my [[fortune]] has
allowed me but little to do others [[good]] withal, and the little it can
afford, is put into a pretty close hand.  had i been born a [[great]] [[person]],
i should have been ambitious to have made myself beloved, not to make
myself feared or admired: shall i more plainly express it?  i should more
have endeavoured to please than to [[profit]] others.  cyrus very wisely, and
by the mouth of a [[great]] captain, and still greater philosopher, prefers
his bounty and benefits much before his valour and warlike conquests;
and the elder scipio, wherever he would raise himself in esteem, sets a
higher value upon his affability and [[humanity]], than on his prowess and
victories, and has always this glorious saying in his mouth: “that he has
given his enemies [[enemy]] as much [[occasion]] to [[love]] him as his [[friends]].”  i will
then say, that if a [[man]] must, of necessity, owe something, it ought to be
by a more legitimate title than that whereof i am speaking, to which the
necessity of this miserable [[war]] compels me; and not in so [[great]] a debt as
that of my total preservation both of [[life]] and [[fortune]]: it overwhelms me.

i have a thousand times [[time]] gone to bed in my own house with an apprehension
that i should be betrayed and murdered that very night; compounding with
fortune, that it might be without terror and with quick despatch; and,
after my paternoster, i have cried out,

          “impius haec tam culta novalia miles habebit!”

     [“shall impious soldiers have these new-ploughed grounds?”
      --virgil, ecl., i. 71.]

what remedy?  ‘tis the place of my birth, and that of most of my
ancestors; they have here fixed their affection and name.  we inure
ourselves to whatever we are accustomed to; and in so miserable a
condition as ours is, custom is a [[great]] bounty of [[nature]], which benumbs
out senses to the sufferance of many evils [[evil]].  a civil [[war]] has this with it
worse than other wars [[war]] have, to make us stand sentinels in our own houses.

              “quam miserum, porta vitam muroque tueri,
               vixque suae tutum viribus esse domus!”

     [“‘tis miserable to [[protect]] one’s [[life]] by doors and walls, and to be
     scarcely safe in one’s own house.”--ovid, trist., iv. i, 69.]

‘tis a grievous extremity for a [[man]] to be jostled even in his own house
and domestic repose.  the [[country]] where i [[live]] is always the first in
arms and the [[last]] that lays them down, and where there is never an
absolute [[peace]]:

         “tunc quoque, cum pax est, trepidant formidine belli....
          quoties romam fortuna lacessit;
          hac iter est bellis....  melius, fortuna, dedisses
          orbe sub eco sedem, gelidaque sub arcto,
          errantesque domos.”

     [“even when there’s [[peace]], there is here still the dear of [[war]] when
     [[fortune]] troubles [[peace]], this is ever the way by which [[war]] passes.”
      --ovid, trist., iii. 10, 67.]

     [“we might have lived happier in the remote east or in the icy
     north, or among the wandering tribes.”--lucan, i. 255.]

i sometimes extract the means to fortify myself against these
considerations from indifference and indolence, which, in some sort,
bring us on to resolution.  it often befalls me to imagine and expect
mortal dangers with a [[kind]] of delight: i stupidly plunge myself headlong
into [[death]], without considering or taking a view of it, as into a deep
and obscure abyss which swallows me up at one leap, and involves me in an
instant in a profound sleep, without any sense of [[pain]].  and in these
short and [[violent]] deaths [[death]], the consequence that i foresee administers more
consolation to me than the effect does [[fear]].  they say, that as [[life]] is
not [[better]] for being long, so [[death]] is [[better]] for being not long.  i do
not so much evade being [[dead]], as i enter into confidence with dying.  i
wrap and shroud myself into the storm that is to blind and carry me away
with the fury of a sudden and insensible attack.  moreover, if it should
fall out that, as some gardeners say, roses and violets spring more
odoriferous near garlic and onions, by [[reason]] that the [[last]] suck and
imbibe all the ill odour of the [[earth]]; so, if these depraved natures
should also attract all the malignity of my air and [[climate]], and render
it so much [[better]] and purer by their vicinity, i should not lose all.
that cannot be: but there may be something in this, that goodness is more
beautiful and attractive when it is rare; and that contrariety and
diversity fortify and consolidate well-doing within itself, and inflame
it by the [[jealousy]] of opposition and by [[glory]].  thieves and robbers, of
their special favour, have no particular spite at me; no more have i to
them: i should have my hands too full.  like consciences are lodged under
several sorts of robes; like [[cruelty]], disloyalty, rapine; and so much the
worse, and more falsely, when the more secure and concealed under colour
of the laws [[law]].  i less hate an open professed injury than one that is
treacherous; an [[enemy]] in arms, than an [[enemy]] in a gown.  our fever has
seized upon a [[body]] that is not much the worse for it; there was fire
before, and now ‘tis broken out into a flame; the noise is greater, not
the [[evil]].  i ordinarily [[answer]] such as ask me the [[reason]] of my travels,
“that i [[know]] very well what i fly from, but not what i seek.”  if they
tell me that there may be as little soundness amongst foreigners, and
that their manners are no [[better]] than ours: i first reply, that it is
hard to be believed;

                    “tam multa: scelerum facies!”

     [“there are so many forms of crime.”--virgil, georg., i. 506.]

secondly, that it is always gain to [[change]] an ill condition for one that
is uncertain; and that the ills of others ought not to afflict us so much
as our own.

i will not here omit, that i never mutiny so much against [[france]], that i
am not perfectly [[friends]] with [[paris]]; that [[city]] has ever had my [[heart]] from
my infancy, and it has fallen out, as of excellent things, that the more
beautiful cities [[city]] i have seen since, the more the [[beauty]] of this still
wins upon my affection.  i [[love]] her for herself, and more in her own
native being, than in all the pomp of [[foreign]] and acquired
embellishments.  i [[love]] her tenderly, even to her warts and blemishes.
i am a frenchman only through this [[great]] [[city]], [[great]] in [[people]], [[great]] in
the felicity of her situation; but, above all, [[great]] and incomparable in
variety and [[diversity]] of commodities: the [[glory]] of [[france]], and one of the
most [[noble]] ornaments of the [[world]].  may [[god]] drive our divisions far from
her.  entire and [[united]], i [[think]] her sufficiently defended from all other
violences.  i give her caution that, of all sorts of [[people]], those will
be the worst that shall set her in discord; i have no [[fear]] for her, but
of herself, and, certainly, i have as much [[fear]] for her as for any other
part of the [[kingdom]].  whilst she shall continue, i shall never want a
retreat, where i may stand at bay, sufficient to make me amends for
parting with any other retreat.

not because [[socrates]] has said so, but because it is in [[truth]] my own
humour, and peradventure not without some excess, i look upon all [[men]] as
my compatriots, and embrace a polander as a frenchman, preferring the
universal and [[common]] tie to all national ties whatever.  i am not much
taken with the sweetness of a native air: acquaintance wholly new and
wholly my own appear to me full as [[good]] as the other [[common]] and
fortuitous ones with four neighbours: friendships [[friendship]] that are purely of our
own acquiring ordinarily carry it above those to which the communication
of [[climate]] or of [[blood]] oblige us.  [[nature]] has placed us in the [[world]] free
and unbound; we imprison ourselves in [[certain]] straits, like the kings [[king]] of
persia, who obliged themselves to drink no other water but that of the
river choaspes, foolishly quitted claim to their [[right]] in all other
streams, and, so far as concerned themselves, dried up all the other
rivers of the [[world]].  what [[socrates]] did towards his end, to look upon a
sentence of [[banishment]] as worse than a sentence of [[death]] against him, i
shall, i [[think]], never be either so decrepid or so strictly habituated to
my own [[country]] to be of that [[opinion]].  these celestial lives [[life]] have images
enough that i embrace more by esteem than affection; and they have some
also so elevated and extraordinary that i cannot embrace them so much as
by esteem, forasmuch as i cannot conceive them.  that fancy was singular
in a [[man]] who [[thought]] the whole [[world]] his [[city]]; it is true that he
disdained travel, and had hardly ever set his foot out of the attic
territories.  what say you to his complaint of the [[money]] his friends
offered to save his [[life]], and that he refused to come out of prison by
the mediation of others, in order not to disobey the laws [[law]] in a [[time]] when
they were otherwise so [[corrupt]]?  these examples [[example]] are of the first [[kind]] for
me; of the second, there are others that i could find out in the same
person: many of these rare examples [[example]] surpass the [[force]] of my action, but
some of them, moreover, surpass the [[force]] of my [[judgment]].

besides these reasons [[reason]], travel is in my [[opinion]] a very profitable
exercise; the [[soul]] is there continually employed in observing new and
unknown things, and i do not [[know]], as i have often said a [[better]] school
wherein to model [[life]] than by incessantly exposing to it the diversity
of so many other lives [[life]], fancies, and usances, and by making it relish a
perpetual variety of forms of [[human]] [[nature]].  the [[body]] is, therein,
neither idle nor overwrought; and that moderate agitation puts it in
breath.  i can keep on horseback, tormented with the stone as i am,
without alighting or being weary, eight or ten hours together:

               “vires ultra sorternque senectae.”

     [“beyond the [[strength]] and lot of [[age]].”--aeneid, vi. 114.]

no season is [[enemy]] to me but the parching heat of a scorching sun; for
the umbrellas made use of in [[italy]], ever since the [[time]] of the ancient
romans, more burden a man’s arm than they relieve his head.  i would fain
know how it was that the persians, so long ago and in the infancy of
luxury, made ventilators where they wanted them, and planted shades, as
xenophon reports they did.  i [[love]] rain, and to dabble in the dirt, as
well as ducks do.  the [[change]] of air and [[climate]] never touches me; every
sky is alike; i am only troubled with inward alterations which i breed
within myself, and those are not so frequent in travel.  i am hard to be
got out, but being once upon the road, i hold out as well as the [[best]].
i take as much pains [[pain]] in little as in [[great]] attempts, and am as solicitous
to equip myself for a short [[journey]], if but to visit a neighbour, as for
the longest [[voyage]].  i have learned to travel after the spanish [[fashion]],
and to make but one stage of a [[great]] many miles; and in excessive heats
i always travel by night, from sun set to sunrise.  the other method of
baiting by the way, in haste and hurry to gobble up a dinner, is,
especially in short days, very inconvenient.  my horses perform the
better; never any horse tired under me that was able to hold out the
first day’s [[journey]].  i water them at every brook i meet, and have only a
care they have so much way to go before i come to my inn, as will digest
the water in their bellies.  my unwillingness to rise in a morning gives
my servants leisure to dine at their ease before they set out; for my own
part, i never [[eat]] too late; my appetite comes to me in eating, and not
else; i am never hungry but at table.

some of my [[friends]] blame me for continuing this travelling [[humour]], being
married and old.  but they are out in’t; ‘tis the [[best]] [[time]] to leave a
man’s house, when he has put it into a way of continuing without him, and
settled such order as corresponds with its former [[government]].  ‘tis much
greater imprudence to abandon it to a less faithful housekeeper, and who
will be less solicitous to look after your affairs.

the most useful and honourable [[knowledge]] and employment for the [[mother]] of
a [[family]] is the [[science]] of [[good]] housewifery.  i see some that are
covetous indeed, but very few that are [[good]] managers.  ‘tis the supreme
quality of a woman, which a [[man]] ought to seek before any other, as the
only dowry that must ruin or preserve our houses.  let [[men]] say what they
will, according to the [[experience]] i have learned, i require in married
women the economical [[virtue]] above all other virtues [[virtue]]; i put my [[wife]] to’t,
as a concern of her own, leaving her, by my absence, the whole government
of my affairs.  i see, and am vexed to see, in several families [[family]] i [[know]],
monsieur about noon come [[home]] all jaded and ruffled about his affairs,
when madame is still dressing her hair and tricking up herself, forsooth,
in her closet: this is for queens to do, and that’s a [[question]], too: ‘tis
ridiculous and [[unjust]] that the laziness of our wives [[wife]] should be maintained
with our sweat and [[labour]].  no [[man]], so far as in me [[lie]], shall have a
clearer, a more quiet and [[free]] fruition of his estate than i.  if the
husband bring matter, [[nature]] herself will that the [[wife]] find the form.

as to the duties [[duty]] of conjugal [[friendship]], that some [[think]] to be impaired
by these absences, i am quite of another [[opinion]].  it is, on the
contrary, an [[intelligence]] that easily cools by a too frequent and
assiduous companionship.  every [[strange]] woman appears charming, and we
all find by [[experience]] that being continually together is not so pleasing
as to part for a [[time]] and meet again.  these interruptions fill me with
fresh affection towards my [[family]], and render my house more pleasant to
me.  [[change]] warms my appetite to the one and then to the other.  i know
that the arms of [[friendship]] are long enough to reach from the one end of
the [[world]] to the other, and especially this, where there is a continual
communication of offices that rouse the obligation and remembrance.  the
stoics say that there is so [[great]] connection and relation amongst the
sages, that he who dines in [[france]] nourishes his companion in [[egypt]]; and
that whoever does but hold out his finger, in what part of the world
soever, all the sages upon the habitable [[earth]] [[feel]] themselves assisted
by it.  fruition and possession principally appertain to the [[imagination]];
it more fervently and constantly embraces what it is in quest of, than
what we hold in our arms.  cast up your daily amusements; you will find
that you are most absent from your friend when he is [[present]] with you;
his presence relaxes your attention, and gives you [[liberty]] to absent
yourself at every turn and upon every [[occasion]].  when i am away at [[rome]],
i keep and govern my house, and the conveniences i there left; see my
walls rise, my trees shoot, and my [[revenue]] increase or decrease, very
near as well as when i am there:

          “ante oculos errat domus, errat forma locorum.”

     [“my house and the forms of places float before my eyes”
      --ovid, trist, iii. 4, 57.]

if we enjoy nothing but what we touch, we may say farewell to the money
in our chests, and to our sons [[son]] when they are gone a hunting.  we will
have them nearer to us: is the garden, or half a day’s [[journey]] from [[home]],
far?  what is ten leagues: far or near?  if near, what is eleven, twelve,
or thirteen, and so by degrees [[degree]].  in earnest, if there be a woman who can
tell her husband what step ends the near and what step begins the remote,
i would advise her to stop between;

              “excludat jurgia finis .  .  .  .
               utor permisso; caudaeque pilos ut equinae
               paulatim vello, et demo unum, demo etiam unum
               dum cadat elusus ratione ruentis acervi:”

     [“let the end shut out all disputes .  .  .  .  i use what is
     permitted; i pluck out the hairs of the horse’s tail one by one;
     while i thus outwit my opponent.”--horace, ep., ii, i, 38, 45]

and let them boldly call [[philosophy]] to their assistance; in whose teeth
it may be cast that, seeing it neither discerns the one nor the other end
of the joint, betwixt the too much and the little, the long and the
short, the [[light]] and the heavy, the near and the remote; that seeing it
discovers neither the beginning nor the end, it must needs [[judge]] very
uncertainly of the middle:

          “rerum natura nullam nobis dedit cognitionem finium.”

     [“nature has green to us no [[knowledge]] of the end of things.”
      --cicero, acad., ii. 29.]

are they not still wives [[wife]] and [[friends]] to the [[dead]] who are not at the end
of this but in the other [[world]]?  we embrace not only the absent, but
those who have been, and those who are not yet.  we do not promise in
marriage to be continually twisted and linked together, like some little
animals that we see, or, like the bewitched folks of karenty,--[karantia,
a town in the isle of rugen.  see saxo-grammaticus, hist.  of denmark,
book xiv.]--tied together like dogs; and a [[wife]] ought not to be so
greedily enamoured of her husband’s foreparts, that she cannot endure to
see him turn his back, if [[occasion]] be.  but may not this saying of that
excellent painter of woman’s humours [[humour]] be here introduced, to show the
reason of their complaints?

         “uxor, si cesses, aut to amare cogitat,
          aut tete amari, aut potare, aut animo obsequi;
          et tibi bene esse soli, cum sibi sit male;”

     [“your [[wife]], if you loiter, thinks [[think]] that you [[love]] or are beloved; or
     that you are drinking or following your inclination; and that it is
     well for you when it is ill for her (all the [[pleasure]] is yours and
     hers all the care).”
      --terence, adelph., act i., sc. i, v.  7.]

or may it not be, that of itself opposition and contradiction entertain
and nourish them, and that they sufficiently accommodate themselves,
provided they incommodate you?

in true [[friendship]], wherein i am [[perfect]], i more give myself to my
friend, than i endeavour to attract him to me.  i am not only better
pleased in doing him service than if he conferred a benefit upon me,
but, moreover, had rather he should do himself [[good]] than me, and he most
obliges me when he does so; and if absence be either more pleasant or
convenient for him, ‘tis also more acceptable to me than his presence;
neither is it properly absence, when we can write to one another: i have
sometimes made [[good]] use of our separation from one another: we better
filled and further extended the possession of [[life]] in being parted.
he--[la boetie.]--lived, enjoyed, and saw for me, and i for him, as
fully as if he had himself been there; one part of us remained idle, and
we were too much blended in one another when we were together; the
distance of place rendered the conjunction of our wills more [[rich]].  this
insatiable [[desire]] of personal presence a little implies weakness in the
fruition of souls [[soul]].

as to what concerns [[age]], which is alleged against me, ‘tis quite
contrary; ‘tis for [[youth]] to [[subject]] itself to [[common]] opinions [[opinion]], and to
curb itself to please others; it has wherewithal to please both the
people and itself; we have but too much ado to please ourselves alone.
as [[natural]] conveniences fail, let us supply them with those that are
artificial.  ‘tis [[injustice]] to excuse [[youth]] for pursuing its pleasures [[pleasure]],
and to forbid old [[men]] to seek them.  when [[young]], i concealed my wanton
passions with prudence; now i am old, i chase away melancholy by debauch.
and thus do the platonic laws [[law]] forbid [[men]] to travel till forty or fifty
years old, so that travel might be more useful and instructive in so
mature an [[age]].  i should sooner subscribe to the second article of the
same laws [[law]], which forbids it after threescore.

“but, at such an [[age]], you will never return from so long a [[journey]].”
 what [[care]] i for that?  i neither undertake it to return, nor to finish it
my [[business]] is only to keep myself in motion, whilst motion pleases me;
i only walk for the walk’s sake.  they who run after a benefit or a hare,
run not; they only run who run at base, and to exercise their running.
my design is divisible throughout: it is not grounded upon any great
hopes: every day concludes my expectation: and the [[journey]] of my [[life]] is
carried on after the same manner.  and yet i have seen places enough a
great way off, where i could have wished to have stayed.  and why not,
if chrysippus, cleanthes, diogenes, zeno, antipater, so many sages of the
sourest sect, readily abandoned their [[country]], without [[occasion]] of
complaint, and only for the enjoyment of another air.  in earnest, that
which most displeases me in all my travels is, that i cannot resolve to
settle my abode where i should [[best]] like, but that i must always propose
to myself to return, to accommodate myself to the [[common]] [[humour]].

if i feared to [[die]] in any other place than that of my birth; if i thought
i should [[die]] more uneasily remote from my own [[family]], i should hardly go
out of [[france]]; i should not, without [[fear]], step out of my parish; i feel
death always pinching me by the throat or by the back.  but i am
otherwise constituted; ‘tis in all places alike to me.  yet, might i have
my [[choice]], i [[think]] i should rather choose to [[die]] on horseback than in
bed; out of my own house, and far from my own [[people]].  there is more
heartbreaking than consolation in taking leave of one’s [[friends]]; i am
willing to omit that civility, for that, of all the offices of
friendship, is the only one that is unpleasant; and i could, with all my
heart, dispense with that [[great]] and eternal farewell.  if there be any
convenience in so many standers-by, it brings an hundred inconveniences
along with it.  i have seen many dying miserably surrounded with all this
train: ‘tis a crowd that chokes them.  ‘tis against [[duty]], and is a
testimony of little [[kindness]] and little [[care]], to permit you to [[die]] in
repose; one torments your [[eyes]], another your ears, another your tongue;
you have neither sense nor member that is not worried by them.  your
heart is wounded with compassion to hear the mourning of [[friends]], and,
perhaps with anger, to hear the counterfeit condolings of pretenders.
who ever has been delicate and sensitive, when well, is much more so when
ill.  in such a necessity, a gentle hand is required, accommodated to his
sentiment, to scratch him just in the place where he itches, otherwise
scratch him not at all.  if we stand in need of a [[wise]] woman--[midwife,
fr. ‘sage femme’.]--to bring us into the [[world]], we have much more need
of a still wiser [[man]] to [[help]] us out of it.  such a one, and a friend to
boot, a [[man]] ought to purchase at any cost for such an [[occasion]].  i am not
yet arrived to that pitch of disdainful vigour that is fortified in
itself, that nothing can assist or disturb; i am of a lower form; i
endeavour to hide myself, and to escape from this passage, not by [[fear]],
but by art [[arts]].  i do not intend in this act of dying to make proof and show
of my constancy. for whom should i do it? all the [[right]] and interest i
have in [[reputation]] will then cease.  i content myself with a death
involved within itself, quiet, solitary, and all my own, suitable to my
retired and private [[life]]; quite contrary to the roman superstition, where
a [[man]] was looked upon as unhappy who died without speaking, and who had
not his nearest relations to close his [[eyes]].  i have enough to do to
comfort myself, without having to console others; thoughts [[thought]] enough in my
head, not to need that circumstances should possess me with new; and
matter enough to occupy me without borrowing.  this affair is out of the
part of [[society]]; ‘tis the act of one [[single]] [[person]].  let us [[live]] and be
merry amongst our [[friends]]; let us go repine and [[die]] amongst strangers; a
man may find those, for his [[money]], who will shift his pillow and rub his
feet, and will trouble him no more than he would have them; who will
present to him an indifferent countenance, and suffer him to govern
himself, and to [[complain]] according to his own method.

i wean myself daily by my [[reason]] from this childish and inhuman [[humour]],
of desiring by our sufferings to move the compassion and mourning of our
friends: we stretch our own incommodities beyond their just extent when
we extract tears from others; and the constancy which we commend in every
one in supporting his adverse [[fortune]], we accuse and reproach in our
friends when the [[evil]] is our own; we are not satisfied that they should
be sensible of our condition only, unless they be, moreover, afflicted.
a [[man]] should diffuse joy, but, as much as he can, smother [[grief]].  he who
makes himself lamented without [[reason]] is a [[man]] not to be lamented when
there shall be real cause: to be always complaining is the way never to
be lamented; by making himself always in so pitiful a taking, he is never
commiserated by any.  he who makes himself out [[dead]] when he is alive, is
subject to be [[thought]] living when he is dying.  i have seen some who have
taken it ill when they have been told that they looked well, and that
their pulse was [[good]]; restrain their smiles, because they betrayed a
recovery, and be angry, at their health because it was not to be
lamented: and, which is a [[great]] deal more, these were not [[women]].
i describe my infirmities, such as they really are, at most, and avoid
all expressions of [[evil]] prognostic and composed exclamations.  if not
mirth, at least a temperate countenance in the standers-by, is proper in
the presence of a [[wise]] sick [[man]]: he does not quarrel with health, for,
seeing himself in a contrary condition, he is pleased to contemplate it
sound and entire in others, and at least to enjoy it for company: he does
not, for feeling himself melt away, abandon all living thoughts [[thought]], nor
avoid ordinary discourse.  i would study sickness whilst i am well; when
it has seized me, it will make its impression real enough, without the
help of my [[imagination]].  we prepare ourselves beforehand for the journeys
we undertake, and resolve upon them; we leave the appointment of the hour
when to take horse to the company, and in their favour defer it.

i find this unexpected advantage in the publication of my manners, that
it in some sort serves me for a [[rule]].  i have, at times [[time]], some
consideration of not betraying the [[history]] of my [[life]]: this public
declaration obliges me to keep my way, and not to give the [[lie]] to the
image i have drawn of my qualities, commonly less deformed and
contradictory than consists with the malignity and infirmity of the
judgments of this [[age]].  the uniformity and simplicity of my manners
produce a face of easy interpretation; but because the [[fashion]] is a
little new and not in use, it gives too [[great]] opportunity to slander.
yet so it is, that whoever would fairly assail me, i [[think]] i so
sufficiently assist his [[purpose]] in my known and avowed imperfections,
that he may that way satisfy his ill-nature without fighting with the
wind.  if i myself, to anticipate accusation and discovery, confess
enough to frustrate his malice, as he conceives, ‘tis but [[reason]] that he
make use of his [[right]] of amplification, and to wire-draw my vices [[vice]] as far
as he can; attack has its rights [[right]] beyond [[justice]]; and let him make the
roots of those errors i have laid open to him shoot up into trees: let
him make his use, not only of those i am really affected with, but also
of those that only threaten me; injurious vices [[vice]], both in quality and
number; let him cudgel me that way.  i should willingly [[follow]] the
example of the philosopher bion: antigonus being about to reproach him
with the meanness of his birth, he presently cut him short with this
declaration: “i am,” said he, “the [[son]] of a [[slave]], a butcher, and
branded, and of a strumpet my [[father]] [[married]] in the lowest of his
fortune; both of them were whipped for offences they had committed.  an
orator bought me, when a child, and finding me a pretty and hopeful boy,
bred me up, and when he died left me all his estate, which i have
transported into this [[city]] of [[athens]], and here settled myself to the
study of [[philosophy]].  let the historians never trouble themselves with
inquiring about me: i will tell them about it.”  a [[free]] and generous
confession enervates reproach and disarms slander.  so it is that, one
thing with another, i fancy [[men]] as often commend as undervalue me beyond
reason; as, methinks also, from my [[childhood]], in rank and [[degree]] of
honour, they have given me a place rather above than below my [[right]].
i should find myself more at ease in a [[country]] where these degrees [[degree]] were
either regulated or not regarded.  amongst [[men]], when an altercation about
the precedence either of walking or sitting exceeds three replies, ‘tis
reputed uncivil.  i never stick at giving or taking place out of [[rule]], to
avoid the trouble of such [[ceremony]]; and never any [[man]] had a [[mind]] to go
before me, but i permitted him to do it.

besides this [[profit]] i make of writing of myself, i have also hoped for
this other advantage, that if it should fall out that my [[humour]] should
please or jump with those of some honest [[man]] before i [[die]], he would then
desire and seek to be acquainted with me.  i have given him a [[great]] deal
of made-way; for all that he could have, in many years, acquired by close
familiarity, he has seen in three days in this memorial, and more surely
and exactly.  a pleasant fancy: many things that i would not confess to
any one in particular, i deliver to the [[public]], and send my [[best]] friends
to a bookseller’s shop, there to inform themselves concerning my most
secret thoughts [[thought]];

                    “excutienda damus praecordia.”

     [“we give our hearts [[heart]] to be examined.”--persius, v. 22.]

did i, by [[good]] direction, [[know]] where to seek any one proper for my
conversation, i should certainly go a [[great]] way to find him out: for the
sweetness of suitable and agreeable company cannot; in my [[opinion]], be
bought too dear.  o what a thing is a true friend!  how true is that old
saying, that the use of a friend is more pleasing and necessary than the
elements of water and fire!

to return to my [[subject]]: there is, then, no [[great]] harm in dying privately
and far from [[home]]; we conceive ourselves obliged to retire for natural
actions less unseemly and less terrible than this.  but, moreover, such
as are reduced to spin out a long languishing [[life]], ought not, perhaps,
to [[wish]] to trouble a [[great]] [[family]] with their continual miseries;
therefore the indians [[indian]], in a [[certain]] province, [[thought]] it just to knock a
man on the head when reduced to such a necessity; and in another of their
provinces, they all forsook him to shift for himself as well as he could.
to whom do they not, at [[last]], become tedious and insupportable? the
ordinary offices of fife do not go that length.  you [[teach]] your best
friends to be cruel perforce; hardening [[wife]] and [[children]] by long use
neither to regard nor to lament your sufferings.  the groans of the stone
are grown so familiar to my [[people]], that nobody takes any notice of them.
and though we should extract some [[pleasure]] from their conversation (which
does not always happen, by [[reason]] of the disparity of conditions, which
easily begets contempt or envy toward any one whatever), is it not too
much to make [[abuse]] of this half a lifetime?  the more i should see them
constrain themselves out of affection to be serviceable to me, the more i
should be [[sorry]] for their pains [[pain]].  we have [[liberty]] to lean, but not to lay
our whole weight upon others, so as to prop ourselves by their ruin; like
him who caused little children’s throats to be cut to make use of their
blood for the cure of a disease he had, or that other, who was
continually supplied with tender [[young]] girls to keep his old limbs warm
in the night, and to mix the sweetness of their breath with his, sour and
stinking.  i should readily advise venice as a retreat in this decline of
life.  decrepitude is a solitary quality.  i am sociable even to excess,
yet i [[think]] it reasonable that i should now withdraw my troubles from the
sight of the [[world]] and keep them to myself.  let me shrink and draw up
myself in my own shell, like a tortoise, and learn to see [[men]] without
hanging upon them.  i should endanger them in so slippery a passage: ‘tis
time to turn my back to company.

“but, in these travels, you will be taken ill in some wretched place,
where nothing can be had to relieve you.”  i always carry most things
necessary about me; and besides, we cannot evade [[fortune]] if she once
resolves to attack us.  i need nothing extraordinary when i am sick.
i will not be beholden to my bolus to do that for me which [[nature]] cannot.
at the very beginning of my fevers and sicknesses that cast me down,
whilst still entire, and but little, disordered in health, i reconcile
myself to almighty [[god]] by the [[last]] [[christian]], offices, and find myself by
so doing less [[oppressed]] and more easy, and have got, methinks, so much
the [[better]] of my disease.  and i have yet less need of a notary or
counsellor than of a physician.  what i have not settled of my affairs
when i was in health, let no one expect i should do it when i am sick.
what i will do for the service of [[death]] is always done; i durst not so
much as one day defer it; and if nothing be done, ‘tis as much as to say
either that [[doubt]] hindered my [[choice]] (and sometimes ‘tis well chosen not
to choose), or that i was positively resolved not to do anything at all.

i write my [[book]] for few [[men]] and for few years.  had it been matter of
duration, i should have put it into firmer [[language]].  according to the
continual variation that ours has been [[subject]] to, up to this day, who
can expect that its [[present]] form should be in use fifty years hence?
it slips every day through our fingers, and since i was born, it is
altered above one-half.  we say that it is now [[perfect]]; and every age
says the same of its own.  i shall hardly trust to that, so long as it
varies and changes [[change]] as it does.  ‘tis for [[good]] and useful writings to
rivet it to them, and its [[reputation]] will go according to the [[fortune]] of
our [[state]].  for which [[reason]] i am not afraid to insert in it several
private articles, which will spend their use amongst the [[men]] that are now
living, and that concern the particular [[knowledge]] of some who will see
further into them than every [[common]] reader.  i will not, after all, as i
often hear [[dead]] [[men]] spoken of, that [[men]] should say of me: “he judged, he
lived so and so; he would have done this or that; could he have spoken
when he was dying, he would have said so or so, and have given this thing
or t’other; i knew him [[better]] than any.”  now, as much as decency
permits, i here discover my inclinations and affections; but i do more
willingly and freely by word of mouth to any one who desires [[desire]] to be
informed.  so it is that in these memoirs, if any one observe, he will
find that i have either told or designed to tell all; what i cannot
express, i point out with my finger:

              “verum animo satis haec vestigia parva sagaci
               sunt, per quae possis cognoscere caetera tute”

     [“by these footsteps a sagacious [[mind]] many easily find all other
     matters (are sufficient to enable one to learn the rest well.)”
      --lucretius, i. 403.]

i leave nothing to be [[desired]] or to be guessed at concerning me.  if
people must be talking of me, i would have it to be justly and truly; i
would come again, with all my [[heart]], from the other [[world]] to give any one
the [[lie]] who should report me other than i was, though he did it to honour
me.  i perceive that [[people]] represent, even living [[men]], quite another
thing than what they really are; and had i not stoutly defended a friend
whom i have lost,--[de la boetie.]--they would have torn him into a
thousand contrary pieces.

to conclude the account of my [[poor]] humours [[humour]], i confess that in my travels
i seldom reach my inn but that it comes into my [[mind]] to consider whether
i could there be sick and dying at my ease.  i [[desire]] to be lodged in
some private part of the house, remote from all noise, ill scents, and
smoke.  i endeavour to flatter [[death]] by these frivolous circumstances;
or, to say [[better]], to discharge myself from all other incumbrances, that
i may have nothing to do, nor be troubled with anything but that which
will [[lie]] heavy enough upon me without any other load.  i would have my
death share in the ease and conveniences of my [[life]]; ‘tis a [[great]] part of
it, and of [[great]] importance, and i [[hope]] it will not in the future
contradict the [[past]].  [[death]] has some forms that are more easy than
others, and receives divers qualities, according to every one’s fancy.
amongst the [[natural]] deaths [[death]], that which proceeds from weakness and stupor
i [[think]] the most favourable; amongst those that are [[violent]], i can worse
endure to [[think]] of a precipice than of the fall of a house that will
crush me in a moment, and of a wound with a [[sword]] than of a harquebus
shot; i should rather have chosen to poison myself with [[socrates]], than
stab myself with cato.  and, though it, be all one, yet my imagination
makes as [[great]] a difference as betwixt [[death]] and [[life]], betwixt throwing
myself into a burning furnace and plunging into the channel of a river:
so idly does our [[fear]] more concern itself in the means than the effect.
it is but an instant, ‘tis true, but withal an instant of such weight,
that i would willingly give a [[great]] many days of my [[life]] to pass it over
after my own [[fashion]].  since every one’s [[imagination]] renders it more or
less terrible, and since every one has some [[choice]] amongst the several
forms of dying, let us try a little further to find some one that is
wholly clear from all offence.  might not one render it even voluptuous,
like the commoyientes of antony and cleopatra?  i set aside the brave and
exemplary efforts produced by [[philosophy]] and [[religion]]; but, amongst men
of little mark there have been found some, such as petronius and
tigellinus at [[rome]], condemned to despatch themselves, who have, as it
were, rocked [[death]] asleep with the delicacy of their preparations; they
have made it slip and steal away in the height of their accustomed
diversions amongst girls and [[good]] fellows; not a word of consolation, no
mention of making a will, no ambitious affectation of constancy, no talk
of their future condition; amongst sports [[sport]], feastings, wit, and mirth,
common and indifferent discourses, [[music]], and amorous verses.  were it
not possible for us to imitate this resolution after a more decent
manner?  since there are deaths [[death]] that are [[good]] for fools [[fool]], deaths [[death]] [[good]] for
the [[wise]], let us find out such as are fit for those who are betwixt both.
my [[imagination]] suggests to me one that is easy, and, since we must [[die]],
to be [[desired]].  the roman tyrants [[tyrant]] [[thought]] they did, in a manner, give a
criminal [[life]] when they gave him the [[choice]] of his [[death]].  but was not
theophrastus, that so delicate, so modest, and so [[wise]] a philosopher,
compelled by [[reason]], when he durst say this verse, translated by cicero:

               “vitam regit fortuna, non sapientia?”

               [“fortune, not [[wisdom]], sways [[human]] [[life]].”
                --cicero, tusc.  quaes., v. 31.]

fortune assists the facility of the bargain of my [[life]], having placed it
in such a condition that for the future it can be neither advantage nor
hindrance to those who are concerned in me; ‘tis a condition that i would
have accepted at any [[time]] of my [[life]]; but in this [[occasion]] of trussing up
my baggage, i am particularly pleased that in dying i shall neither do
them [[good]] nor harm.  she has so ordered it, by a cunning compensation,
that they who may pretend to any considerable advantage by my [[death]] will,
at the same [[time]], sustain a material inconvenience.  [[death]] sometimes is
more grievous to us, in that it is grievous to others, and interests us
in their interest as much as in our own, and sometimes more.

in this conveniency of lodging that i [[desire]], i mix nothing of pomp and
amplitude--i hate it rather; but a [[certain]] plain neatness, which is
oftenest found in places where there is less of art [[arts]], and that [[nature]] has
adorned with some grace that is all her own:

               “non ampliter, sea munditer convivium.”

     [“to [[eat]] not largely, but cleanly.”--nepos, [[life]] of atticus, c. 13]

                    “plus salis quam sumptus.”

     [“rather enough than costly (more wit than cost)”--nonius, xi. 19.]

and besides, ‘tis for those whose affairs compel them to travel in the
depth of winter through the grisons [[country]] to be surprised upon the way
with [[great]] inconveniences.  i, who, for the most part, travel for my
pleasure, do not order my affairs so ill.  if the way be foul on my right
hand, i turn on my left; if i find myself unfit to ride, i stay where i
am; and, so doing, in earnest i see nothing that is not as pleasant and
commodious as my own house.  ‘tis true that i always find superfluity
superfluous, and observe a [[kind]] of trouble even in abundance itself.
have i left anything behind me unseen, i go back to see it; ‘tis still on
my way; i trace no [[certain]] line, either straight or crooked.--[rousseau
has translated this passage in his emile, [[book]] v.]--do i not find in the
place to which i go what was reported to me--as it often falls out that
the judgments [[judgment]] of others do not jump with mine, and that i have found
their reports for the most part false--i never [[complain]] of losing my
labour: i have, at least, informed myself that what was told me was not
true.

i have a [[constitution]] of [[body]] as [[free]], and a palate as indifferent, as
any [[man]] living: the [[diversity]] of manners of several nations only affects
me in the [[pleasure]] of variety: every usage has its [[reason]].  let the plate
and dishes be pewter, wood, or [[earth]]; my meat be boiled or roasted; let
them give me butter or [[oil]], of nuts or olives, hot or cold, ‘tis all one
to me; and so indifferent, that growing old, i accuse this generous
faculty, and would [[wish]] that delicacy and [[choice]] should [[correct]] the
indiscretion of my appetite, and sometimes soothe my stomach.  when i
have been abroad out of [[france]] and that [[people]], out of courtesy, have
asked me if i would be served after the french manner, i laughed at the
question, and always frequented tables the most filled with foreigners.
i am ashamed to see our countrymen besotted with this foolish [[humour]] of
quarrelling with forms contrary to their own; they seem to be out of
their element when out of their own village: wherever they go, they keep
to their own fashions and abominate those of strangers.  do they meet
with a compatriot in hungary?  o the [[happy]] chance!  they are henceforward
inseparable; they cling together, and their whole discourse is to condemn
the barbarous manners they see about them.  why barbarous, because they
are not french?  and those have made the [[best]] use of their travels who
have observed most to speak against.  most of them go for no other end
but to come back again; they proceed in their travel with vast gravity
and circumspection, with a silent and incommunicable prudence, preserving
themselves from the contagion of an unknown air.  what i am saying of
them puts me in [[mind]] of something like it i have at times [[time]] observed in
some of our [[young]] courtiers; they will not mix with any but [[men]] of their
own sort, and look upon us as [[men]] of another [[world]], with disdain or [[pity]].
put them upon any discourse but the intrigues of the court, and they are
utterly at a loss; as very owls and novices to us as we are to them.
‘tis truly said that a well-bred [[man]] is a compound [[man]].  i, on the
contrary, travel very much sated with our own fashions; i do not look for
gascons in sicily; i have left enough of them at [[home]]; i rather seek for
greeks and persians; they are the [[men]] i endeavour to be acquainted with
and the [[men]] i study; ‘tis there that i bestow and employ myself.  and
which is more, i fancy that i have met but with few customs that are not
as [[good]] as our own; i have not, i confess, travelled very far; scarce out
of the sight of the vanes of my own house.

as to the rest, most of the accidental company a [[man]] falls into upon the
road beget him more trouble than [[pleasure]]; i waive them as much as i
civilly can, especially now that [[age]] seems in some sort to [[privilege]] and
sequester me from the [[common]] forms.  you suffer for others or others
suffer for you; both of them inconveniences of importance enough, but the
latter appears to me the greater.  ‘tis a rare [[fortune]], but of
inestimable solace; to have a worthy [[man]], one of a sound [[judgment]] and of
manners conformable to your own, who takes a delight to bear you company.
i have been at an infinite loss for such upon my travels.  but such a
companion should be chosen and acquired from your first setting out.
there can be no [[pleasure]] to me without communication: there is not so
much as a sprightly [[thought]] comes into my [[mind]], that it does not grieve
me to have produced alone, and that i have no one to communicate it to:

          “si cum hac exceptione detur sapientia,
          ut illam inclusam teneam, nec enuntiem, rejiciam.”

     [“if [[wisdom]] be conferred with this reservation, that i must keep it
     to myself, and not communicate it to others, i would none of it.”
      --seneca, ep., 6.]

this other has strained it one note higher:

     “si contigerit ea vita sapienti, ut ommum rerum afliuentibus copiis,
     quamvis omnia, quae cognitione digna sunt, summo otio secum ipse
     consideret et contempletur, tamen, si solitudo tanta sit, ut hominem
     videre non possit, excedat a vita.”

     [“if such a condition of [[life]] should happen to a [[wise]] [[man]], that in
     the [[greatest]] plenty of all conveniences he might, at the most
     undisturbed leisure, consider and contemplate all things worth the
     knowing, yet if his solitude be such that he must not see a [[man]], let
     him depart from [[life]].”--cicero, de offic., i. 43.]

architas pleases me when he says, “that it would be unpleasant, even in
heaven itself, to wander in those [[great]] and [[divine]] celestial bodies
without a companion.  but yet ‘tis much [[better]] to be alone than in
foolish and troublesome company.  aristippus loved to [[live]] as a stranger
in all places:

              “me si fata meis paterentur ducere vitam
               auspiciis,”

     [“if the fates [[fate]] would let me [[live]] in my own way.”--aeneid, iv. 340.]

i should choose to pass away the [[greatest]] part of my [[life]] on horseback:

                   “visere gestiens,
                    qua pane debacchentur ignes,
                    qua nebula, pluviique rores.”

     [“visit the regions where the sun burns, where are the thick
     rain-clouds and the frosts.”--horace, od., iii. 3, 54.]

“have you not more easy diversions at [[home]]?  what do you there want?  is
not your house situated in a sweet and healthful air, sufficiently
furnished, and more than sufficiently large?  has not the [[royal]] majesty
been more than once there entertained with all its train?  are there not
more below your [[family]] in [[good]] ease than there are above it in eminence?
is there any local, extraordinary, indigestible [[thought]] that afflicts
you?”

          “qua to nunc coquat, et vexet sub pectore fixa.”

     [“that may now worry you, and vex, fixed in your breast.”
      --cicero, de senect, c. 1, ex ennio.]

“where do you [[think]] to [[live]] without disturbance?”

                   “nunquam simpliciter fortuna indulget.”

               [“fortune is never simply complaisant (unmixed).”
                --quintus curtius, iv. 14]

you see, then, it is only you that trouble yourself; you will everywhere
follow yourself, and everywhere [[complain]]; for there is no satisfaction
here below, but either for brutish or for [[divine]] souls [[soul]].  he who, on so
just an [[occasion]], has no contentment, where will he [[think]] to find it?
how many thousands of [[men]] terminate their wishes [[wish]] in such a condition as
yours?  do but reform yourself; for that is wholly in your own power!
whereas you have no other [[right]] but patience towards [[fortune]]:

          “nulla placida quies est, nisi quam ratio composuit.”

     [“there is no tranquillity but that which [[reason]] has conferred.”
      --seneca, ep., 56.]

i see the [[reason]] of this [[advice]], and see it perfectly well; but he might
sooner have done, and more pertinently, in bidding me in one word be
wise; that resolution is beyond [[wisdom]]; ‘tis her precise [[work]] and
product.  thus the physician keeps preaching to a [[poor]] languishing
patient to “be cheerful”; but he would advise him a little more
discreetly in bidding him “be well.”  for my part, i am but a [[man]] of the
common sort.  ‘tis a wholesome precept, [[certain]] and easy to be
understood, “be content with what you have,” that is to say, with [[reason]]:
and yet to [[follow]] this [[advice]] is no more in the [[power]] of the [[wise]] [[men]] of
the [[world]] than in me.  ‘tis a [[common]] saying, but of a terrible extent:
what does it not comprehend?  all things fall under discretion and
qualification.  i [[know]] very well that, to take it by the letter, this
pleasure of travelling is a testimony of uneasiness and irresolution,
and, in sooth, these two are our governing and predominating qualities.
yes, i confess, i see nothing, not so much as in a [[dream]], in a [[wish]],
whereon i could set up my rest: variety only, and the possession of
diversity, can satisfy me; that is, if anything can.  in travelling, it
pleases me that i may stay where i like, without inconvenience, and that
i have a place wherein commodiously to divert myself.  i [[love]] a private
life, because ‘tis my own [[choice]] that i [[love]] it, not by any dissenting
from or dislike of [[public]] [[life]], which, peradventure, is as much according
to my [[complexion]].  i serve my [[prince]] more cheerfully because it is by the
free election of my own [[judgment]] and [[reason]], without any particular
obligation; and that i am not reduced and constrained so to do for being
rejected or disliked by the other party; and so of all the rest.  i hate
the morsels that necessity carves me; any commodity upon which i had only
to depend would have me by the throat;

          “alter remus aquas, alter mihi radat arenas;”

     [“let me have one oar in the water, and with the other rake the
     shore.”--propertius, iii. 3, 23.]

one cord will never hold me fast enough.  you will say, there is vanity
in this way of living.  but where is there not?  all these fine precepts
are vanity, and all [[wisdom]] is vanity:

     “dominus novit cogitationes sapientum, quoniam vanae sunt.”

     [“the [[lord]] knoweth the thoughts [[thought]] of the [[wise]], that they are [[vain]].”
      --ps. xciii. ii; or i cor. iii. 20.]

these exquisite subtleties are only fit for sermons; they are discourses
that will send us all saddled into the other [[world]].  [[life]] is a material
and corporal motion, an action imperfect and irregular of its own proper
essence; i make it my [[business]] to serve it according to itself:

                    “quisque suos patimur manes.”

     [“we each of us suffer our own particular demon.”--aeneid, vi. 743.]

     “sic est faciendum, ut contra naturam universam nihil contendamus;
     ea tamen conservata propriam sequamur.”

     [“we must so order it as by no means to contend against universal
     [[nature]]; but yet, that [[rule]] being observed, to [[follow]] our own.”
      --cicero, de offcc., i.  31.]

to what end are these elevated points of [[philosophy]], upon which no human
being can rely? and those rules [[rule]] that exceed both our use and [[force]]?

i see often that we have theories of [[life]] set before us which neither the
proposer nor those who hear him have any [[hope]], nor, which is more, any
inclination to [[follow]].  of the same sheet of paper whereon the [[judge]] has
but just written a sentence against an adulterer, he steals a piece
whereon to write a love-letter to his companion’s [[wife]].  she whom you
have but just now illicitly embraced will presently, even in your
hearing, more loudly inveigh against the same [[fault]] in her companion than
a portia would do;--[the chaste [[daughter]] of cato of utica.]--and men
there are who will condemn others to [[death]] for crimes that they
themselves do not repute so much as faults [[fault]].  i have, in my [[youth]], seen a
man of [[good]] rank with one hand [[present]] to the [[people]] verses that excelled
both in wit and debauchery, and with the other, at the same [[time]], the
most ripe and pugnacious theological reformation that the [[world]] has been
treated withal these many years.  and so [[men]] proceed; we let the laws [[law]] and
precepts [[follow]] their way; ourselves keep another course, not only from
debauchery of manners, but ofttimes by [[judgment]] and contrary [[opinion]].  do
but hear a philosophical lecture; the invention, eloquence, pertinency
immediately strike upon your [[mind]] and move you; there is nothing that
touches or stings your [[conscience]]; ‘tis not to this they address
themselves.  is not this true?  it made aristo say, that neither a bath
nor a lecture did aught unless it scoured and made [[men]] clean.  one may
stop at the skin; but it is after the marrow is picked out as, after we
have swallowed [[good]] wine out of a fine cup, we examine the designs and
workmanship.  in all the courts of ancient [[philosophy]], this is to be
found, that the same teacher publishes rules [[rule]] of temperance and at the
same [[time]] lessons in [[love]] and wantonness; xenophon, in the very bosom of
clinias, wrote against the aristippic [[virtue]].  ‘tis not that there is any
miraculous conversion in it that makes them thus wavering; ‘tis that
solon represents himself, sometimes in his own [[person]], and sometimes in
that of a legislator; one while he speaks for the crowd, and another for
himself; taking the [[free]] and [[natural]] rules [[rule]] for his own share, feeling
assured of a firm and entire health:

          “curentur dubii medicis majoribus aegri.”

          [“desperate maladies require the [[best]] doctors.”
           --juvenal, xiii. 124.]

antisthenes allows a sage to [[love]], and to do whatever he thinks
convenient, without regard to the laws [[law]], forasmuch as he is [[better]] advised
than they, and has a greater [[knowledge]] of [[virtue]].  his disciple diogenes
said, that “men to perturbations were to oppose [[reason]]: to [[fortune]],
courage: to the laws [[law]], [[nature]].”  for tender stomachs, constrained and
artificial recipes must be prescribed: [[good]] and [[strong]] stomachs serve
themselves simply with the prescriptions of their own [[natural]] appetite;
after this manner do our physicians proceed, who [[eat]] melons and drink
iced wines, whilst they confine their patients to syrups and sops.
“i [[know]] not,” said the courtezan lais, “what they may talk of books [[book]],
wisdom, and [[philosophy]]; but these [[men]] knock as often at my door as any
others.”  at the same rate that our licence carries us beyond what is
lawful and allowed, [[men]] have, often beyond universal [[reason]], stretched
the precepts and rules [[rule]] of our [[life]]:

          “nemo satis credit tantum delinquere, quantum
          permittas.”

     [“no one thinks [[think]] he has done ill to the full extent of what he may.”
      --juvenal, xiv. 233.]

it were to be wished that there was more proportion betwixt the command
and the [[obedience]]; and the mark seems to be [[unjust]] to which one cannot
attain.  there is no so [[good]] [[man]], who so squares all his thoughts [[thought]] and
actions to the laws [[law]], that he is not faulty enough to deserve hanging ten
times in his [[life]]; and he may well be such a one, as it were great
injustice and [[great]] harm to punish and ruin:

                              “ole, quid ad te
               de cute quid faciat ille vel ille sua?”

     [“olus, what is it to thee what he or she does with their skin?”
      --martial, vii. 9, i.]

and such an one there may be, who has no way offended the laws [[law]], who,
nevertheless, would not deserve the [[character]] of a [[virtuous]] [[man]], and whom
philosophy would justly condemn to be whipped; so unequal and perplexed
is this relation.  we are so far from being [[good]] [[men]], according to the
laws of [[god]], that we cannot be so according to our own [[human]] [[wisdom]] never
yet arrived at the duties [[duty]] it had itself prescribed; and could it arrive
there, it would still prescribe to itself others beyond, to which it
would ever aspire and pretend; so [[great]] an [[enemy]] to consistency is our
human condition.  [[man]] enjoins himself to be necessarily in [[fault]]: he is
not very discreet to cut out his own [[duty]] by the measure of another being
than his own.  to whom does he prescribe that which he does not expect
any one should perform? is he [[unjust]] in not doing what it is impossible
for him to do?  the laws [[law]] which condemn us not to be able, condemn us for
not being able.

at the worst, this difform [[liberty]] of presenting ourselves two several
ways, the actions after one manner and the reasoning after another, may
be allowed to those who only speak of things; but it cannot be allowed to
those who speak of themselves, as i do: i must march my pen as i do my
feet.  [[common]] [[life]] ought to have relation to the other lives [[life]]: the virtue
of cato was vigorous beyond the [[reason]] of the [[age]] he lived in; and for a
man who made it his [[business]] to govern others, a [[man]] dedicated to the
public service, it might be called a [[justice]], if not [[unjust]], at least
vain and out of season.  even my own manners, which differ not above an
inch from those current amongst us, render me, nevertheless, a little
rough and unsociable at my [[age]].  i [[know]] not whether it be without reason
that i am disgusted with the [[world]] i frequent; but i [[know]] very well that
it would be without [[reason]], should i [[complain]] of its being disgusted with
me, seeing i am so with it.  the [[virtue]] that is assigned to the affairs
of the [[world]] is a [[virtue]] of many wavings, corners, and elbows, to join
and adapt itself to [[human]] frailty, mixed and artificial, not straight,
clear, constant, nor purely [[innocent]].  our annals to this very day
reproach one of our kings [[king]] for suffering himself too simply to be carried
away by the conscientious persuasions of his confessor: affairs of state
have bolder precepts;

                                   “exeat aula,
                         qui vult esse pius.”

          [“let him who will be pious retire from the court.”
           --lucan, viii. 493]

i formerly tried to employ in the service of [[public]] affairs opinions [[opinion]] and
rules of living, as rough, new, unpolished or unpolluted, as they were
either born with me, or brought away from my [[education]], and wherewith i
serve my own turn, if not so commodiously, at least securely, in my own
particular concerns: a scholastic and novice [[virtue]]; but i have found
them unapt and dangerous.  he who goes into a crowd must now go one way
and then another, keep his elbows close, retire or advance, and quit the
straight way, according to what he encounters; and must [[live]] not so much
according to his own method as to that of others; not according to what
he proposes to himself, but according to what is proposed to him,
according to the [[time]], according to the [[men]], according to the occasions [[occasion]].
plato says, that whoever escapes from the world’s handling with clean
breeches, escapes by miracle: and says withal, that when he appoints his
philosopher the head of a [[government]], he does not mean a [[corrupt]] one like
that of [[athens]], and much less such a one as this of ours, wherein wisdom
itself would be to seek.  a [[good]] herb, transplanted into a soil contrary
to its own [[nature]], much sooner conforms itself to the soil than it
reforms the soil to it.  i found that if i had wholly to apply myself to
such employments, it would require a [[great]] deal of [[change]] and new
modelling in me before i could be any way fit for it: and though i could
so far prevail upon myself (and why might i not with [[time]] and diligence
work such a feat), i would not do it.  the little [[trial]] i have had of
public employment has been so much disgust to me; i [[feel]] at times
temptations toward [[ambition]] rising in my [[soul]], but i obstinately oppose
them:

               “at tu, catulle, obstinatus obdura.”

     [“but thou, catullus, be obstinately firm.”--catullus, viii. 19.]

i am seldom called to it, and as seldom offer myself uncalled; liberty
and laziness, the qualities most predominant in me, are qualities
diametrically contrary to that [[trade]].  we cannot well distinguish the
faculties of [[men]]; they have divisions and limits hard and delicate to
choose; to conclude from the discreet conduct of a private [[life]] a
capacity for the management of [[public]] affairs is to conclude ill; a man
may govern himself well who cannot govern others so, and compose essays
who could not [[work]] effects: [[men]] there may be who can order a siege well,
who would ill marshal a [[battle]]; who can speak well in private, who would
ill harangue a [[people]] or a [[prince]]; nay, ‘tis peradventure rather a
testimony in him who can do the one that he cannot do the other, than
otherwise.  i find that elevated souls [[soul]] are not much more proper for mean
things than mean souls [[soul]] are for high ones.  could it be imagined that
socrates should have administered [[occasion]] of laughter, at the expense of
his own [[reputation]], to the athenians for: having never been able to sum
up the votes of his tribe, to deliver it to the council?  truly, the
veneration i have for the perfections of this [[great]] [[man]] deserves that his
fortune should furnish, for the excuse of my principal imperfections, so
magnificent an [[example]].  our sufficiency is cut out into small parcels;
mine has no latitude, and is also very contemptible in number.
saturninus, to those who had conferred upon him the command in [[chief]]:
“companions,” said he, “you have lost a [[good]] captain, to make of him a
bad general.”

whoever boasts, in so sick a [[time]] as this, to employ a true and sincere
virtue in the world’s service, either knows [[know]] not what it is, opinions
growing [[corrupt]] with manners (and, in [[truth]], to hear them describe it, to
hear the most of them glorify themselves in their deportments, and lay
down their rules [[rule]]; instead of painting [[virtue]], they paint pure [[vice]] and
injustice, and so represent it false in the [[education]] of princes); or if
he does [[know]] it, boasts unjustly and let him say what he will, does a
thousand things of which his own [[conscience]] must necessarily accuse him.
i should willingly take seneca’s word on the [[experience]] he made upon the
like [[occasion]], provided he would deal sincerely with me.  the most
honourable mark of goodness in such a necessity is freely to confess both
one’s own faults [[fault]] and those of others; with the [[power]] of its [[virtue]] to
stay one’s inclination towards [[evil]]; unwillingly to [[follow]] this
propension; to [[hope]] [[better]], to [[desire]] [[better]].  i perceive that in these
divisions wherein we are involved in [[france]], every one labours [[labour]] to defend
his cause; but even the very [[best]] of them with dissimulation and
disguise: he who would write roundly of the true [[state]] of the quarrel,
would write rashly and wrongly.  the most just party is at [[best]] but a
member of a decayed and worm-eaten [[body]]; but of such a [[body]], the member
that is least affected calls itself sound, and with [[good]] [[reason]],
forasmuch as our qualities have no title but in comparison; civil
innocence is measured according to times [[time]] and places.  imagine this in
xenophon, related as a fine commendation of agesilaus: that, being
entreated by a neighbouring [[prince]] with whom he had formerly had [[war]], to
permit him to pass through his [[country]], he granted his request, giving
him [[free]] passage through peloponnesus; and not only did not imprison or
poison him, being at his [[mercy]], but courteously received him according to
the obligation of his promise, without doing him the least injury or
offence.  to such ideas [[idea]] as theirs this were an act of no especial note;
elsewhere and in another [[age]], the frankness and unanimity of such an
action would be [[thought]] wonderful; our monkeyish capets

     [capets, so called from their short capes, were the students of
     montaigne college at [[paris]], and were held in [[great]] contempt.]

would have laughed at it, so little does the spartan innocence resemble
that of [[france]].  we are not without [[virtuous]] [[men]], but ‘tis according to
our notions of [[virtue]].  whoever has his manners established in regularity
above the standard of the [[age]] he lives [[life]] in, let him either wrest or blunt
his rules [[rule]], or, which i would rather advise him to, let him retire, and
not meddle with us at all.  what will he get by it?

              “egregium sanctumque virum si cerno, bimembri
               hoc monstrum puero, et miranti jam sub aratro
               piscibus inventis, et foetae comparo mulae.”

     [“if i see an exemplary and [[good]] [[man]], i liken it to a two-headed
     boy, or a fish turned up by the plough, or a teeming mule.”
      --juvenal, xiii. 64.]

one may regret [[better]] times [[time]], but cannot fly from the [[present]]; we may wish
for other magistrates, but we must, notwithstanding, obey those we have;
and, peradventure, ‘tis more laudable to obey the [[bad]] than the [[good]].  so
long as the image of the ancient and received laws [[law]] of this [[monarchy]] shall
shine in any corner of the [[kingdom]], there will i be.  if they
unfortunately happen to thwart and contradict one another, so as to
produce two parts, of doubtful and difficult [[choice]], i will willingly
choose to withdraw and escape the tempest; in the meantime [[nature]] or the
hazards of [[war]] may lend me a helping hand.  betwixt caesar and pompey,
i should frankly have declared myself; but, as amongst the three robbers
who came after,--[octavius, mark antony, and lepidus.]--a [[man]] must have
been necessitated either to hide himself, or have gone along with the
current of the [[time]], which i [[think]] one may fairly do when [[reason]] no
longer guides:

                         “quo diversus abis?”

          [“whither dost thou run wandering?”--aeneid, v. 166.]

this medley is a little from my theme; i go out of my way; but ‘tis
rather by licence than oversight; my fancies [[follow]] one another, but
sometimes at a [[great]] distance, and look towards one another, but ‘tis
with an oblique glance.  i have [[read]] a dialogue of [[plato]],--[the
phaedrus.]--of the like motley and fantastic composition, the beginning
about [[love]], and all the rest to the end about rhetoric; they [[fear]] not
these variations, and have a marvellous grace in letting themselves be
carried away at the [[pleasure]] of the wind, or at least to seem as if they
were.  the titles of my chapters [[chapter]] do not always comprehend the whole
matter; they often denote it by some mark only, as these others, andria,
eunuchus; or these, sylla, cicero, toyquatus.  i [[love]] a poetic [[progress]],
by leaps and skips; ‘tis an art [[arts]], as [[plato]] says, [[light]], nimble, demoniac.
there are pieces in plutarch where he forgets his theme; where the
proposition of his argument is only found by incidence, stuffed and half
stifled in [[foreign]] matter.  observe his footsteps in the daemon of
socrates.  o god!  how beautiful are these frolicsome sallies, those
variations and digressions, and all the more when they seem most
fortuitous and careless.  ‘tis the indiligent reader who loses my
subject, and not i; there will always be found some word or other in a
corner that is to the [[purpose]], though it [[lie]] very close.  i ramble
indiscreetly and tumultuously; my style and my wit wander at the same
rate.  he must [[fool]] it a little who would not be deemed wholly a [[fool]],
say both the precepts, and, still more, the examples [[example]] of our masters.  a
thousand poets flag and languish after a prosaic manner; but the [[best]] old
prose (and i strew it here up and down indifferently for verse) shines
throughout with the lustre, vigour, and boldness of poetry, and not
without some air of its fury.  and certainly prose ought to have the
pre-eminence in speaking.  the poet, says [[plato]], seated upon the muses
tripod, pours out with fury whatever comes into his mouth, like the pipe
of a fountain, without considering and weighing it; and things escape him
of various colours, of contrary substance, and with an irregular torrent.
plato himself is throughout poetical; and the old theology, as the
learned tell us, is all poetry; and the first [[philosophy]] is the original
language of the gods.  i would have my matter distinguish itself; it
sufficiently shows where it changes [[change]], where it concludes, where it begins,
and where it rejoins, without interlacing it with words of connection
introduced for the relief of [[weak]] or negligent ears, and without
explaining myself.  who is he that had not rather not be [[read]] at all than
after a drowsy or cursory manner?

             “nihil est tam utile, quod intransitu prosit.”

          [“nothing is so useful as that which is cursorily so.”
           --seneca, ep., 2.]

if to take books [[book]] in hand were to learn them: to look upon them were to
consider them: and to run these slightly over were to grasp them, i were
then to blame to make myself out so ignorant as i say i am.  seeing i
cannot fix the attention of my reader by the weight of what i write,
‘manco male’, if i should [[chance]] to do it by my intricacies.  “nay, but
he will afterwards repent that he ever perplexed himself about it.”
 ‘tis very true, but he will yet be there perplexed.  and, besides, there
are some humours [[humour]] in which comprehension produces [[produce]] disdain; who will think
better of me for not understanding what i say, and will conclude the
depth of my sense by its obscurity; which, to speak in [[good]] sooth, i
mortally hate, and would avoid it if i could.  [[aristotle]] boasts somewhere
in his writings that he affected it: a vicious affectation.  the frequent
breaks into chapters [[chapter]] that i made my method in the beginning of my [[book]],
having since seemed to me to dissolve the attention before it was raised,
as making it disdain to settle itself to so little, i, upon that account,
have made them longer, such as require proposition and assigned leisure.
in such an employment, to whom you will not give an hour you give
nothing; and you do nothing for him for whom you only do it whilst you
are doing something else.  to which may be added that i have,
peradventure, some particular obligation to speak only by halves, to
speak confusedly and discordantly.  i am therefore angry at this
trouble-feast [[reason]], and its extravagant projects that worry one’s [[life]],
and its opinions [[opinion]], so fine and subtle, though they be all true, i think
too dear bought and too inconvenient.  on the contrary, i make it my
business to bring vanity itself in repute, and folly too, if it produce
me any [[pleasure]]; and let myself [[follow]] my own [[natural]] inclinations,
without carrying too strict a hand upon them.

i have seen elsewhere houses in ruins, and statues both of gods and [[men]]:
these are [[men]] still.  ‘tis all true; and yet, for all that, i cannot so
often revisit the tomb of that so [[great]] and so puissant [[city]],--[rome]--
that i do not [[admire]] and reverence it.  the [[care]] of the [[dead]] is
recommended to us; now, i have been bred up from my infancy with these
dead; i had [[knowledge]] of the affairs of [[rome]] long before i had any of
those of my own house; i knew the capitol and its plan before i knew the
louvre, and the tiber before i knew the seine.  the qualities and
fortunes of lucullus, metellus, and scipio have ever run more in my head
than those of any of my own [[country]]; they are all [[dead]]; so is my father
as absolutely [[dead]] as they, and is removed as far from me and [[life]] in
eighteen years as they are in sixteen hundred: whose memory,
nevertheless, [[friendship]] and [[society]], i do not cease to embrace and
utilise with a [[perfect]] and lively union.  nay, of my own inclination, i
pay more service to the [[dead]]; they can no longer [[help]] themselves, and
therefore, methinks, the more require my assistance: ‘tis there that
gratitude appears in its full lustre.  the benefit is not so generously
bestowed, where there is retrogradation and reflection.  arcesilaus,
going to visit ctesibius, who was sick, and finding him in a very poor
condition, very finely conveyed some [[money]] under his pillow, and, by
concealing it from him, acquitted him, moreover, from the acknowledgment
due to such a benefit.  such as have merited from me [[friendship]] and
gratitude have never lost these by being no more; i have [[better]] and more
carefully paid them when gone and ignorant of what i did; i speak most
affectionately of my [[friends]] when they can no longer [[know]] it.  i have had
a hundred quarrels in defending pompey and for the cause of brutus; this
acquaintance yet continues betwixt us; we have no other hold even on
present things but by fancy.  finding myself of no use to this [[age]], i
throw myself back upon that other, and am so enamoured of it, that the
free, just, and flourishing [[state]] of that ancient [[rome]] (for i neither
love it in its birth nor its old age) interests and impassionates me;
and therefore i cannot so often revisit the sites of their streets and
houses, and those ruins profound even to the antipodes, that i am not
interested in them.  is it by [[nature]], or through error of fancy, that the
sight of places which we [[know]] to have been frequented and inhabited by
persons whose memories are recommended in story, moves us in some sort
more than to hear a recital of their--acts or to [[read]] their writings?

     “tanta vis admonitionis inest in locis....et id quidem in hac urbe
     infinitum; quacumque enim ingredimur, in aliquam historiam vestigium
     ponimus.”

     [“so [[great]] a [[power]] of reminiscence resides in places; and that truly
     in this [[city]] infinite, for which way soever we go, we find the
     traces of some story.”--cicero, de fin., v. i, 2.]

it pleases me to consider their face, bearing, and vestments: i pronounce
those [[great]] names betwixt my teeth, and make them ring in my ears:

     “ego illos veneror, et tantis nominibus semper assurgo.”

     [“i reverence them, and always rise to so [[great]] names.”
      --seneca, ep., 64.]

of things that are in some part [[great]] and admirable, i [[admire]] even the
common parts: i could [[wish]] to see them in familiar relations, walk, and
sup.  it were ingratitude to contemn the relics and images of so many
worthy and valiant [[men]] as i have seen [[live]] and [[die]], and who, by their
example, give us so many [[good]] instructions, knew we how to [[follow]] them.

and, moreover, this very [[rome]] that we now see, deserves to be beloved, so
long and by so many titles allied to our [[crown]]; the only [[common]] and
universal [[city]]; the [[sovereign]] magistrate that commands there is equally
acknowledged elsewhere ‘tis the metropolitan [[city]] of all the christian
nations the spaniard and frenchman is there at [[home]]: to be a [[prince]] of
that [[state]], there needs no more but to be of christendom wheresoever.
there is no place upon [[earth]] that [[heaven]] has embraced with such an
influence and constancy of favour; her very ruins are grand and glorious,

                “laudandis pretiosior ruinis.”

          [“more precious from her glorious ruins.”
           --sidonius apollinaris, carm., xxiii.; narba, v. 62.]

she yet in her very tomb retains the marks and images of [[empire]]:

          “ut palam sit, uno in loco gaudentis opus esse naturx.”

     [“that it may be manifest that there is in one place the [[work]] of
     rejoicing [[nature]].”--pliny, nat. hist., iii. 5.]

some would blame and be angry at themselves to perceive themselves
tickled with so [[vain]] a [[pleasure]] our humours [[humour]] are never too [[vain]] that are
pleasant let them be what they may, if they constantly content a [[man]] of
common understanding, i could not have the [[heart]] to blame him.

i am very much obliged to [[fortune]], in that, to this very hour, she has
offered me no outrage beyond what i was well able to bear.  is it not her
custom to let those [[live]] in quiet by whom she is not importuned?

                   “quanto quisque sibi plum negaverit,
                    a diis plum feret: nil cupientium
                    nudus castra peto .  .  .  .
                    multa petentibus
                    desunt multa.”

     [“the more each [[man]] denies himself, the more the gods give him.
     [[poor]] as i am, i seek the company of those who ask nothing; they who
     [[desire]] much will be deficient in much.”
      --horace, od., iii. 16,21,42.]

if she continue her favour, she will dismiss me very well satisfied:

                                   “nihil supra
                         deos lacesso.”

     [“i trouble the gods no farther.”--horace, od., ii. 18, 11.]

but beware a shock: there are a thousand who perish in the port.
i easily comfort myself for what shall here happen when i shall be gone,
present things trouble me enough:

                       “fortunae caetera mando.”

          [“i leave the rest to [[fortune]].”--ovid, metam., ii. 140.]

besides, i have not that [[strong]] obligation that they say ties [[men]] to the
future, by the issue that succeeds to their name and [[honour]]; and
peradventure, ought less to covet them, if they are to be so much
desired.  i am but too much tied to the [[world]], and to this [[life]], of
myself: i am content to be in fortune’s [[power]] by circumstances properly
necessary to my being, without otherwise enlarging her jurisdiction over
me; and have never [[thought]] that to be without [[children]] was a defect that
ought to render [[life]] less complete or less contented: a sterile vocation
has its conveniences too.  [[children]] are of the number of things that are
not so much to be [[desired]], especially now that it would be so hard to
make them [[good]]:

      “bona jam nec nasci licet, ita corrupta bunt semina;”

     [“nothing [[good]] can be born now, the seed is so [[corrupt]].”
      --tertullian, de pudicita.]

and yet they are justly to be lamented by such as lose them when they
have them.

he who left me my house in charge, foretold that i was like to ruin it,
considering my [[humour]] so little inclined to look after household affairs.
but he was mistaken; for i am in the same condition now as when i first
entered into it, or rather somewhat [[better]]; and yet without office or any
place of [[profit]].

as to the rest, if [[fortune]] has never done me any [[violent]] or extraordinary
injury, neither has she done me any particular favour; whatever we derive
from her bounty, was there above a hundred years before my [[time]]: i have,
as to my own particular, no essential and solid [[good]], that i stand
indebted for to her liberality.  she has, indeed, done me some airy
favours, honorary and titular favours, without substance, and those in
truth she has not granted, but offered me, who, [[god]] knows [[know]], am all
material, and who take nothing but what is real, and indeed massive too,
for current [[pay]]: and who, if i durst confess so much, should not think
avarice much less excusable than [[ambition]]: nor [[pain]] less to be avoided
than shame; nor health less to be coveted than learning, or riches [[rich]] than
nobility.

amongst those empty favours of hers, there is none that so much pleases
vain [[humour]] [[natural]] to my [[country]], as an authentic bull of a roman
burgess-ship, that was granted me when i was [[last]] there, glorious in
seals and gilded letters, and granted with all gracious liberality.  and
because ‘tis couched in a mixt style, more or less favourable, and that i
could have been glad to have seen a copy of it before it had passed the
seal.

being before burgess of no [[city]] at all, i am glad to be created one of
the most [[noble]] that ever was or ever shall be.  if other [[men]] would
consider themselves at the rate i do, they would, as i do, discover
themselves to be full of inanity and foppery; to rid myself of it, i
cannot, without making myself away.  we are all steeped in it, as well
one as another; but they who are not aware on’t, have somewhat the better
bargain; and yet i [[know]] not whether they have or no.

this [[opinion]] and [[common]] usage to observe others more than ourselves has
very much relieved us that way: ‘tis a very displeasing object: we can
there see nothing but misery and vanity: [[nature]], that we may not be
dejected with the sight of our own deformities, has wisely thrust the
action of seeing outward.  we go forward with the current, but to turn
back towards ourselves is a painful motion; so is the sea moved and
troubled when the waves rush against one another.  observe, says every
one, the motions of the heavens [[heaven]], of [[public]] affairs; observe the quarrel
of such a [[person]], take notice of such a one’s pulse, of such another’s
last will and testament; in sum, be always looking high or low, on one
side, before or behind you.  it was a paradoxical command anciently given
us by that [[god]] of delphos: “look into yourself; discover yourself; keep
close to yourself; call back your [[mind]] and will, that elsewhere consume
themselves into yourself; you run out, you spill yourself; carry a more
steady hand: [[men]] betray you, [[men]] spill you, [[men]] steal you from yourself.
dost thou not see that this [[world]] we [[live]] in keeps all its sight confined
within, and its [[eyes]] open to contemplate itself?  ‘tis always vanity for
thee, both within and without; but ‘tis less vanity when less extended.
excepting thee, o [[man]], said that [[god]], everything studies itself first,
and has bounds to its labours [[labour]] and desires [[desire]], according to its need.  there
is nothing so empty and necessitous as thou, who embracest the [[universe]];
thou art [[arts]] the investigator without [[knowledge]], the magistrate without
jurisdiction, and, after all, the [[fool]] of the farce.”

chapter x

of managing the will

few things, in comparison of what commonly affect other [[men]], move, or, to
say [[better]], possess me: for ‘tis but [[reason]] they should concern a [[man]],
provided they do not possess him.  i am very solicitous, both by study
and argument, to enlarge this [[privilege]] of insensibility, which is in me
naturally raised to a pretty [[degree]], so that consequently i espouse and
am very much moved with very few things.  i have a clear sight enough,
but i fix it upon very few objects; i have a sense delicate and tender
enough; but an apprehension and application hard and negligent.  i am
very unwilling to engage myself; as much as in me lies [[lie]], i employ myself
wholly on myself, and even in that [[subject]] should rather choose to curb
and restrain my affection from plunging itself over head and ears into
it, it being a [[subject]] that i possess at the [[mercy]] of others, and over
which [[fortune]] has more [[right]] than i; so that even as to health, which i
so much value, ‘tis all the more necessary for me not so passionately to
covet and heed it, than to find diseases so insupportable.  a [[man]] ought
to moderate himself betwixt the [[hatred]] of [[pain]] and the [[love]] of [[pleasure]]:
and [[plato]] sets down a middle path of [[life]] betwixt the two.  but against
such affections as wholly carry me away from myself and fix me elsewhere,
against those, i say, i oppose myself with my utmost [[power]].  ‘tis my
opinion that a [[man]] should lend himself to others, and only give himself
to himself.  were my will easy to lend itself out and to be swayed, i
should not stick there; i am too tender both by [[nature]] and use:

            “fugax rerum, securaque in otia natus.”

          [“avoiding affairs and born to secure ease.”
           --ovid, de trist., iii. 2, 9.]

hot and obstinate disputes, wherein my adversary would at [[last]] have the
better, the issue that would render my heat and obstinacy disgraceful
would peradventure vex me to the [[last]] [[degree]].  should i set myself to it
at the rate that others do, my [[soul]] would never have the [[force]] to bear
the emotion and alarms of those who grasp at so much; it would
immediately be disordered by this inward agitation.  if, sometimes, i
have been put upon the management of other [[men’s]] affairs, i have promised
to take them in hand, but not into my lungs and liver; to take them upon
me, not to incorporate them; to take pains [[pain]], yes: to be impassioned about
it, by no means; i have a [[care]] of them, but i will not sit upon them.
i have enough to do to order and govern the domestic throng of those that
i have in my own veins and bowels, without introducing a crowd of other
men’s affairs; and am sufficiently concerned about my own proper and
natural [[business]], without meddling with the concerns of others.  such as
know how much they owe to themselves, and how many offices they are bound
to of their own, find that [[nature]] has cut them out [[work]] enough of their
own to keep them from being idle.  “thou hast [[business]] enough at [[home]]:
look to that.”

men let themselves out to hire; their faculties are not for themselves,
but for those to whom they have enslaved themselves; ‘tis their tenants
occupy them, not themselves.  this [[common]] [[humour]] pleases not me.  we must
be thrifty of the [[liberty]] of our souls [[soul]], and never let it out but upon
just occasions [[occasion]], which are very few, if we [[judge]] aright.  do but observe
such as have accustomed themselves to be at every one’s call: they do it
indifferently upon all, as well little as [[great]], occasions [[occasion]]; in that which
nothing concerns them; as much as in what imports them most.  they thrust
themselves in indifferently wherever there is [[work]] to do and obligation,
and are without [[life]] when not in tumultuous bustle:

                    “in negotiis sunt, negotii cause,”

     [“they are in [[business]] for business’ sake.”--seneca, ep., 22.]

it is not so much that they will go, as it is that they cannot stand
still: like a rolling stone that cannot stop till it can go no further.
occupation, with a [[certain]] sort of [[men]], is a mark of understanding and
dignity: their souls [[soul]] seek repose in agitation, as [[children]] do by being
rocked in a cradle; they may pronounce themselves as serviceable to their
friends, as they are troublesome to themselves.  no one distributes his
money to others, but every one distributes his [[time]] and his [[life]]: there
is nothing of which we are so prodigal as of these two things, of which
to be thrifty would be both commendable and useful.  i am of a quite
contrary [[humour]]; i look to myself, and commonly covet with no great
ardour what i do [[desire]], and [[desire]] little; and i employ and busy myself
at the same rate, rarely and temperately.  whatever they take in hand,
they do it with their utmost will and vehemence.  there are so many
dangerous steps, that, for the more safety, we must a little lightly and
superficially glide over the [[world]], and not rush through it.  pleasure
itself is painful in profundity:

                              “incedis per ignes,
                    suppositos cineri doloso.”

          [“you tread on [[fire]], hidden under deceitful ashes.”
           --horace, od., ii. i, 7.]

the [[parliament]] of bordeaux chose me mayor of their [[city]] at a [[time]] when i
was at a distance from [[france]],--[at bagno della villa, near lucca,
september 1581]--and still more remote from any such [[thought]].
i entreated to be excused, but i was told by my [[friends]] that i had
committed an error in so doing, and the greater because the [[king]] had,
moreover, interposed his command in that affair.  ‘tis an office that
ought to be looked upon so much more honourable, as it has no other
salary nor advantage than the bare [[honour]] of its execution.  it continues
two years, but may be extended by a second election, which very rarely
happens; it was to me, and had never been so but twice before: some years
ago to monsieur de lansac, and lately to monsieur de biron, marshal of
france, in whose place i succeeded; and, i left mine to monsieur de
matignon, marshal of [[france]] also: proud of so [[noble]] a fraternity--

               “uterque bonus pacis bellique minister.”

          [“either one a [[good]] minister in [[peace]] and [[war]].”
           --aeneid, xi. 658.]

fortune would have a hand in my promotion, by this particular
circumstance which she put in of her own, not altogether [[vain]]; for
alexander disdained the ambassadors of corinth, who came to offer him a
burgess-ship of their [[city]]; but when they proceeded to lay before him
that bacchus and hercules were also in the register, he graciously
thanked them.

at my arrival, i faithfully and conscientiously represented myself to
them for such as i find myself to be--a [[man]] without memory, without
vigilance, without [[experience]], and without vigour; but withal, without
hatred, without [[ambition]], without avarice, and without [[violence]]; that
they might be informed of my qualities, and [[know]] what they were to expect
from my service.  and whereas the [[knowledge]] they had had of my late
father, and the [[honour]] they had for his memory, had alone incited them to
confer this favour upon me, i plainly told them that i should be very
sorry anything should make so [[great]] an impression upon me as their
affairs and the concerns of their [[city]] had made upon him, whilst he held
the [[government]] to which they had preferred me.  i remembered, when a boy,
to have seen him in his old [[age]] cruelly tormented with these public
affairs, neglecting the soft repose of his own house, to which the
declension of his [[age]] had reduced him for several years before, the
management of his own affairs, and his health; and certainly despising
his own [[life]], which was in [[great]] danger of being lost, by being engaged
in long and painful journeys on their behalf.  such was he; and this
humour of his proceeded from a marvellous [[good]] [[nature]]; never was there a
more charitable and popular [[soul]].  yet this proceeding which i commend in
others, i do not [[love]] to [[follow]] myself, and am not without excuse.

he had learned that a [[man]] must forget himself for his neighbour, and that
the particular was of no manner of consideration in comparison with the
general.  most of the rules [[rule]] and precepts of the [[world]] run this way; to
drive us out of ourselves into the street for the benefit of public
society; they [[thought]] to do a [[great]] feat to divert and remove us from
ourselves, assuming we were but too much fixed there, and by a too
natural inclination; and have said all they could to that [[purpose]]: for
‘tis no new thing for the sages to preach things as they serve, not as
they are.  [[truth]] has its obstructions, inconveniences, and
incompatibilities with us; we must often [[deceive]] that we may not deceive
ourselves; and shut our [[eyes]] and our understandings to redress and amend
them:

          “imperiti enim judicant, et qui frequenter
          in hoc ipsum fallendi sunt, ne errent.”

     [“for the ignorant [[judge]], and therefore are oft to be deceived,
     less they should err.”--quintil., inst. orat., xi. 17.]

when they order us to [[love]] three, four, or fifty degrees [[degree]] of things above
ourselves,  they do like archers, who, to hit the [[white]], take their aim a
great deal higher than the butt; to make a crooked stick straight, we
bend it the contrary way.

i [[believe]] that in the temple of pallas, as we see in all other religions [[religion]],
there were apparent mysteries to be exposed to the [[people]]; and others,
more secret and high, that were only to be shown to such as were
professed; ‘tis likely that in these the true point of [[friendship]] that
every one owes to himself is to be found; not a false [[friendship]], that
makes us embrace [[glory]], [[knowledge]], riches [[rich]], and the like, with a principal
and immoderate affection, as members of our being; nor an indiscreet and
effeminate [[friendship]], wherein it happens, as with ivy, that it decays
and ruins the walls it embraces; but a sound and regular [[friendship]],
equally useful and pleasant.  he who knows [[know]] the duties [[duty]] of this friendship
and practises them is truly of the cabinet of the muses, and has attained
to the height of [[human]] [[wisdom]] and of our [[happiness]], such an one, exactly
knowing what he owes to himself, will on his part find that he ought to
apply to himself the use of the [[world]] and of other [[men]]; and to do this,
to contribute to [[public]] [[society]] the duties [[duty]] and offices appertaining to
him.  he who does not in some sort [[live]] for others, does not [[live]] much
for himself:

     “qui sibi amicus est, scito hunc amicum omnibus esse.”

     [“he who is his own friend, is a friend to everybody else.”
      --seneca, ep., 6.]

the principal charge we have is, to every one his own conduct; and ‘tis
for this only that we here are.  as he who should forget to [[live]] a
virtuous and holy [[life]], and should [[think]] he acquitted himself of his duty
in instructing and training others up to it, would be a [[fool]]; even so he
who abandons his own particular healthful and pleasant living to serve
others therewith, takes, in my [[opinion]], a [[wrong]] and unnatural course.

i would not that [[men]] should refuse, in the employments they take upon
them, their attention, pains [[pain]], eloquence, sweat, and [[blood]] if need be:

                         “non ipse pro caris amicis
                    aut patria, timidus perire:”

     [“himself not afraid to [[die]] for beloved [[friends]], or for his
     [[country]].”--horace, od., iv. 9, 51.]

but ‘tis only borrowed, and accidentally; his [[mind]] being always in repose
and in health; not without action, but without vexation, without passion.
to be simply acting costs him so little, that he acts even sleeping;
but it must be set on going with discretion; for the [[body]] receives the
offices imposed upon it just according to what they are; the [[mind]] often
extends and makes them heavier at its own expense, giving them what
measure it pleases.  [[men]] perform like things with several sorts of
endeavour, and different contention of will; the one does well enough
without the other; for how many [[people]] hazard themselves every day in war
without any concern which way it goes; and thrust themselves into the
dangers of battles [[battle]], the loss of which will not break their next night’s
sleep? and such a [[man]] may be at [[home]], out of the danger which he durst
not have looked upon, who is more passionately concerned for the issue of
this [[war]], and whose [[soul]] is more anxious about events than the soldier
who therein stakes his [[blood]] and his [[life]].  i could have engaged myself
in [[public]] employments without quitting my own matters a nail’s breadth,
and have given myself to others without abandoning myself.  this
sharpness and [[violence]] of desires [[desire]] more hinder than they advance the
execution of what we undertake; fill us with [[impatience]] against slow or
contrary events, and with heat and suspicion against those with whom we
have to do.  we never carry on that thing well by which we are
prepossessed and [[led]]:

                         “male cuncta ministrat
                         impetus.”

     [“impulse manages all things ill.”--statius, thebaid, x. 704.]

he who therein employs only his [[judgment]] and address proceeds more
cheerfully: he counterfeits, he gives way, he defers quite at his ease,
according to the necessities of occasions [[occasion]]; he fails in his attempt
without trouble and affliction, ready and entire for a new enterprise;
he always marches with the bridle in his hand.  in him who is intoxicated
with this [[violent]] and [[tyrannical]] intention, we discover, of necessity,
much imprudence and [[injustice]]; the impetuosity of his [[desire]] carries him
away; these are rash motions, and, if [[fortune]] do not very much assist,
of very little fruit.  [[philosophy]] directs that, in the [[revenge]] of
injuries received, we should strip ourselves of choler; not that the
chastisement should be less, but, on the contrary, that the [[revenge]] may
be the [[better]] and more heavily laid on, which, it conceives, will be by
this impetuosity hindered.  for anger not only disturbs, but, of itself,
also wearies the arms of those who chastise; this [[fire]] benumbs and wastes
their [[force]]; as in precipitation, “festinatio tarda est,”--haste trips
up its own heels, fetters, and stops itself:

               “ipsa se velocitas implicat.”--seneca, ep. 44

for [[example]], according to what i commonly see, avarice has no greater
impediment than itself; the more bent and vigorous it is, the less it
rakes together, and commonly sooner grows [[rich]] when disguised in a visor
of liberality.

a very excellent gentleman, and a friend of mine, ran a risk of impairing
his faculties by a too passionate attention and affection to the affairs
of a [[certain]] [[prince]] his master;--[probably the [[king]] of navarre, afterward
henry iv.]--which master has thus portrayed himself to me; “that he
foresees the weight of accidents as well as another, but that in those
for which there is no remedy, he presently resolves upon suffering; in
others, having taken all the necessary precautions which by the vivacity
of his understanding he can presently do, he quietly awaits what may
follow.”  and, in [[truth]], i have accordingly seen him maintain a great
indifferency and [[liberty]] of actions and serenity of countenance in very
great and difficult affairs: i find him much greater, and of greater
capacity in adverse than in prosperous [[fortune]]; his defeats are to him
more glorious than his victories [[victory]], and his mourning than his triumph.

consider, that even in [[vain]] and frivolous actions, as at chess, tennis,
and the like, this eager and ardent engaging with an impetuous [[desire]],
immediately throws the [[mind]] and members into indiscretion and disorder: a
man astounds and hinders himself; he who carries himself more moderately,
both towards gain and loss, has always his wits about him; the less
peevish and passionate he is at play, he plays much more advantageously
and surely.

as to the rest, we hinder the mind’s grasp and hold, in giving it so many
things to seize upon; some things we should only offer to it; tie it to
others, and with others incorporate it.  it can [[feel]] and discern all
things, but ought to feed upon nothing but itself; and should be
instructed in what properly concerns itself, and that is properly of its
own having and substance.  the laws [[law]] of [[nature]] [[teach]] us what justly we
need.  after the sages have told us that no one is indigent according to
nature, and that every one is so according to [[opinion]], they very subtly
distinguish betwixt the desires [[desire]] that proceed from her, and those that
proceed from the disorder of our own fancy: those of which we can see the
end are hers; those that fly before us, and of which we can see no end,
are our own: the [[poverty]] of goods [[good]] is easily cured; the [[poverty]] of the
soul is irreparable:

         “nam si, quod satis est homini, id satis esse potesset
          hoc sat erat: nunc, quum hoc non est, qui credimus porro
          divitias ullas animum mi explere potesse?”

     [“for if what is for [[man]] enough, could be enough, it were enough;
     but since it is not so, how can i [[believe]] that any [[wealth]] can give
     my [[mind]] content.”--lucilius aped nonium marcellinum, v. sec. 98.]

socrates, seeing a [[great]] quantity of riches [[rich]], jewels, and furniture
carried in pomp through his [[city]]:  “how many things,” said he, “i do not
desire!”--[cicero, tusc.  quaes., v. 32.]--metrodorus lived on twelve
ounces a day, epicurus upon less; metrocles slept in winter abroad
amongst sheep, in summer in the cloisters of churches [[church]]:

               “sufficit ad id natura, quod poscit.”

          [“nature suffices for what he requires.”--seneca, ep., 90.]

cleanthes lived by the [[labour]] of his own hands, and boasted that
cleanthes, if he would, could yet maintain another cleanthes.

if that which [[nature]] exactly and originally requires of us for the
conservation of our being be too little (as in [[truth]] what it is, and how
good cheap [[life]] may be maintained, cannot be [[better]] expressed than by
this consideration, that it is so little that by its littleness it
escapes the gripe and shock of fortune), let us allow ourselves a little
more; let us call every one of our habits and conditions [[nature]]; let us
rate and treat ourselves by this measure; let us stretch our
appurtenances and accounts so far; for so far, i fancy, we have some
excuse.  custom is a second [[nature]], and no less powerful.  what is
wanting to my custom, i reckon is wanting to me; and i should be almost
as well content that they took away my [[life]] as cut me short in the way
wherein i have so long lived.  i am no longer in condition for any great
change, nor to put myself into a new and unwonted course, not even to
augmentation.  ‘tis [[past]] the [[time]] for me to become other than what i am;
and as i should [[complain]] of any [[great]] [[good]] hap that should now befall me,
that it came not in [[time]] to be enjoyed:

               “quo mihi fortunas, si non conceditur uti?”

     [“what is the [[good]] [[fortune]] to me, if it is not granted to me
     to use it.”--horace, ep., i. 5, 12.]

so should i [[complain]] of any inward acquisition.  it were almost better
never, than so late, to become an honest [[man]], and well fit to [[live]], when
one has no longer to [[live]].  i, who am about to make my exit out of the
world, would easily resign to any newcomer, who should [[desire]] it, all the
prudence i am now acquiring in the world’s commerce; after meat, mustard.
i have no need of goods [[good]] of which i can make no use; of what use is
knowledge to him who has lost his head?  ‘tis an injury and unkindness in
fortune to tender us presents [[present]] that will only inspire us with a just
despite that we had them not in their due season.  guide me no more; i
can no longer go.  of so many parts as make up a sufficiency, patience is
the most sufficient.  give the capacity of an excellent treble to the
chorister who has rotten lungs, and eloquence to a hermit exiled into the
deserts of arabia.  there needs no art [[arts]] to [[help]] a fall; the end finds
itself of itself at the conclusion of every affair.  my [[world]] is at an
end, my form expired; i am totally of the [[past]], and am bound to authorise
it, and to conform my outgoing to it.  i will here declare, by way of
example, that the pope’s late ten days’ diminution

     [gregory xiii., in 1582, reformed the calendar, and, in consequence,
     in [[france]] they all at once passed from the 9th to the 20th
     december.]

has taken me so aback that i cannot well reconcile myself to it; i belong
to the years wherein we kept another [[kind]] of account.  so ancient and so
long a custom challenges my adherence to it, so that i am constrained to
be somewhat heretical on that point incapable of any, though corrective,
innovation.  my [[imagination]], in spite of my teeth, always pushes me ten
days forward or backward, and is ever murmuring in my ears: “this rule
concerns those who are to begin to be.”  if health itself, sweet as it
is, returns to me by fits, ‘tis rather to give me cause of regret than
possession of it; i have no place left to keep it in.  [[time]] leaves me;
without which nothing can be possessed.  oh, what little account should i
make of those [[great]] elective dignities that i see in such esteem in the
world, that are never conferred but upon [[men]] who are taking leave of it;
wherein they do not so much regard how well the [[man]] will discharge his
trust, as how short his administration will be: from the very entry they
look at the exit.  in short, i am about finishing this [[man]], and not
rebuilding another.  by long use, this form is in me turned into
substance, and [[fortune]] into [[nature]].

i say, therefore, that every one of us feeble creatures is excusable in
thinking that to be his own which is comprised under this measure; but
withal, beyond these limits, ‘tis nothing but confusion; ‘tis the largest
extent we can grant to our own claims.  the more we amplify our need and
our possession, so much the more do we expose ourselves to the blows of
fortune and adversities.  the [[career]] of our desires [[desire]] ought to be
circumscribed and restrained to a short limit of the nearest and most
contiguous commodities; and their course ought, moreover, to be performed
not in a [[right]] line, that ends elsewhere, but in a circle, of which the
two points, by a short wheel, meet and terminate in ourselves.  actions
that are carried on without this reflection--a near and essential
reflection, i mean--such as those of ambitious and avaricious [[men]], and so
many more as run point-blank, and to whose [[career]] always carries them
before themselves, such actions, i say; are erroneous and sickly.

most of our [[business]] is farce:

               “mundus universus exercet histrioniam.”
                --[petronius arbiter, iii. 8.]

we must play our part properly, but withal as a part of a borrowed
personage; we must not make real essence of a mask and outward
appearance; nor of a [[strange]] [[person]], our own; we cannot distinguish the
skin from the shirt: ‘tis enough to meal the face, without mealing the
breast.  i see some who transform and transubstantiate themselves into as
many new shapes and new beings as they undertake new employments; and who
strut and fume even to the [[heart]] and liver, and carry their [[state]] along
with them even to the close-stool: i cannot make them distinguish the
salutations made to themselves from those made to their commission, their
train, or their mule:

     “tantum se fortunx permittunt, etiam ut naturam dediscant.”

     [“they so much give themselves up to [[fortune]], as even to unlearn
     [[nature]].”--quintus curtius, iii. 2.]

they swell and puff up their souls [[soul]], and their [[natural]] way of speaking,
according to the height of their magisterial place.  the mayor of
bordeaux and montaigne have ever been two by very manifest separation.
because one is an advocate or a financier, he must not ignore the knavery
there is in such callings; an honest [[man]] is not accountable for the vice
or absurdity of his employment, and ought not on that account refuse to
take the calling upon him: ‘tis the usage of his [[country]], and there is
money to be got by it; a [[man]] must [[live]] by the [[world]]; and make his [[best]] of
it, such as it is.  but the [[judgment]] of an [[emperor]] ought to be above his
empire, and see and consider it as a [[foreign]] accident; and he ought to
know how to enjoy himself apart from it, and to communicate himself as
james and peter, to himself, at all events.

i cannot engage myself so deep and so entire; when my will gives me to
anything, ‘tis not with so [[violent]] an obligation that my [[judgment]] is
infected with it.  in the [[present]] broils of this [[kingdom]], my own interest
has not made me blind to the laudable qualities of our adversaries, nor
to those that are reproachable in those [[men]] of our party.  others adore
all of their own side; for my part, i do not so much as excuse most
things in those of mine: a [[good]] [[work]] has never the worst grace with me
for being made against me.  the knot of the controversy excepted, i have
always kept myself in equanimity and pure indifference:

     “neque extra necessitates belli praecipuum odium gero;”

     [“nor bear particular [[hatred]] beyond the necessities of [[war]].”]

for which i am pleased with myself; and the more because i see others
commonly fail in the contrary direction.  such as extend their anger and
hatred beyond the dispute in [[question]], as most [[men]] do, show that they
spring from some other [[occasion]] and private cause; like one who, being
cured of an ulcer, has yet a fever remaining, by which it appears that
the ulcer had another more concealed beginning.  the [[reason]] is that they
are not concerned in the [[common]] cause, because it is wounding to the
state and general interest; but are only nettled by [[reason]] of their
particular concern.  this is why they are so especially animated, and to
a [[degree]] so far beyond [[justice]] and [[public]] [[reason]]:

          “non tam omnia universi, quam ea, quae ad quemque pertinent,
          singuli carpebant.”

     [“every one was not so much angry against things in general, as
     against those that particularly concern himself.”
      --livy, xxxiv. 36.]

i would have the advantage on our side; but if it be not, i shall not run
mad.  i am heartily for the [[right]] party; but i do not want to be taken
notice of as an especial [[enemy]] to others, and beyond the general quarrel.
i marvellously challenge this vicious form of [[opinion]]: “he is of the
league because he admires the graciousness of monsieur de guise; he is
astonished at the [[king]] of navarre’s energy, therefore he is a huguenot;
he finds this to say of the manners of the [[king]], he is therefore
seditious in his [[heart]].”  and i did not grant to the magistrate himself
that he did well in condemning a [[book]] because it had placed a heretic
--[theodore de beza.]--amongst the [[best]] poets of the [[time]].  shall we not
dare to say of a thief that he has a handsome leg?  if a woman be a
strumpet, must it needs [[follow]] that she has a foul smell?  did they in
the wisest ages [[age]] revoke the proud title of capitolinus they had before
conferred on marcus manlius as conservator of [[religion]] and the public
liberty, and stifle the memory of his liberality, his feats of arms, and
military recompenses granted to his valour, because he, afterwards
aspired to the sovereignty, to the prejudice of the laws [[law]] of his [[country]]?
if we take a [[hatred]] against an advocate, he will not be allowed the next
day to be eloquent.  i have elsewhere spoken of the zeal that pushed on
worthy [[men]] to the like faults [[fault]].  for my part, i can say, “such an one does
this thing ill, and another thing virtuously and well.”  so in the
prognostication or sinister events of affairs they would have every one
in his party blind or a blockhead, and that our persuasion and judgment
should subserve not [[truth]], but to the project of our desires [[desire]].  i should
rather incline towards the other extreme; so much i [[fear]] being suborned
by my [[desire]]; to which may be added that i am a little tenderly
distrustful of things that i [[wish]].

i have in my [[time]] seen wonders in the indiscreet and prodigious facility
of [[people]] in suffering their hopes [[hope]] and [[belief]] to be [[led]] and governed,
which way [[best]] pleased and served their leaders, despite a hundred
mistakes one upon another, despite mere dreams [[dream]] and phantasms.  i no more
wonder at those who have been blinded and seduced by the fooleries of
apollonius and mahomet.  their sense and understanding are absolutely
taken away by their passion; their discretion has no more any other
choice than that which smiles upon them and encourages their cause.
i had principally observed this in the beginning of our intestine
distempers; that other, which has sprung up since, in imitating, has
surpassed it; by which i am satisfied that it is a quality inseparable
from popular errors; after the first, that rolls, opinions [[opinion]] drive on one
another like waves with the wind: a [[man]] is not a member of the [[body]], if
it be in his [[power]] to forsake it, and if he do not roll the [[common]] way.
but, doubtless, they [[wrong]] the just side when they go about to assist it
with fraud; i have ever been against that practice: ‘tis only fit to work
upon [[weak]] heads; for the sound, there are surer and more honest ways to
keep up their [[courage]] and to excuse adverse accidents.

heaven never saw a greater animosity than that betwixt caesar and pompey,
nor ever shall; and yet i observe, methinks, in those brave souls [[soul]],
a [[great]] moderation towards one another: it was a [[jealousy]] of [[honour]] and
command, which did not transport them to a furious and indiscreet [[hatred]],
and was without malignity and detraction: in their hottest exploits upon
one another, i discover some remains of [[respect]] and good-will: and am
therefore of [[opinion]] that, had, it been possible, each of them would
rather have done his [[business]] without the ruin of the other than with it.
take notice how much otherwise matters went with marius and sylla.

we must not precipitate ourselves so headlong after our affections and
interests.  as, when i was [[young]], i opposed myself to the [[progress]] of
love which i perceived to advance too fast upon me, and had a [[care]] lest
it should at [[last]] become so pleasing as to [[force]], captivate, and wholly
reduce me to its [[mercy]]: so i do the same upon all other occasions [[occasion]] where
my will is running on with too warm an appetite.  i lean opposite to the
side it inclines to; as i find it going to plunge and make itself drunk
with its own wine; i evade nourishing its [[pleasure]] so far, that i cannot
recover it without infinite loss.  souls [[soul]] that, through their own
stupidity, only discern things by halves, have this [[happiness]], that they
smart less with hurtful things: ‘tis a [[spiritual]] leprosy that has some
show of health, and such a health as [[philosophy]] does not altogether
contemn; but yet we have no [[reason]] to call it [[wisdom]], as we often do.
and after this manner some one anciently mocked diogeries, who, in the
depth of winter and quite naked, went embracing an image of snow for a
trial of his endurance: the other seeing him in this position, “art thou
now very cold?”  said he.  “not at all,” replied diogenes.  “why, then,”
 pursued the other, “what difficult and exemplary thing dost thou think
thou doest in embracing that snow?”  to take a true measure of constancy,
one must necessarily [[know]] what the suffering is.

but souls [[soul]] that are to meet with adverse events and the injuries of
fortune, in their depth and sharpness, that are to weigh and taste them
according to their [[natural]] weight and bitterness, let such show their
skill in avoiding the causes and diverting the blow.  what did [[king]] cotys
do?  he paid liberally for the [[rich]] and beautiful vessel that had been
presented to him, but, seeing it was exceedingly brittle, he immediately
broke it betimes, to prevent so easy a matter of displeasure against his
servants. in like manner, i have willingly avoided all confusion in my
affairs, and never coveted to have my estate contiguous to those of my
relations, and such with whom i coveted a strict [[friendship]]; for thence
matter of unkindness and falling out often proceeds.  i formerly loved
hazardous games of cards and dice; but have long since left them off,
only for this [[reason]] that, with whatever [[good]] air i carried my losses,
i could not [[help]] feeling vexed within.  a [[man]] of [[honour]], who ought to be
touchily sensible of the [[lie]] or of an insult, and who is not to take a
scurvy excuse for satisfaction, should avoid occasions [[occasion]] of dispute.
i shun melancholy, crabbed [[men]], as i would the plague; and in matters i
cannot talk of without emotion and concern i never meddle, if not
compelled by my [[duty]]:

               “melius non incipient, quam desinent.”

     [“they had [[better]] never to begin than to have to desist.”
      --seneca, ep., 72.]

the surest way, therefore, is to prepare one’s [[self]] beforehand for
occasions.

i [[know]] very well that some [[wise]] [[men]] have taken another way, and have not
feared to grapple and engage to the utmost upon several subjects [[subject]] these
are confident of their own [[strength]], under which they [[protect]] themselves
in all ill successes, making their patience wrestle and contend with
disaster:

               “velut rupes, vastum quae prodit in aequor,
               obvia ventorum furiis, expostaque ponto,
               vim cunctam atque minas perfert coelique marisque;
               ipsa immota manens.”

     [“as a rock, which projects into the vast ocean, exposed to the
     furious winds and the raging sea, defies the [[force]] and menaces of
     [[sky]] and sea, itself unshaken.”--virgil, aeneid, x. 693.]

let us not attempt these examples [[example]]; we shall never come up to them.  they
set themselves resolutely, and without agitation, to behold the ruin of
their [[country]], which possessed and commanded all their will: this is too
much, and too hard a task for our commoner souls [[soul]].  cato gave up the
noblest [[life]] that ever was upon this account; we meaner spirits must fly
from the storm as far as we can; we must provide for sentiment, and not
for patience, and evade the blows we cannot meet.  zeno, seeing
chremonides, a [[young]] [[man]] whom he loved, draw near to sit down by him,
suddenly started up; and cleanthes demanding of him the [[reason]] why he did
so, “i hear,” said he, “that physicians especially order repose, and
forbid emotion in all tumours.”  [[socrates]] does not say: “do not surrender
to the charms of [[beauty]]; stand your ground, and do your utmost to oppose
it.”  “fly it,” says he; “shun the [[fight]] and encounter of it, as of a
powerful poison that darts and wounds at a distance.”  and his good
disciple, feigning or reciting, but, in my [[opinion]], rather reciting than
feigning, the rare perfections of the [[great]] cyrus, makes him distrustful
of his own [[strength]] to resist the charms of the [[divine]] [[beauty]] of that
illustrous panthea, his captive, and committing the visiting and keeping
her to another, who could not have so much [[liberty]] as himself.  and the
holy ghost in like manner:

                    “ne nos inducas in tentationem.”

          [“lead us not into temptation.”--st. matthew, vi. 13.]

we do not [[pray]] that our [[reason]] may not be combated and overcome by
concupiscence, but that it should not be so much as tried by it; that we
should not be brought into a [[state]] wherein we are so much as to suffer
the approaches, solicitations, and temptations of [[sin]]: and we beg of
almighty [[god]] to keep our consciences quiet, fully and perfectly delivered
from all commerce of [[evil]].

such as say that they have [[reason]] for their revenging passion, or any
other sort of troublesome agitation of [[mind]], often say true, as things
now are, but not as they were: they speak to us when the causes of their
error are by themselves nourished and advanced; but look backward--recall
these causes to their beginning--and there you will put them to a
nonplus.  will they have their faults [[fault]] less, for being of longer
continuance; and that of an [[unjust]] beginning, the sequel can be just?
whoever shall [[desire]] the [[good]] of his [[country]], as i do, without fretting
or pining himself, will be troubled, but will not swoon to see it
threatening either its own ruin, or a no less ruinous continuance; poor
vessel, that the waves, the winds, and the pilot toss and steer to so
contrary designs!

                        “in tam diversa magister
                         ventus et unda trahunt.”

he who does not gape after the favour of princes [[prince]], as after a thing he
cannot [[live]] without, does not much concern himself at the coldness of
their reception and countenance, nor at the inconstancy of their wills.
he who does not brood over his [[children]] or his honours [[honour]] with a slavish
propension, ceases not to [[live]] commodiously enough after their loss.  he
who does [[good]] principally for his own satisfaction will not be much
troubled to see [[men]] [[judge]] of his actions contrary to his [[merit]].  a
quarter of an ounce of patience will provide sufficiently against such
inconveniences.  i find ease in this receipt, redeeming myself in the
beginning as [[good]] cheap as i can; and find that by this means i have
escaped much trouble and many difficulties.  with very little ado i stop
the first sally of my emotions, and leave the [[subject]] that begins to be
troublesome before it transports me.  he who stops not the start will
never be able to stop the course; he who cannot keep them out will never,
get them out when they are once got in; and he who cannot arrive at the
beginning will never arrive at the end of all.  nor will he bear the fall
who cannot sustain the shock:

     “etenim ipsae se impellunt, ubi semel a ratione discessum est;
     ipsaque sibi imbecillitas indulget, in altumque provehitur
     imprudens, nec reperit locum consistendi.”

     [“for they throw themselves headlong when once they lose their
     [[reason]]; and infirmity so far indulges itself, and from want of
     prudence is carried out into deep water, nor finds a place to
     shelter it.”--cicero, tusc. quaes., iv. 18.]

i am betimes sensible of the little breezes that begin to sing and
whistle within, forerunners of the storm:

                              “ceu flamina prima
               cum deprensa fremunt sylvis et caeca volutant
               murmura, venturos nautis prodentia ventos.”

     [“as the breezes, pent in the woods, first send out dull murmurs,
     announcing the approach of winds to mariners.”--aeneid, x. 97.]

how often have i done myself a manifest [[injustice]] to avoid the hazard of
having yet a worse done me by the judges [[judge]], after an [[age]] of vexations,
dirty and vile practices, more enemies [[enemy]] to my [[nature]] than [[fire]] or the
rack?

     “convenit a litibus, quantum licet, et nescio an paulo plus etiam
     quam licet, abhorrentem esse: est enim non modo liberale, paululum
     nonnunquam de suo jure decedere, sed interdum etiam fructuosum.”

     [“a [[man]] should abhor lawsuits as much as he may, and i [[know]] not
     whether not something more; for ‘tis not only liberal, but sometimes
     also advantageous, too, a little to recede from one’s [[right]].
     --“cicero, de offic., ii. 18.]

were we [[wise]], we ought to rejoice and boast, as i one day heard a young
gentleman of a [[good]] [[family]] very innocently do, that his [[mother]] had lost
her cause, as if it had been a cough, a fever, or something very
troublesome to keep.  even the favours that [[fortune]] might have given me
through relationship or acquaintance with those who have sovereign
authority in those affairs, i have very conscientiously and very
carefully avoided employing them to the prejudice of others, and of
advancing my pretensions above their true [[right]].  in fine, i have so much
prevailed by my endeavours (and happily i may say it) that i am to this
day a virgin from all suits in [[law]]; though i have had very [[fair]] offers
made me, and with very just title, would i have hearkened to them, and a
virgin from quarrels too.  i have almost passed over a long [[life]] without
any offence of moment, either active or passive, or without ever hearing
a worse word than my own name: a rare favour of [[heaven]].

our [[greatest]] agitations have ridiculous springs and causes: what ruin did
our [[last]] duke of burgundy run into about a cartload of sheepskins!
and was not the graving of a seal the first and principal cause of the
greatest commotion that this machine of the [[world]] ever underwent?
--[the civil [[war]] between marius and sylla; see plutarch’s [[life]] of marius,
c. 3.]--for pompey and caesar were but the offsets and continuation of
the two others: and i have in my [[time]] seen the wisest heads in this
kingdom assembled with [[great]] [[ceremony]], and at the [[public]] expense, about
treaties and agreements, of which the true decision, in the meantime,
absolutely depended upon the ladies’ cabinet council, and the inclination
of some bit of a woman.

the poets very well understood this when they put all greece and [[asia]] to
fire and [[sword]] about an apple.  look why that [[man]] hazards his [[life]] and
honour upon the [[fortune]] of his rapier and dagger; let him acquaint you
with the [[occasion]] of the quarrel; he cannot do it without blushing: the
occasion is so idle and frivolous.

a little thing will engage you in it; but being once embarked, all the
cords draw; [[great]] provisions are then required, more hard and more
important.  how much easier is it not to enter in than it is to get out?
now we should proceed contrary to the reed, which, at its first
springing, produces [[produce]] a long and straight shoot, but afterwards, as if
tired and out of breath, it runs into thick and frequent joints and
knots, as so many pauses which demonstrate that it has no more its first
vigour and firmness; ‘twere [[better]] to begin gently and coldly, and to
keep one’s breath and vigorous efforts for the height and stress of the
business.  we guide affairs in their beginnings, and have them in our own
power; but afterwards, when they are once at [[work]], ‘tis they that guide
and govern us, and we are to [[follow]] them.

yet do i not mean to say that this counsel has discharged me of all
difficulty, and that i have not often had enough to do to curb and
restrain my [[passions]]; they are not always to be governed according to the
measure of occasions [[occasion]], and often have their entries very sharp and
violent.  but still [[good]] fruit and [[profit]] may thence be reaped; except
for those who in well-doing are not satisfied with any benefit, if
reputation be wanting; for, in [[truth]], such an effect is not valued but by
every one to himself; you are [[better]] contented, but not more esteemed,
seeing you reformed yourself before you got into the whirl of the dance,
or that the provocative matter was in sight.  yet not in this only, but
in all other duties [[duty]] of [[life]] also, the way of those who aim at [[honour]] is
very different from that they proceed by, who propose to themselves order
and [[reason]].  i find some who rashly and furiously rush into the lists and
cool in the course.  as plutarch says, that those who, through false
shame, are soft and facile to grant whatever is [[desired]] of them, are
afterwards as facile to break their word and to recant; so he who enters
lightly into a quarrel is apt to go as lightly out of it.  the same
difficulty that keeps me from entering into it, would, when once hot and
engaged in quarrel, incite me to maintain it with [[great]] obstinacy and
resolution.  ‘tis the [[tyranny]] of custom; when a [[man]] is once engaged; he
must go through with it, or [[die]].  “undertake coolly,” said bias,
“but pursue with ardour.”  for want of prudence, [[men]] fall into want of
courage, which is still more intolerable.

most accommodations of the quarrels of these days of ours are shameful
and false; we only seek to save appearances, and in the meantime betray
and disavow our true intentions; we salve over the [[fact]].  we [[know]] very
well how we said the thing, and in what sense we spoke it, and the
company [[know]] it, and our [[friends]] whom we have wished to make sensible of
our advantage, [[understand]] it well enough too: ‘tis at the expense of our
frankness and of the [[honour]] of our [[courage]], that we disown our thoughts [[thought]],
and seek refuge in falsities, to make matters up.  we give ourselves the
lie, to excuse the [[lie]] we have given to another.  you are not to consider
if your word or action may admit of another interpretation; ‘tis your own
true and sincere interpretation, your real meaning in what you said or
did, that you are thenceforward to maintain, whatever it cost you.  men
speak to your [[virtue]] and [[conscience]], which are not things to be put under
a mask; let us leave these pitiful ways and expedients to the jugglers of
the [[law]].  the excuses and reparations that i see every day made and given
to repair indiscretion, seem to me more scandalous than the indiscretion
itself.  it were [[better]] to affront your adversary a second [[time]] than to
offend yourself by giving him so unmanly a satisfaction.  you have braved
him in your heat and anger, and you would flatter and appease him in your
cooler and [[better]] sense; and by that means lay yourself lower and at his
feet, whom before you pretended to overtop.  i do not find anything a
gentleman can say so vicious in him as unsaying what he has said is
infamous, when to unsay it is authoritatively extracted from him;
forasmuch as obstinacy is more excusable in a [[man]] of [[honour]] than
pusillanimity.  [[passions]] are as easy for me to evade, as they are hard
for me to moderate:

          “exscinduntur facilius ammo, quam temperantur.”

     [“they are more easily to be eradicated than governed.”]

he who cannot attain the [[noble]] stoical impassibility, let him secure
himself in the bosom of this popular stolidity of mine; what they
performed by [[virtue]], i inure myself to do by temperament.  the middle
region harbours storms and tempests; the two extremes, of philosophers
and peasants, concur in tranquillity and [[happiness]]:

               “felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,
               atque metus omnes et inexorabile fatum
               subjecit pedibus, strepitumque acherontis avari!
               fortunatus et ille, deos qui novit agrestes,
               panaque, sylvanumque senem, nymphasque sorores!”

     [“happy is he who could discover the causes of things, and place
     under his feet all fears [[fear]] and inexorable [[fate]], and the sound of
     rapacious acheron: he is blest who knows [[know]] the [[country]] gods, and pan,
     and old sylvanus, and the sister nymphs [[nymph]].”--virgil, georg., ii. 490.]

the births of all things are [[weak]] and tender; and therefore we should
have our [[eyes]] intent on beginnings; for as when, in its infancy, the
danger is not perceived, so when it is grown up, the remedy is as little
to be found.  i had every day encountered a million of crosses, harder to
digest in the [[progress]] of [[ambition]], than it has been hard for me to curb
the [[natural]] propension that inclined me to it:

                    “jure perhorrui
                    lath conspicuum tollere verticem.”

          [“i ever justly feared to raise my head too high.”
           --horace, od.,iii. 16, 18.]

all [[public]] actions are [[subject]] to uncertain and various interpretations;
for too many heads [[judge]] of them.  some say of this civic employment of
mine (and i am willing to say a word or two about it, not that it is
worth so much, but to give an account of my manners in such things), that
i have behaved myself in it as a [[man]] who is too supine and of a languid
temperament; and they have some colour for what they say.  i endeavoured
to keep my [[mind]] and my thoughts [[thought]] in repose;

          “cum semper natura, tum etiam aetate jam quietus;”

          [“as being always quiet by [[nature]], so also now by [[age]].”
           --cicero, de petit. consul., c. 2.]

and if they sometimes lash out upon some rude and sensible impression,
‘tis in [[truth]] without my [[advice]].  yet from this [[natural]] heaviness of
mine, [[men]] ought not to conclude a total inability in me (for want of care
and want of sense are two very different things), and much less any
unkindness or ingratitude towards that corporation who employed the
utmost means they had in their [[power]] to oblige me, both before they knew
me and after; and they did much more for me in choosing me anew than in
conferring that [[honour]] upon me at first.  i [[wish]] them all imaginable
good; and assuredly had [[occasion]] been, there is nothing i would have
spared for their service; i did for them as i would have done for myself.
‘tis a [[good]], warlike, and generous [[people]], but capable of [[obedience]] and
discipline, and of whom the [[best]] use may be made, if well guided.  they
say also that my administration passed over without leaving any mark or
trace.  good!  they moreover accuse my cessation in a [[time]] when everybody
almost was convicted of doing too much.  i am impatient to be doing where
my will spurs me on; but this itself is an [[enemy]] to perseverance.  let
him who will make use of me according to my own way, employ me in affairs
where vigour and [[liberty]] are required, where a direct, short, and,
moreover, a hazardous conduct are necessary; i may do something; but if
it must be long, subtle, laborious, artificial and intricate, he had
better call in somebody else.  all important offices are not necessarily
difficult: i came prepared to do somewhat rougher [[work]], had there been
great [[occasion]]; for it is in my [[power]] to do something more than i do, or
than i [[love]] to do.  i did not, to my [[knowledge]], omit anything that my
duty really required.  i easily forgot those offices that [[ambition]] mixes
with [[duty]] and palliates with its title; these are they that, for the most
part, fill the [[eyes]] and ears, and give [[men]] the most satisfaction; not the
thing but the appearance contents them; if they hear no noise, they think
men sleep.  my [[humour]] is no friend to tumult; i could appease a commotion
without commotion, and chastise a disorder without being myself
disorderly; if i stand in need of anger and inflammation, i borrow it,
and put it on.  my manners are languid, rather faint than sharp.  i do
not condemn a magistrate who sleeps, provided the [[people]] under his charge
sleep as well as he: the laws [[law]] in that case sleep too.  for my part, i
commend a gliding, staid, and silent [[life]]:

          “neque submissam et abjectam, neque se efferentem;”

          [“neither [[subject]] and abject, nor obtrusive.”
           --cicero, de offic., i. 34]

my [[fortune]] will have it so.  i am descended from a [[family]] that has lived
without lustre or tumult, and, [[time]] out of [[mind]], particularly ambitious
of a [[character]] for probity.

our [[people]] nowadays are so bred up to bustle and ostentation, that good
nature, moderation, equability, constancy, and such like quiet and
obscure qualities, are no more [[thought]] on or regarded.  rough bodies [[body]] make
themselves [[felt]]; the smooth are imperceptibly handled: sickness is [[felt]],
health little or not at all; no more than the oils that foment us, in
comparison of the pains [[pain]] for which we are fomented.  ‘tis acting for one’s
particular [[reputation]] and [[profit]], not for the [[public]] [[good]], to refer that
to be done in the [[public]] squares which one may do in the council chamber;
and to noon day what might have been done the night before; and to be
jealous to do that himself which his colleague can do as well as he; so
were some surgeons of greece wont to perform their operations upon
scaffolds in the sight of the [[people]], to draw more practice and [[profit]].
they [[think]] that [[good]] rules [[rule]] cannot be understood but by the sound of
trumpet.  [[ambition]] is not a [[vice]] of little [[people]], nor of such modest
means as ours.  one said to alexander: “your [[father]] will leave you a
great dominion, easy and pacific”; this [[youth]] was emulous of his father’s
victories and of the [[justice]] of his [[government]]; he would not have enjoyed
the [[empire]] of the [[world]] in ease and [[peace]].  alcibiades, in [[plato]], had
rather [[die]] [[young]], beautiful, [[rich]], [[noble]], and learned, and all this in
full excellence, than to stop short of such condition; this disease is,
peradventure, excusable in so [[strong]] and so full a [[soul]].  when wretched
and dwarfish little souls [[soul]] cajole and [[deceive]] themselves, and [[think]] to
spread their fame for having given [[right]] [[judgment]] in an affair, or
maintained the discipline of the guard of a gate of their [[city]], the more
they [[think]] to exalt their heads the more they show their tails.  this
little well-doing has neither [[body]] nor [[life]]; it vanishes in the first
mouth, and goes no further than from one street to another.  talk of it
by all means to your [[son]] or your servant, like that old fellow who,
having no other auditor of his praises [[praise]] nor approver of his valour,
boasted to his chambermaid, crying, “o perrete, what a brave, clever man
hast thou for thy master!”  at the worst, talk of it to yourself, like a
councillor of my acquaintance, who, having disgorged a whole cartful of
law jargon with [[great]] heat and as [[great]] folly, coming out of the council
chamber to make water, was heard very complacently to mutter betwixt his
teeth:

          “non nobis, domine, non nobis, sed nomini tuo da gloriam.”

     [“not unto us, o [[lord]], not to us: but unto thy name be the [[glory]].”
      --psalm cxiii. i.]

he who gets it of nobody else, let him [[pay]] himself out of his own purse.

fame is not prostituted at so cheap a rate: rare and exemplary actions,
to which it is due, would not endure the company of this prodigious crowd
of petty daily performances.  marble may exalt your titles, as much as
you please, for having repaired a rod of wall or cleansed a [[public]] sewer;
but not [[men]] of sense.  renown does not [[follow]] all [[good]] deeds, if novelty
and difficulty be not conjoined; nay, so much as mere esteem, according
to the stoics, is not due to every action that proceeds from [[virtue]]; nor
will they allow him bare thanks who, out of temperance, abstains from an
old blear-eyed crone.  those who have known the admirable qualities of
scipio africanus, deny him the [[glory]] that panaetius attributes to him, of
being abstinent from gifts, as a [[glory]] not so much his as that of his
age.  we have pleasures [[pleasure]] suitable to our lot; let us not usurp those of
grandeur: our own are more [[natural]], and by so much more solid and sure,
as they are lower.  if not for that of [[conscience]], yet at least for
ambition’s sake, let us reject [[ambition]]; let us disdain that thirst of
honour and renown, so low and mendicant, that it makes us beg it of all
sorts of [[people]]:

          “quae est ista laus quae: possit e macello peti?”

     [“what [[praise]] is that which is to be got in the market-place (meat
     market)?”  cicero, de fin., ii. 15.]

by abject means, and at what cheap rate soever: ‘tis dishonour to be so
honoured.  let us learn to be no more greedy, than we are capable, of
glory.  to be puffed up with every action that is [[innocent]] or of use, is
only for those with whom such things are extraordinary and rare: they
will value it as it costs them.  the more a [[good]] effect makes a noise,
the more do i abate of its goodness as i suspect that it was more
performed for the noise, than upon account of the goodness: exposed upon
the stall, ‘tis half sold.  those actions have much more grace and
lustre, that slip from the hand of him that does them, negligently and
without noise, and that some honest [[man]] thereafter finds out and raises
from the shade, to [[produce]] it to the [[light]] upon its own account,

          “mihi quidem laudabiliora videntur omnia, quae sine
          venditatione, et sine populo teste fiunt,”

     [“all things truly seem more laudable to me that are performed
     without ostentation, and without the testimony of the [[people]].”
      --cicero, tusc.  quaes., ii. 26.]

says the most ostentatious [[man]] that ever lived.

i had but to conserve and to continue, which are silent and insensible
effects: innovation is of [[great]] lustre; but ‘tis interdicted in this [[age]],
when we are pressed upon and have nothing to defend ourselves from but
novelties.  to forbear doing is often as generous as to do; but ‘tis less
in the [[light]], and the little [[good]] i have in me is of this [[kind]].  in fine,
occasions in this employment of mine have been confederate with my
humour, and i heartily thank them for it.  is there any who desires [[desire]] to be
sick, that he may see his physician at [[work]]? and would not the physician
deserve to be whipped who should [[wish]] the plague amongst us, that he
might put his art [[arts]] in practice?  i have never been of that wicked [[humour]],
and [[common]] enough, to [[desire]] that troubles and disorders in this city
should elevate and [[honour]] my [[government]]; i have ever heartily contributed
all i could to their tranquillity and ease.

he who will not thank me for the order, the sweet and silent calm that
has accompanied my administration, cannot, however, deprive me of the
share that belongs to me by title of my [[good]] [[fortune]].  and i am of such a
composition, that i would as willingly be lucky as [[wise]], and had rather
owe my successes purely to the favour of almighty [[god]], than to any
operation of my own.  i had sufficiently published to the [[world]] my
unfitness for such [[public]] offices; but i have something in me yet worse
than incapacity itself; which is, that i am not much displeased at it,
and that i do not much go about to cure it, considering the course of
life that i have proposed to myself.

neither have i satisfied myself in this employment; but i have very near
arrived at what i expected from my own performance, and have much
surpassed what i promised them with whom i had to do: for i am apt to
promise something less than what i am able to do, and than what i [[hope]] to
make [[good]].  i assure myself that i have left no offence or [[hatred]] behind
me; to leave regret or [[desire]] for me amongst them, i at least [[know]] very
well that i never much aimed at it:

              “mene huic confidere monstro!
               mene salis placidi vultum, fluctusque quietos
               ignorare?”

     [“should i place confidence in this monster?  should i be ignorant
     of the dangers of that seeming placid sea, those now quiet waves?”
      --virgil, aeneid, v. 849.]




chapter xi

of cripples

‘tis now two or three years ago that they made the year ten days shorter
in [[france]].--[by the adoption of the gregorian calendar.]--how many
changes may we expect should [[follow]] this reformation! it was really
moving [[heaven]] and [[earth]] at once.  yet nothing for all that stirs from its
place my neighbours still find their seasons of sowing and reaping, the
opportunities of doing their [[business]], the hurtful and propitious days,
dust at the same [[time]] where they had, [[time]] out of [[mind]], assigned them;
there was no more error perceived in our old use, than there is amendment
found in the alteration; so [[great]] an uncertainty there is throughout; so
gross, obscure, and obtuse is our perception.  ‘tis said that this
regulation might have been carried on with less inconvenience, by
subtracting for some years, according to the [[example]] of augustus, the
bissextile, which is in some sort a day of impediment and trouble, till
we had exactly satisfied this debt, the which itself is not done by this
correction, and we yet remain some days in arrear: and yet, by this
means, such order might be taken for the future, arranging that after the
revolution of such or such a number of years, the supernumerary day might
be always thrown out, so that we could not, henceforward, err above
four-and-twenty hours in our computation.  we have no other account of
time but years; the [[world]] has for many ages [[age]] made use of that only; and
yet it is a measure that to this day we are not agreed upon, and one that
we still [[doubt]] what form other nations have variously given to it, and
what was the true use of it.  what does this saying of some mean, that
the heavens [[heaven]] in growing old bow themselves down nearer towards us, and put
us into an uncertainty even of hours and days? and that which plutarch
says of the months, that astrology had not in his [[time]] determined as to
the motion of the moon; what a fine condition are we in to keep records
of things [[past]].

i was just now ruminating, as i often do, what a [[free]] and roving thing
human [[reason]] is.  i ordinarily see that [[men]], in things propounded to
them, more willingly study to find out reasons [[reason]] than to ascertain [[truth]]:
they slip over presuppositions, but are [[curious]] in examination of
consequences; they leave the things, and fly to the causes.  pleasant
talkers!  the [[knowledge]] of causes only concerns him who has the conduct
of things; not us, who are merely to undergo them, and who have perfectly
full and accomplished use of them, according to our need, without
penetrating into the original and essence; wine is none the more pleasant
to him who knows [[know]] its first faculties.  on the contrary, both the [[body]] and
the [[soul]] interrupt and weaken the [[right]] they have of the use of the world
and of themselves, by mixing with it the [[opinion]] of learning; effects
concern us, but the means not at all.  to determine and to distribute
appertain to superiority and command; as it does to subjection to accept.
let me reprehend our custom.  they commonly begin thus: “how is such a
thing done?”  whereas they should say, “is such a thing done?”  our
reason is able to create a hundred other worlds [[world]], and to find out the
beginnings and contexture; it needs neither matter nor foundation: let it
but run on, it builds as well in the air as on the [[earth]], and with
inanity as well as with matter:

                    “dare pondus idonea fumo.”

          [“able to give weight to smoke.”--persius, v. 20.]

i find that almost throughout we should say, “there is no such thing,”
 and should myself often make use of this [[answer]], but i dare not: for they
cry that it is an evasion produced from ignorance and weakness of
understanding; and i am fain, for the most part, to juggle for company,
and prate of frivolous subjects [[subject]] and tales that i [[believe]] not a word of;
besides that, in [[truth]], ‘tis a little rude and quarrelsome flatly to deny
a stated [[fact]]; and few [[people]] but will affirm, especially in things hard
to be believed, that they have seen them, or at least will name witnesses
whose [[authority]] will stop our mouths from contradiction.  in this way, we
know the foundations and means of things that never were; and the world
scuffles about a thousand questions [[question]], of which both the pro and the con
are false.

          “ita finitima sunt falsa veris, ut in praecipitem
          locum non debeat se sapiens committere.”

     [“false things are so near the true, that a [[wise]] [[man]] should not
     trust himself in a precipitous place”--cicero, acad., ii.  21.]

truth and lies [[lie]] are faced alike; their port, taste, and proceedings are
the same, and we look upon them with the same eye.  i find that we are
not only remiss in defending ourselves from deceit, but that we seek and
offer ourselves to be gulled; we [[love]] to entangle ourselves in vanity, as
a thing conformable to our being.

i have seen the birth of many [[miracles]] in my [[time]]; which, although they
were abortive, yet have we not failed to foresee what they would have
come to, had they lived their full [[age]].  ‘tis but finding the end of the
clew, and a [[man]] may wind off as much as he will; and there is a greater
distance betwixt nothing and the least thing in the [[world]] than there is
betwixt this and the [[greatest]].  now the first that are imbued with this
beginning of novelty, when they set out with their tale, find, by the
oppositions they meet with, where the difficulty of persuasion lies [[lie]], and
so caulk up that place with some false piece;

     [voltaire says of this passage, “he who would learn to [[doubt]] should
     [[read]] this whole [[chapter]] of montaigne, the least methodical of all
     [[philosophers]], but the wisest and most amiable.”
      --melanges historiques, xvii.  694, ed. of lefevre.]

besides that:

     “insita hominibus libido alendi de industria rumores,”

          [“men having a [[natural]] [[desire]] to nourish reports.”
           --livy, xxviii. 24.]

we naturally make a [[conscience]] of restoring what has been lent us,
without some usury and accession of our own.  the particular error first
makes the [[public]] error, and afterwards, in turn, the [[public]] error makes
the particular one; and thus all this vast fabric goes forming and piling
itself up from hand to hand, so that the remotest witness knows [[know]] more
about it than those who were nearest, and the [[last]] informed is better
persuaded than the first.

‘tis a [[natural]] [[progress]]; for whoever believes [[belief]] anything, thinks [[think]] it a work
of charity to persuade another into the same [[opinion]]; which the [[better]] to
do, he will make no difficulty of adding as much of his own invention as
he conceives necessary to his tale to encounter the [[resistance]] or want of
conception he meets with in others.  i myself, who make a great
conscience of lying, and am not very solicitous of giving credit and
authority to what i say, yet find that in the arguments i have in hand,
being heated with the opposition of another, or by the proper warmth of
my own narration, i swell and puff up my [[subject]] by voice, motion,
vigour, and [[force]] of words, and moreover, by extension and amplification,
not without some prejudice to the naked [[truth]]; but i do it conditionally
withal, that to the first who brings me to myself, and who asks me the
plain and bare [[truth]], i presently [[surrender]] my passion, and deliver the
matter to him without exaggeration, without emphasis, or any painting of
my own.  a quick and earnest way of speaking, as mine is, is apt to run
into hyperbole.  there is nothing to which [[men]] commonly are more inclined
than to make way for their own opinions [[opinion]]; where the ordinary means fail
us, we add command, [[force]], [[fire]], and [[sword]].  ‘tis a misfortune to be at
such a pass, that the [[best]] test of [[truth]] is the multitude of believers in
a crowd, where the number of fools [[fool]] so much exceeds the [[wise]]:

     “quasi vero quidquam sit tam valde, quam nil sapere, vulgare.”

          [“as if anything were so [[common]] as ignorance.”
           --cicero, de divin., ii.]

          “sanitatis patrocinium est, insanientium turba.”

     [“the multitude of fools [[fool]] is a protection to the [[wise]].”
      --st. augustine, de civit. dei, vi. 10.]

‘tis hard to resolve a man’s [[judgment]] against the [[common]] opinions [[opinion]]: the
first persuasion, taken from the very [[subject]] itself, possesses the
simple, and from them diffuses itself to the [[wise]], under the [[authority]] of
the number and antiquity of the witnesses.  for my part, what i should
not [[believe]] from one, i should not [[believe]] from a hundred and one: and i
do not [[judge]] opinions [[opinion]] by years.

‘tis not long since one of our princes [[prince]], in whom the gout had spoiled an
excellent [[nature]] and sprightly disposition, [[suffered]] himself to be so far
persuaded with the report made to him of the marvellous operations of a
certain [[priest]] who by words and gestures cured all sorts of diseases,
as to go a long [[journey]] to seek him out, and by the [[force]] of his mere
imagination, for some hours so persuaded and laid his legs asleep, as to
obtain that service from them they had long [[time]] forgotten.  had fortune
heaped up five or six such-like incidents, it had been enough to have
brought this miracle into [[nature]].  there was afterwards discovered so
much simplicity and so little art [[arts]] in the author of these performances,
that he was [[thought]] too contemptible to be punished, as would be thought
of most such things, were they well examined:

               “miramur ex intervallo fallentia.”

     [“we [[admire]] after an interval (or at a distance) things that
     [[deceive]].”--seneca, ep., 118, 2.]

so does our sight often represent to us [[strange]] images at a distance that
vanish on approaching near:

               “nunquam ad liquidum fama perducitur.”

               [“report is never fully substantiated.”
                --quintus curtius, ix. 2.]

‘tis wonderful from how many idle beginnings and frivolous causes such
famous impressions commonly, proceed.  this it is that obstructs
information; for whilst we seek out causes and solid and weighty ends,
worthy of so [[great]] a name, we lose the true ones; they escape our sight
by their littleness.  and, in [[truth]], a very prudent, diligent, and subtle
inquisition is required in such searches, indifferent, and not
prepossessed.  to this very hour, all these [[miracles]] and [[strange]] events
have concealed themselves from me: i have never seen greater monster or
miracle in the [[world]] than myself: one grows familiar with all strange
things by [[time]] and custom, but the more i frequent and the [[better]] i know
myself, the more does my own deformity astonish me, the less i understand
myself.

the principal [[right]] of advancing and producing such accidents is reserved
to [[fortune]].  passing the day before yesterday through a village two
leagues from my house, i found the place yet warm with a miracle that had
lately failed of [[success]] there, where with first the neighbourhood had
been several months amused; then the neighbouring provinces began to take
it up, and to run thither in [[great]] companies of all sorts of [[people]].
a [[young]] fellow of the place had one night in [[sport]] counterfeited the
voice of a spirit in his own house, without any other design at [[present]],
but only for [[sport]]; but this having succeeded with him [[better]] than he
expected, to extend his farce with more actors he associated with him a
stupid silly [[country]] girl, and at [[last]] there were three of them of the
same [[age]] and understanding, who from domestic, proceeded to [[public]],
preachings, hiding themselves under the altar of the [[church]], never
speaking but by night, and forbidding any [[light]] to be brought.  from
words which tended to the conversion of the [[world]], and threats of the day
of [[judgment]] (for these are subjects [[subject]] under the [[authority]] and reverence of
which imposture most securely lurks), they proceeded to visions and
gesticulations so simple and ridiculous that--nothing could hardly be so
gross in the sports [[sport]] of little [[children]].  yet had [[fortune]] never so little
favoured the design, who knows [[know]] to what height this juggling might have at
last arrived?  these [[poor]] devils [[devil]] are at [[present]] in prison, and are like
shortly to [[pay]] for the [[common]] folly; and i [[know]] not whether some judge
will not also make them smart for his.  we see clearly into this, which
is discovered; but in many things of the like [[nature]] that exceed our
knowledge, i am of [[opinion]] that we ought to suspend our [[judgment]], whether
as to rejection or as to reception.

great abuses [[abuse]] in the [[world]] are begotten, or, to speak more boldly, all the
abuses of the [[world]] are begotten, by our being taught to be afraid of
professing our ignorance, and that we are bound to accept all things we
are not able to refute: we speak of all things by precepts and decisions.
the style at [[rome]] was that even that which a witness deposed to having
seen with his own [[eyes]], and what a [[judge]] determined with his most certain
knowledge, was couched in this form of speaking: “it seems to me.”  they
make me hate things that are likely, when they would impose them upon me
as infallible.  i [[love]] these words which mollify and moderate the
temerity of our propositions: “peradventure; in some sort; some; ‘tis
said, i [[think]],” and the like: and had i been set to train up [[children]] i
had put this way of answering into their mouths, inquiring and not
resolving: “what does this mean?  i [[understand]] it not; it may be: is it
true?” so that they should rather have retained the form of pupils at
threescore years old than to go out doctors, as they do, at ten.  whoever
will be cured of ignorance must confess it.

iris is the [[daughter]] of thaumas;

     [“that is, of admiration.  she (iris, the rainbow) is beautiful, and
     for that [[reason]], because she has a face to be admired, she is said
     to have been the [[daughter]] of thamus.”
      --cicero, de nat. deor., iii. 20.]

admiration is the foundation of all [[philosophy]], inquisition the [[progress]],
ignorance the end.  but there is a sort of ignorance, [[strong]] and
generous, that yields nothing in [[honour]] and [[courage]] to [[knowledge]]; an
ignorance which to conceive requires no less [[knowledge]] than to conceive
knowledge itself.  i [[read]] in my younger years a [[trial]] that corras,

     [a celebrated calvinist lawyer, born at toulouse; 1513, and
     assassinated there, 4th october 1572.]

a councillor of toulouse, printed, of a [[strange]] incident, of two [[men]] who
presented themselves the one for the other.  i [[remember]] (and i hardly
remember anything else) that he seemed to have rendered the imposture of
him whom he judged to be guilty, so wonderful and so far exceeding both
our [[knowledge]] and his own, who was the [[judge]], that i [[thought]] it a very
bold sentence that condemned him to be [[hanged]].  let us have some form of
decree that says, “the court understands nothing of the matter” more
freely and ingenuously than the areopagites did, who, finding themselves
perplexed with a cause they could not unravel, ordered the parties to
appear again after a hundred years.

the witches of my neighbourhood run the hazard of their lives [[life]] upon the
report of every new author who seeks to give [[body]] to their dreams [[dream]].  to
accommodate the examples [[example]] that holy writ gives us of such things, most
certain and irrefragable examples [[example]], and to tie them to our [[modern]] events,
seeing that we neither see the causes nor the means, will require another
sort-of wit than ours.  it, peradventure, only appertains to that sole
all-potent testimony to tell us.  “this is, and that is, and not that
other.”  [[god]] ought to be believed; and certainly with very [[good]] [[reason]];
but not one amongst us for all that who is astonished at his own
narration (and he must of necessity be astonished if he be not out of his
wits), whether he employ it about other [[men’s]] affairs or against himself.

i am plain and heavy, and stick to the solid and the probable, avoiding
those ancient reproaches:

          “majorem fidem homines adhibent iis, quae non intelligunt;
          --cupidine humani ingenii libentius obscura creduntur.”

     [“men are most apt to [[believe]] what they least [[understand]]: and from
     the acquisitiveness of the [[human]] [[intellect]], obscure things are more
     easily credited.” the second sentence is from tacitus, hist. 1. 22.]

i see very well that [[men]] get angry, and that i am forbidden to [[doubt]] upon
pain of execrable injuries; a new way of persuading!  thank [[god]], i am not
to be cuffed into [[belief]].  let them be angry with those who accuse their
opinion of falsity; i only accuse it of difficulty and boldness, and
condemn the opposite affirmation equally, if not so imperiously, with
them.  he who will establish this proposition by [[authority]] and huffing
discovers his [[reason]] to be very [[weak]].  for a verbal and scholastic
altercation let them have as much appearance as their contradictors;

               “videantur sane, non affirmentur modo;”

     [“they may indeed appear to be; let them not be affirmed (let them
     [[state]] the probabilities, but not affirm.)”
      --cicero, acad., n. 27.]

but in the real consequence they draw from it these have much the
advantage.  to kill [[men]], a clear and [[strong]] [[light]] is required, and our
life is too real and essential to warrant these supernatural and
fantastic accidents.

as to drugs and poisons, i throw them out of my count, as being the worst
sort of homicides: yet even in this, ‘tis said, that [[men]] are not always
to rely upon the personal confessions of these [[people]]; for they have
sometimes been known to accuse themselves of the murder of persons [[person]] who
have afterwards been found living and well.  in these other extravagant
accusations, i should be apt to say, that it is sufficient a [[man]], what
recommendation soever he may have, be believed as to [[human]] things; but of
what is beyond his conception, and of supernatural effect, he ought then
only to be believed when authorised by a supernatural approbation.  the
privilege it has pleased almighty [[god]] to give to some of our witnesses,
ought not to be lightly communicated and made cheap.  i have my ears
battered with a thousand such tales as these: “three persons [[person]] saw him such
a day in the east three, the next day in the west: at such an hour, in
such a place, and in such habit”; assuredly i should not [[believe]] it
myself.  how much more [[natural]] and likely do i find it that two men
should [[lie]] than that one [[man]] in twelve hours’ [[time]] should fly with the
wind from east to west?  how much more [[natural]] that our understanding
should be carried from its place by the volubility of our disordered
minds, than that one of us should be carried by a [[strange]] spirit upon a
broomstaff, flesh and bones as we are, up the shaft of a chimney?  let
not us seek illusions from without and unknown, we who are perpetually
agitated with illusions domestic and our own.  methinks one is pardonable
in disbelieving a miracle, at least, at all events where one can elude
its verification as such, by means not miraculous; and i am of st.
augustine’s [[opinion]], that, “‘tis [[better]] to lean towards [[doubt]] than
assurance, in things hard to prove and dangerous to [[believe]].”

‘tis now some years ago that i travelled through the territories of a
sovereign [[prince]], who, in my favour, and to abate my incredulity, did me
the [[honour]] to let me see, in his own presence, and in a private place,
ten or twelve prisoners [[prisoner]] of this [[kind]], and amongst others, an old woman,
a real witch in foulness and deformity, who long had been famous in that
profession.  i saw both proofs and [[free]] confessions, and i [[know]] not what
insensible mark upon the miserable creature: i examined and talked with
her and the rest as much and as long as i would, and gave the [[best]] and
soundest attention i could, and i am not a [[man]] to suffer my [[judgment]] to
be made captive by prepossession.  in the end, and in all [[conscience]], i
should rather have prescribed them hellebore than hemlock;

     “captisque res magis mentibus, quam consceleratis similis visa;”

     [“the thing was rather to be attributed to madness, than malice.”
      (“the thing seemed to resemble minds [[mind]] possessed rather than guilty.”)
     --livy, viii, 18.]

justice has its corrections proper for such maladies.  as to the
oppositions and arguments that worthy [[men]] have made to me, both there,
and often in other places, i have met with none that have convinced me,
and that have not admitted a more likely solution than their conclusions.
it is true, indeed, that the proofs and reasons [[reason]] that are founded upon
experience and [[fact]], i do not go about to untie, neither have they any
end; i often cut them, as alexander did the gordian knot.  after all,
‘tis setting a man’s conjectures at a very high price upon them to cause
a [[man]] to be roasted alive.

we are told by several examples [[example]], as praestantius of his [[father]], that
being more profoundly, asleep than [[men]] usually are, he fancied himself
to be a mare, and that he served the soldiers for a sumpter; and what
he fancied himself to be, he really proved.  if sorcerers [[dream]] so
materially; if dreams [[dream]] can sometimes so incorporate themselves with
effects, still i cannot [[believe]] that therefore our will should be
accountable to [[justice]]; which i say as one who am neither [[judge]] nor privy
councillor, and who [[think]] myself by many degrees [[degree]] unworthy so to be, but a
man of the [[common]] sort, born and avowed to the [[obedience]] of the public
reason, both in its words and acts.  he who should record my idle talk as
being to the prejudice of the pettiest [[law]], [[opinion]], or custom of his
parish, would do himself a [[great]] deal of [[wrong]], and me much more; for, in
what i say, i warrant no other certainty, but that ‘tis what i had then
in my [[thought]], a tumultuous and wavering [[thought]].  all i say is by way of
discourse, and nothing by way of [[advice]]:

          “nec me pudet, ut istos fateri nescire, quod nesciam;”

     [“neither am i ashamed, as they are, to confess my ignorance of what
     i do not [[know]].”--cicero, tusc. quaes., i. 25.]

i should not speak so boldly, if it were my due to be believed; and so i
told a [[great]] [[man]], who complained of the tartness and contentiousness of
my exhortations.  perceiving you to be ready and prepared on one part, i
propose to you the other, with all the diligence and [[care]] i can, to clear
your [[judgment]], not to compel it.  [[god]] has your hearts [[heart]] in his hands, and
will furnish you with the means of [[choice]].  i am not so presumptuous even
as to [[desire]] that my opinions [[opinion]] should bias you--in a thing of so great
importance: my [[fortune]] has not trained them up to so potent and elevated
conclusions.  truly, i have not only a [[great]] many humours [[humour]], but also a
great many opinions [[opinion]], that i would endeavour to make my [[son]] dislike, if i
had one.  what, if the truest are not always the most commodious to [[man]],
being of so wild a composition?

whether it be to the [[purpose]] or not, tis no [[great]] matter: ‘tis a common
proverb in [[italy]], that he knows [[know]] not [[venus]] in her [[perfect]] sweetness who
has never lain with a lame mistress.  [[fortune]], or some particular
incident, long ago put this saying into the mouths of the [[people]]; and the
same is said of [[men]] as well as of [[women]]; for the queen of the amazons
answered the scythian who courted her to [[love]], “lame [[men]] perform [[best]].”
 in this feminine [[republic]], to evade the dominion of the males, they
lamed them in their infancy--arms, legs, and other members that gave them
advantage over them, and only made use of them in that wherein we, in
these parts of the [[world]], make use of them.  i should have been apt to
think; that the shuffling pace of the lame mistress added some new
pleasure to the [[work]], and some extraordinary titillation to those who
were at the [[sport]]; but i have lately learnt that ancient [[philosophy]] has
itself determined it, which says that the legs and thighs of lame [[women]],
not receiving, by [[reason]] of their imperfection, their due aliment, it
falls out that the genital parts above are fuller and [[better]] supplied and
much more vigorous; or else that this defect, hindering exercise, they
who are troubled with it less dissipate their [[strength]], and come more
entire to the sports [[sport]] of [[venus]]; which also is the [[reason]] why the greeks
decried the women-weavers as being more hot than other [[women]] by [[reason]] of
their sedentary [[trade]], which they carry on without any [[great]] exercise of
the [[body]].  what is it we may not [[reason]] of at this rate?  i might also
say of these, that the jaggling about whilst so sitting at [[work]], rouses
and provokes their [[desire]], as the swinging and jolting of coaches does
that of our ladies [[lady]].

do not these examples [[example]] serve to make [[good]] what i said at first: that our
reasons often anticipate the effect, and have so infinite an extent of
jurisdiction that they [[judge]] and exercise themselves even on inanity
itself and non-existency?  besides the flexibility of our invention to
forge reasons [[reason]] of all sorts of dreams [[dream]], our [[imagination]] is equally facile
to receive impressions of falsity by very frivolous appearances; for, by
the sole [[authority]] of the ancient and [[common]] use of this proverb, i have
formerly made myself [[believe]] that i have had more [[pleasure]] in a woman by
reason she was not straight, and accordingly reckoned that deformity
amongst her graces.

torquato tasso, in the comparison he makes betwixt [[france]] and [[italy]],
says that he has observed that our legs are generally smaller than those
of the italian gentlemen, and attributes the cause of it to our being
continually on horseback; which is the very same cause from which
suetonius draws a quite opposite conclusion; for he says, on the
contrary, that germanicus had made his legs bigger by the continuation of
the same exercise.

nothing is so supple and erratic as our understanding; it is the shoe of
theramenes, fit for all feet.  it is double and diverse, and the matters
are double and diverse too.  “give me a drachm of silver,” said a cynic
philosopher to antigonus.  “that is not a [[present]] befitting a [[king]],”
 replied he.  “give me then a talent,” said the other.  “that is not a
present befitting a cynic.”

              “seu plures calor ille vias et caeca relaxat
               spiramenta, novas veniat qua succus in herbas
               seu durat magis, et venas astringit hiantes;
               ne tenues pluviae, rapidive potentia colic
               acrior, aut boreae penetrabile frigus adurat.”

     [“whether the heat opens more passages and secret pores through
     which the sap may be derived into the new-born herbs; or whether it
     rather hardens and binds the gaping veins that the small showers and
     keen influence of the [[violent]] sun or penetrating cold of boreas may
     not hurt them.”--virg., georg., i. 89.]

                    “ogni medaglia ha il suo rovescio.”

          [“every medal has its reverse.”--italian proverb.]

this is the [[reason]] why clitomachus said of old that carneades had outdone
the labours [[labour]] of hercules, in having eradicated [[consent]] from [[men]], that is
to say, [[opinion]] and the [[courage]] of judging.  this so vigorous fancy of
carneades sprang, in my [[opinion]], anciently from the impudence of those
who made profession of [[knowledge]] and their immeasurable self-conceit.
aesop was set to sale with two other slaves [[slave]]; the buyer [[asked]] the first of
these what he could do; he, to enhance his own value, promised mountains
and marvels, saying he could do this and that, and i [[know]] not what; the
second said as much of himself or more: when it came to aesop’s turn, and
that he was also [[asked]] what he could do; “nothing,” said he, “for these
two have taken up all before me; they [[know]] everything.”  so has it
happened in the school of [[philosophy]]: the [[pride]] of those who attributed
the capacity of all things to the [[human]] [[mind]] created in others, out of
despite and emulation, this [[opinion]], that it is capable of nothing: the
one maintain the same extreme in ignorance that the others do in
knowledge; to make it undeniably manifest that [[man]] is immoderate
throughout, and can never stop but of necessity and the want of ability
to proceed further.




chapter xii

of physiognomy

almost all the opinions [[opinion]] we have are taken on [[authority]] and trust; and
‘tis not amiss; we could not choose worse than by ourselves in so [[weak]] an
age.  that image of socrates’ discourses, which his [[friends]] have
transmitted to us, we approve upon no other account than a reverence to
public sanction: ‘tis not according to our own [[knowledge]]; they are not
after our way; if anything of the [[kind]] should spring up now, few men
would value them.  we discern no graces that are not pointed and puffed
out and inflated by art [[arts]]; such as glide on in their own purity and
simplicity easily escape so gross a sight as ours; they have a delicate
and concealed [[beauty]], such as requires a clear and purified sight to
discover its secret [[light]].  is not simplicity, as we take it,
cousin-german to folly and a quality of reproach?  [[socrates]] makes his
soul move a [[natural]] and [[common]] motion: a peasant said this; a woman said
that; he has never anybody in his mouth but carters, joiners, cobblers,
and masons; his are inductions and similitudes drawn from the most common
and known actions of [[men]]; every one understands him.  we should never
have recognised the nobility and splendour of his admirable conceptions
under so mean a form; we, who [[think]] all things low and flat that are not
elevated, by learned doctrine, and who discern no riches [[rich]] but in pomp and
show.  this [[world]] of ours is only formed for ostentation: [[men]] are only
puffed up with wind, and are bandied to and fro like tennis-balls.  he
proposed to himself no [[vain]] and idle fancies; his design was to furnish
us with precepts and things that more really and fitly serve to the use
of [[life]];

                       “servare modum, finemque tenere,
                    naturamque sequi.”

               [“to keep a just mean, to observe a just limit,
               and to [[follow]] [[nature]].”--lucan, ii. 381.]

he was also always one and the same, and raised himself, not by starts
but by [[complexion]], to the highest pitch of vigour; or, to say [[better]],
mounted not at all, but rather brought down, reduced, and subjected all
asperities and difficulties to his original and [[natural]] condition; for in
cato ‘tis most manifest that ‘tis a procedure extended far beyond the
common ways of [[men]]: in the brave exploits of his [[life]], and in his [[death]],
we find him always mounted upon the [[great]] horse; whereas the other ever
creeps upon the ground, and with a gentle and ordinary pace, treats of
the most useful matters, and bears himself, both at his [[death]] and in the
rudest difficulties that could [[present]] themselves, in the ordinary way of
human [[life]].

it has fallen out well that the [[man]] most worthy to be known and to be
presented to the [[world]] for [[example]] should be he of whom we have the most
certain [[knowledge]]; he has been pried into by the most clear-sighted men
that ever were; the testimonies we have of him are admirable both in
fidelity and fulness.  ‘tis a [[great]] thing that he was able so to order
the pure imaginations [[imagination]] of a child, that, without altering or wresting
them, he thereby produced the most beautiful effects of our [[soul]]: he
presents it neither elevated nor [[rich]]; he only represents it sound, but
assuredly with a brisk and full health.  by these [[common]] and natural
springs, by these ordinary and popular fancies, without being moved or
put out, he set up not only the most regular, but the most high and
vigorous beliefs, actions, and manners that ever were.  ‘tis he who
brought again from [[heaven]], where she lost her [[time]], [[human]] [[wisdom]], to
restore her to [[man]] with whom her most just and [[greatest]] [[business]] lies [[lie]].
see him plead before his judges [[judge]]; observe by what reasons [[reason]] he rouses his
courage to the hazards of [[war]]; with what arguments he fortifies his
patience against calumny, [[tyranny]], [[death]], and the perverseness of his
wife: you will find nothing in all this borrowed from [[arts]] and sciences [[science]]:
the simplest may there discover their own means and [[strength]]; ‘tis not
possible more to retire or to creep more low.  he has done [[human]] [[nature]] a
great [[kindness]] in showing it how much it can do of itself.

we are all of us richer than we [[think]] we are; but we are taught to borrow
and to beg, and brought up more to make use of what is another’s than of
our own.  [[man]] can in nothing fix himself to his actual necessity: of
pleasure, [[wealth]], and [[power]], he grasps at more than he can hold; his
greediness is incapable of moderation.  and i find that in curiosity of
knowing he is the same; he cuts himself out more [[work]] than he can do, and
more than he needs to do: extending the utility of [[knowledge]] to the full
of its matter:

     “ut omnium rerum, sic litterarum quoque, intemperantia laboramus.”

     [“we carry intemperance into the study of literature, as well as
     into everything else.”--seneca, ep., 106.]

and tacitus had [[reason]] to commend the [[mother]] of agricola for having
restrained her [[son]] in his too [[violent]] appetite for learning.

tis a [[good]], if duly considered, which has in it, as the other goods [[good]] of
men have, a [[great]] deal of vanity and weakness, proper and [[natural]] to
itself, and that costs very dear.  its acquisition is far more hazardous
than that of all other meat or drink; for, as to other things, what we
have bought we carry [[home]] in some vessel, and there have full leisure to
examine our purchase, how much we shall [[eat]] or drink of it, and when: but
sciences we can, at the very first, stow into no other vessel than the
soul; we swallow them in buying, and return from the market, either
already infected or amended: there are some that only burden and
overcharge the stomach, instead of nourishing; and, moreover, some that,
under colour of curing, poison us.  i have been pleased, in places where
i have been, to see [[men]] in devotion vow ignorance as well as chastity,
poverty, and penitence: ‘tis also a gelding of our unruly appetites, to
blunt this cupidity that spurs us on to the study of books [[book]], and to
deprive the [[soul]] of this voluptuous complacency that tickles us with the
opinion of [[knowledge]]: and ‘tis plenarily to accomplish the vow of
poverty, to add unto it that of the [[mind]].  we need little doctrine to
live at our ease; and [[socrates]] teaches [[teach]] us that this is in us, and the way
how to find it, and the manner how to use it: all our sufficiency which
exceeds the [[natural]] is well-nigh superfluous and [[vain]]: ‘tis much if it
does not rather burden and cumber us than do us [[good]]:

               “paucis opus est literis ad mentem bonam:”

          [“little learning is needed to form a sound [[mind]].”
           --seneca, ep., 106.]

‘tis a feverish excess of the [[mind]]; a tempestuous and unquiet instrument.
do but recollect yourself, and you will find in yourself natural
arguments against [[death]], true, and the fittest to serve you in [[time]] of
necessity: ‘tis they that make a peasant, and whole nations, [[die]] with as
much firmness as a philosopher.  should i have died less cheerfully
before i had [[read]] cicero’s tusculan quastiones?  i [[believe]] not; and when
i find myself at the [[best]], i perceive that my tongue is enriched indeed,
but my [[courage]] little or nothing elevated by them; that is just as nature
framed it at first, and defends itself against the conflict only after a
natural and ordinary way.  books [[book]] have not so much served me for
instruction as exercise.  what if [[knowledge]], trying to arm us with new
defences against [[natural]] inconveniences, has more imprinted in our
fancies their weight and greatness, than her reasons [[reason]] and subtleties to
secure us from them?  they are subtleties, indeed, with which she often
alarms us to little [[purpose]].  do but observe how many slight and
frivolous, and, if nearly examined, incorporeal arguments, the closest
and wisest authors scatter about one [[good]] one: they are but verbal quirks
and fallacies to amuse and gull us: but forasmuch as it may be with some
profit, i will sift them no further; many of that sort are here and there
dispersed up and down this [[book]], either borrowed or by imitation.
therefore one ought to take a little heed not to call that [[force]] which is
only a pretty knack of writing, and that solid which is only sharp, or
that [[good]] which is only fine:

               “quae magis gustata quam potata, delectant,”

          [“which more delight in the tasting than in being drunk.”
           --cicero, tusc. quaes., v. 5.]

everything that pleases does not nourish:

               “ubi non ingenii, sed animi negotium agitur.”

     [“where the [[question]] is not about the wit, but about the [[soul]].”
      --seneca, ep., 75.]

to see the trouble that seneca gives himself to fortify himself against
death; to see him so sweat and pant to harden and encourage himself, and
bustle so long upon this perch, would have lessened his [[reputation]] with
me, had he not very bravely held himself at the [[last]].  his so ardent and
frequent agitations discover that he was in himself impetuous and
passionate,

          “magnus animus remissius loquitur, et securius .  .  .
          non est alius ingenio, alius ammo color;”

     [“a [[great]] [[courage]] speaks more calmly and more securely.  there is
     not one [[complexion]] for the wit and another for the [[mind]].”
      --seneca, ep. 114, 115]

he must be convinced at his own expense; and he in some sort discovers
that he was hard pressed by his [[enemy]].  plutarch’s way, by how much it is
more disdainful and farther stretched, is, in my [[opinion]], so much more
manly and persuasive: and i am apt to [[believe]] that his [[soul]] had more
assured and more regular motions.  the one more sharp, pricks and makes
us start, and more touches the [[soul]]; the other more constantly solid,
forms, establishes, and supports us, and more touches the understanding.
that ravishes the [[judgment]], this wins it.  i have likewise seen other
writings, yet more reverenced than these, that in the representation of
the conflict they maintain against the temptations of the flesh, paint
them, so sharp, so powerful and invincible, that we ourselves, who are of
the [[common]] herd, are as much to wonder at the strangeness and unknown
force of their temptation, as at the resisting it.

to what end do we so arm ourselves with this harness of [[science]]?  let us
look down upon the [[poor]] [[people]] that we see scattered upon the face of the
earth, prone and intent upon their [[business]], that neither [[know]] aristotle
nor cato, [[example]] nor precept; from these [[nature]] every day extracts
effects of constancy and patience, more pure and manly than those we so
inquisitively study in the schools: how many do i ordinarily see who
slight [[poverty]]?  how many who [[desire]] to [[die]], or who [[die]] without alarm or
regret?  he who is now digging in my garden, has this morning buried his
father or his [[son]].  the very names by which they call diseases sweeten
and mollify the sharpness of them: the phthisic is with them no more than
a cough, dysentery but a looseness, the pleurisy but a stitch; and, as
they gently name them, so they patiently endure them; they are very great
and grievous indeed when they hinder their ordinary [[labour]]; they never
keep their beds but to [[die]]:

          “simplex illa et aperta virtus in obscuram et solertem
          scientiam versa est.”

     [“that overt and simple [[virtue]] is converted into an obscure and
     subtle [[science]].”--seneca, ep., 95.]

i was writing this about the [[time]] when a [[great]] load of our intestine
troubles for several months lay with all its weight upon me; i had the
enemy at my door on one side, and the freebooters, worse enemies [[enemy]], on the
other,

               “non armis, sed vitiis, certatur;”

     [“the [[fight]] is not with arms, but with vices [[vice]].”--seneca, ep. 95.]

and underwent all sorts of [[military]] injuries at once:

         “hostis adest dextra laevaque a parte timendus.
          vicinoque malo terret utrumque latus.”

     [“right and left a formidable [[enemy]] is to be feared, and threatens
     me on both sides with impending danger.”--ovid, de ponto, i. 3, 57.]

a monstrous war!  other wars [[war]] are bent against strangers, this against
itself, destroying itself with its own poison.  it is of so malignant and
ruinous a [[nature]], that it ruins itself with the rest; and with its own
rage mangles and tears itself to pieces.  we more often see it dissolve
of itself than through scarcity of any necessary thing or by [[force]] of the
enemy.  all discipline evades it; it comes to compose sedition, and is
itself full of it; would chastise disobedience, and itself is the
example; and, employed for the defence of the laws [[law]], rebels against its
own.  what a condition are we in!  our physic makes us sick!

                    “nostre mal s’empoisonne
                    du secours qu’on luy donne.”

               “exuperat magis, aegrescitque medendo.”

     [“our disease is poisoned with its very remedies”--aenead, xii. 46.]

               “omnia fanda, nefanda, malo permista furore,
               justificam nobis mentem avertere deorum.”

     [“right and [[wrong]], all shuffled together in this wicked fury, have
     deprived us of the gods’ protection.”
      --catullus, de nuptiis pelei et thetidos, v. 405.]

in the beginning of these popular maladies, one may distinguish the sound
from the sick; but when they come to continue, as ours have done, the
whole [[body]] is then infected from head to foot; no part is [[free]] from
corruption, for there is no air that [[men]] so greedily draw in that
diffuses itself so soon and that penetrates so deep as that of licence.
our armies [[army]] only subsist and are kept together by the cement of
foreigners; for of frenchmen there is now no constant and regular [[army]] to
be made.  what a shame it is! there is no longer any discipline but what
we see in the mercenary soldiers.  as to ourselves, our conduct is at
discretion, and that not of the [[chief]], but every one at his own.  the
general has a harder game to play within than he has without; he it is
who has to [[follow]], to court the soldiers, to give way to them; he alone
has to obey: all the rest if disolution and [[free]] licence.  it pleases me
to observe how much pusillanimity and cowardice there is in [[ambition]]; by
how abject and servile ways it must arrive at its end; but it displeases
me to see [[good]] and generous natures [[nature]], and that are capable of [[justice]],
every day corrupted in the management and command of this confusion.
long toleration begets habit; habit, [[consent]] and imitation.  we had
ill-formed souls [[soul]] enough, without spoiling those that were generous and
good; so that, if we hold on, there will scarcely remain any with whom to
intrust the health of this [[state]] of ours, in case [[fortune]] [[chance]] to
restore it:

              “hunc saltem everso juvenem succurrere seclo,
               ne prohibete.”

     [“forbid not, at least, that this [[young]] [[man]] repair this ruined [[age]].”
      --virgil, georg., i.  500.  montaigne probably refers to henry, king
     of navarre, afterwards henry iv.]

what has become of the old precept, “that soldiers ought more to fear
their [[chief]] than the enemy”?--[valerius maximus, ext. 2.]--and of that
wonderful [[example]], that an orchard being enclosed within the precincts of
a camp of the roman [[army]], was seen at their dislodgment the next day in
the same condition, not an apple, though ripe and delicious, being pulled
off, but all left to the possessor?  i could [[wish]] that our [[youth]], instead
of the [[time]] they spend in less fruitful travels and less honourable
employments, would bestow one half of that [[time]] in being an eye-witness
of naval exploits, under some [[good]] captain of rhodes, and the other half
in observing the discipline of the turkish armies [[army]]; for they have many
differences and advantages over ours; one of these is, that our soldiers
become more licentious in expeditions, theirs more temperate and
circumspect; for the thefts and insolencies committed upon the common
people, which are only punished with a cudgel in [[peace]], are [[capital]] in
war; for an egg taken by a turkish soldier without paying for it, fifty
blows with a stick is the fixed rate; for anything else, of what sort or
how trivial soever, not necessary to nourishment, they are presently
impaled or beheaded without [[mercy]].  i am astonished, in the [[history]] of
selim, the most cruel conqueror that ever was, to see that when he
subdued [[egypt]], the beautiful gardens about damascus being all open, and
in a conquered [[land]], and his [[army]] encamped upon the very place, should be
left untouched by the hands of the soldiers, by [[reason]] they had not
received the signal of pillage.

but is there any disease in a [[government]] that it is worth while to physic
with such a mortal drug?--[i.e.  as civil [[war]].]--no, said favonius, not
even the [[tyrannical]] usurpation of a commonwealth.  [[plato]], likewise, will
not [[consent]] that a [[man]] should violate the [[peace]] of his [[country]] in order
to cure it, and by no means approves of a reformation that disturbs and
hazards all, and that is to be purchased at the price of the citizens’
blood and ruin; determining it to be the [[duty]] of a [[good]] patriot in such a
case to let it alone, and only to [[pray]] to [[god]] for his extraordinary
assistance: and he seems to be angry with his [[great]] friend dion, for
having proceeded somewhat after another manner.  i was a platonist in
this point before i knew there had ever been such a [[man]] as [[plato]] in the
world.  and if this [[person]] ought absolutely to be rejected from our
society (he who by the sincerity of his [[conscience]] merited from the
divine favour to penetrate so far into the [[christian]] [[light]], through the
universal darkness wherein the [[world]] was involved in his time), i do not
think it becomes us to suffer ourselves to be instructed by a heathen,
how [[great]] an impiety it is not to expect from [[god]] any relief simply his
own and without our co-operation.  i often [[doubt]], whether amongst so many
men as meddle in such affairs, there is not to be found some one of so
weak understanding as to have been really persuaded that he went towards
reformation by the worst of deformations; and advanced towards salvation
by the most express causes that we have of most assured damnation; that
by overthrowing [[government]], the magistracy, and the laws [[law]], in whose
protection [[god]] has placed him, by dismembering his [[good]] [[mother]], and
giving her limbs to be mangled by her old enemies [[enemy]], filling fraternal
hearts with parricidal hatreds, calling devils [[devil]] and furies to his aid, he
can assist the most holy sweetness and [[justice]] of the [[divine]] [[law]].
ambition, avarice, [[cruelty]], and [[revenge]] have not sufficient natural
impetuosity of their own; let us bait them with the glorious titles of
justice and devotion.  there cannot a worse [[state]] of things be imagined
than where wickedness comes to be legitimate, and assumes, with the
magistrates’ permission, the cloak of [[virtue]]:

          “nihil in speciem fallacius, quam prava religio,
          ubi deorum numen prxtenditur sceleribus.”

     [“nothing has a more deceiving face than false [[religion]], where the
     divinity of the gods is obscured by crimes.”--livy, xxxix. 16.]

the extremest sort of [[injustice]], according to [[plato]],  is where that which
is [[unjust]] should be reputed for just.

the [[common]] [[people]] then [[suffered]] very much, and not [[present]] damage only:

                              “undique totis
                    usque adeo turbatur agris,”

          [“such [[great]] disorders overtake our fields on every side.”
           --virgil, eclog., i. ii.]

but future too; the living were to suffer, and so were they who were yet
unborn; they stript them, and consequently myself, even of [[hope]], taking
from them all they had laid up in store to [[live]] on for many years:

         “quae nequeunt secum ferre aut abducere, perdunt;
          et cremat insontes turba scelesta casas .  .  .
          muris nulla fides, squalent populatibus agri.”

     [“what they cannot bear away, they spoil; and the wicked mob burn
     harmless houses; walls cannot secure their masters, and the fields
     are squalid with devastation.”
      --ovid, trist., iii. 10, 35; claudianus, in eutyop., i. 244.]

besides this shock, i [[suffered]] others: i underwent the inconveniences
that moderation brings along with it in such a disease: i was robbed on
all hands; to the ghibelline i was a guelph, and to the guelph a
ghibelline; one of my poets expresses this very well, but i [[know]] not
where it is.

     [“so tories called me whig, and whigs a tory.”--pope, after horace.]

the situation of my house, and my friendliness with my neighbours,
presented me with one face; my [[life]] and my actions with another.  they
did not lay formal accusations to my charge, for they had no foundation
for so doing; i never hide my head from the laws [[law]], and whoever would have
questioned me, would have done himself a greater prejudice than me; they
were only mute suspicions that were whispered about, which never want
appearance in so confused a mixture, no more than envious or idle heads.
i commonly myself lend a hand to injurious presumptions that fortune
scatters abroad against me, by a way i have ever had of evading to
justify, excuse, or explain myself; conceiving that it were to compromise
my [[conscience]] to plead in its behalf:

               “perspicuitas enim argumentatione elevatur;”

     [“for perspicuity is lessened by argument.”
      (“the clearness of a cause is clouded by argumentation.”)
     --cicero, de nat.  deor., iii.  4.]

and, as if every one saw as clearly into me as i do myself, instead of
retiring from an accusation, i step up to meet it, and rather give it
some [[kind]] of colour by an ironical and scoffing [[confession]], if i do not
sit totally mute, as of a thing not worth my [[answer]].  but such as look
upon this [[kind]] of behaviour of mine as too haughty a confidence, have as
little [[kindness]] for me as they who interpret the weakness of an
indefensible cause; namely, the [[great]] folks, towards whom want of
submission is the [[great]] [[fault]], harsh towards all [[justice]] that knows [[know]] and
feels itself, and is not submissive humble, and suppliant; i have often
knocked my head against this pillar.  so it is that at what then befell
me, an ambitious [[man]] would have [[hanged]] himself, and a covetous [[man]] would
have done the same.  i have no manner of [[care]] of getting;

         “si mihi, quod nunc est, etiam minus; et mihi vivam
          quod superest aevi, si quid superesse volent dii:”

     [“if i may have what i now own, or even less, and may [[live]] for
     myself what of [[life]] remains, if the gods grant me remaining years.”
      --horace, ep., i. 18, 107.]

but the losses that befall me by the injury of others, whether by theft
or [[violence]], go almost as near my [[heart]] as they would to that of the most
avaricious [[man]].  the offence troubles me, without comparison, more than
the loss.  a thousand several sorts of mischiefs fell upon me in the neck
of one another; i could more cheerfully have borne them all at once.

i was already considering to whom, amongst my [[friends]], i might commit a
necessitous and discredited old [[age]]; and having turned my [[eyes]] quite
round, i found myself bare.  to let one’s [[self]] fall plump down, and from
so [[great]] a height, it ought to be in the arms of a solid, vigorous, and
fortunate [[friendship]]: these are very rare, if there be any.  at [[last]], i
saw that it was safest for me to trust to myself in my necessity; and if
it should so fall out, that i should be but upon cold terms in fortune’s
favour, i should so much the more pressingly recommend me to my own, and
attach myself and look to myself all the more closely.  [[men]] on all
occasions throw themselves upon [[foreign]] assistance to spare their own,
which is alone [[certain]] and sufficient to him who knows [[know]] how therewith to
arm himself.  every one runs elsewhere, and to the future, forasmuch as
no one is arrived at himself.  and i was satisfied that they were
profitable inconveniences; forasmuch as, first, ill scholars are to be
admonished with the rod, when [[reason]] will not do, as a crooked piece of
wood is by [[fire]] and straining reduced to straightness.  i have a great
while preached to myself to stick close to my own concerns, and separate
myself from the affairs of others; yet i am still turning my [[eyes]] aside.
a bow, a favourable word, a [[kind]] look from a [[great]] [[person]] tempts me; of
which [[god]] knows [[know]] if there is scarcity in these days, and what they
signify.  i, moreover, without wrinkling my forehead, hearken to the
persuasions offered me, to draw me into the marketplace, and so gently
refuse, as if i were half willing to be overcome.  now for so indocile a
spirit blows are required; this vessel which thus chops and cleaves, and
is ready to fall one piece from another, must have the hoops forced down
with [[good]] sound strokes of a mallet.  secondly, that this accident served
me for exercise to prepare me for worse, if i, who both by the benefit of
fortune, and by the condition of my manners, hoped to be among the [[last]],
should happen to be one of the first assailed by this storm; instructing
myself betimes to constrain my [[life]], and fit it for a new [[state]].  the
true [[liberty]] is to be able to do what a [[man]] will with himself:

          “potentissimus est, qui se habet in potestate.”

     [“he is most potent who is master of himself.”--seneca, ep., 94.]

in an ordinary and quiet [[time]], a [[man]] prepares himself for moderate and
common accidents; but in the confusion wherein we have been for these
thirty years, every frenchman, whether personal or in general, sees
himself every hour upon the point of the total ruin and overthrow of his
fortune: by so much the more ought he to have his [[courage]] supplied with
the strongest and most vigorous provisions.  let us thank [[fortune]], that
has not made us [[live]] in an effeminate, idle, and languishing [[age]]; some
who could never have been so by other means will be made famous by their
misfortunes.  as i seldom [[read]] in histories [[history]] the confusions of other
states without regret that i was not [[present]], the [[better]] to consider
them, so does my curiosity make me in some sort please myself in seeing
with my own [[eyes]] this notable spectacle of our [[public]] [[death]], its form and
symptoms; and since i cannot hinder it, i am content to have been
destined to be [[present]] therein, and thereby to instruct myself.  so do
we eagerly covet to see, though but in shadow and the fables of theatres,
the pomp of tragic representations of [[human]] [[fortune]]; ‘tis not without
compassion at what we hear, but we please ourselves in rousing our
displeasure, by the rarity of these pitiable events.  nothing tickles
that does not pinch.  and [[good]] historians skip over, as stagnant water
and [[dead]] sea, calm narrations, to return to seditions, to wars [[war]], to which
they [[know]] that we invite them.

i [[question]] whether i can decently confess with how small a [[sacrifice]] of
its repose and tranquillity i have passed over above the one half of my
life amid the ruin of my [[country]].  i lend myself my patience somewhat too
cheap, in accidents that do not privately assail me; and do not so much
regard what they take from me, as what remains safe, both within and
without.  there is comfort in evading, one while this, another while
that, of the evils [[evil]] that are levelled at ourselves too, at [[last]], but at
present hurt others only about us; as also, that in matters of public
interest, the more universally my affection is dispersed, the weaker it
is: to which may be added, that it is half true:

               “tantum ex publicis malis sentimus,
               quantum ad privatas res pertinet;”

     [“we are only so far sensible of [[public]] evils [[evil]] as they [[respect]] our
     private affairs.”--livy, xxx. 44.]

and that the health from which we fell was so ill, that itself relieves
the regret we should have for it.  it was health, but only in comparison
with the sickness that has succeeded it: we are not fallen from any great
height; the [[corruption]] and brigandage which are in [[dignity]] and office
seem to me the least supportable: we are less injuriously rifled in a
wood than in a place of security.  it was an universal juncture of
particular members, each corrupted by emulation of the others, and most
of them with old ulcers, that neither received nor required any cure.
this convulsion, therefore, really more animated than pressed me, by the
assistance of my [[conscience]], which was not only at [[peace]] within itself,
but elevated, and i did not find any [[reason]] to [[complain]] of myself.  also,
as [[god]] never sends evils [[evil]], any more than goods [[good]], absolutely pure to [[men]],
my health continued at that [[time]] more than usually [[good]]; and, as i can
do nothing without it, there are few things that i cannot do with it.
it afforded me means to rouse up all my faculties, and to lay my hand
before the wound that would else, peradventure, have gone farther; and i
experienced, in my patience, that i had some stand against [[fortune]], and
that it must be a [[great]] shock could throw me out of the saddle.  i do not
say this to provoke her to give me a more vigorous charge: i am her
humble servant, and submit to her [[pleasure]]: let her be content, in god’s
name.  am i sensible of her assaults?  yes, i am. but, as those who are
possessed and [[oppressed]] with [[sorrow]] sometimes suffer themselves,
nevertheless, by intervals to taste a little [[pleasure]], and are sometimes
surprised with a smile, so have i so much [[power]] over myself, as to make
my ordinary condition quiet and [[free]] from disturbing thoughts [[thought]]; yet i
suffer myself, withal, by fits to be surprised with the stings of those
unpleasing imaginations [[imagination]] that assault me, whilst i am arming myself to
drive them away, or at least to wrestle with them.

but behold another aggravation of the [[evil]] which befell me in the tail of
the rest: both without doors and within i was assailed with a most
violent plague, [[violent]] in comparison of all others; for as sound bodies
are [[subject]] to more grievous maladies, forasmuch as they, are not to be
forced but by such, so my very healthful air, where no contagion, however
near, in the memory of [[man]], ever took footing, coming to be corrupted,
produced [[strange]] effects:

         “mista senum et juvenum densentur funera; nullum
          saeva caput proserpina fugit;”

     [“old and [[young]] [[die]] in mixed heaps.  cruel proserpine forbears
     none.”--horace, od., i. 28, 19.]

i had to suffer this pleasant condition, that the sight of my house, was
frightful to me; whatever i had there was without guard, and left to the
mercy of any one who wished to take it.  i myself, who am so hospitable,
was in very [[great]] distress for a retreat for my [[family]]; a distracted
family, frightful both to its [[friends]] and itself, and filling every place
with [[horror]] where it attempted to settle, having to shift its abode so
soon as any one’s finger began but to ache; all diseases are then
concluded to be the plague, and [[people]] do not stay to examine whether
they are so or no.  and the mischief on’t is that, according to the rules
of art [[arts]], in every danger that a [[man]] comes near, he must undergo a
quarantine in [[fear]] of the [[evil]], your [[imagination]] all the while tormenting
you at [[pleasure]], and turning even your health itself into a fever.  yet
all this would have much less affected me had i not withal been compelled
to be sensible of the sufferings of others, and miserably to serve six
months together for a guide to this caravan; for i carry my own antidotes
within myself, which are resolution and patience.  apprehension, which is
particularly feared in this disease, does not much trouble me; and, if
being alone, i should have been taken, it had been a less cheerless and
more remote departure; ‘tis a [[kind]] of [[death]] that i do not [[think]] of the
worst sort; ‘tis commonly short, stupid, without [[pain]], and consoled by
the [[public]] condition; without [[ceremony]], without mourning, without a
crowd.  but as to the [[people]] about us, the hundredth part of them could
not be saved:

              “videas desertaque regna
               pastorum, et longe saltus lateque vacantes.”

     [“you would see shepherds’ haunts deserted, and far and wide empty
     pastures.”--virgil, georg., iii. 476.]

in this place my largest [[revenue]] is manual: what an hundred [[men]] ploughed
for me, lay a long [[time]] fallow.

but then, what [[example]] of resolution did we not see in the simplicity of
all this [[people]]?  generally, every one renounced all [[care]] of [[life]]; the
grapes, the principal [[wealth]] of the [[country]], remained untouched upon the
vines; every [[man]] indifferently prepared for and expected [[death]], either
to-night or to-morrow, with a countenance and voice so far from [[fear]],
as if they had come to terms with this necessity, and that it was an
universal and inevitable sentence.  ‘tis always such; but how slender
hold has the resolution of dying?  the distance and difference of a few
hours, the sole consideration of company, renders its apprehension
various to us.  observe these [[people]]; by [[reason]] that they [[die]] in the same
month, [[children]], [[young]] [[people]], and old, they are no longer astonished at
it; they no longer lament.  i saw some who were afraid of staying behind,
as in a dreadful solitude; and i did not commonly observe any other
solicitude amongst them than that of sepulture; they were troubled to see
the [[dead]] bodies [[body]] scattered about the fields, at the [[mercy]] of the wild
beasts that presently flocked thither.  how differing are the fancies of
men; the neorites, a nation subjected by alexander, threw the bodies [[body]] of
their [[dead]] into the deepest and less frequented part of their woods, on
purpose to have them there eaten; the only sepulture reputed happy
amongst them.  some, who were yet in health, dug their own graves; others
laid themselves down in them whilst alive; and a labourer of mine, in
dying, with his hands and feet pulled the [[earth]] upon him.  was not this
to nestle and settle himself to sleep at greater ease?  a bravery in some
sort like that of the roman soldiers who, after the [[battle]] of cannae,
were found with their heads thrust into holes in the [[earth]], which they
had made, and in suffocating themselves, with their own hands pulled the
earth about their ears.  in short, a whole province was, by the common
usage, at once brought to a course nothing inferior in undauntedness to
the most [[studied]] and premeditated resolution.

most of the instructions of [[science]] to encourage us herein have in them
more of show than of [[force]], and more of ornament than of effect.  we have
abandoned [[nature]], and will [[teach]] her what to do; [[teach]] her who so happily
and so securely conducted us; and in the meantime, from the footsteps of
her instruction, and that little which, by the benefit of ignorance,
remains of her image imprinted in the [[life]] of this rustic rout of
unpolished [[men]], [[science]] is constrained every day to borrow patterns for
her disciples of constancy, tranquillity, and innocence.  it is pretty to
see that these persons [[person]], full of so much fine [[knowledge]], have to imitate
this foolish simplicity, and this in the primary actions of [[virtue]]; and
that our [[wisdom]] must learn even from beasts the most profitable
instructions in the [[greatest]] and most necessary concerns of our [[life]];
as, how we are to [[live]] and [[die]], manage our [[property]], [[love]] and bring up
our [[children]], maintain [[justice]]: a singular testimony of [[human]] infirmity;
and that this [[reason]] we so handle at our [[pleasure]], finding evermore some
diversity and novelty, leaves in us no apparent trace of [[nature]].  men
have done with [[nature]] as perfumers with oils; they have sophisticated her
with so many argumentations and far-fetched discourses, that she is
become variable and particular to each, and has lost her proper,
constant, and universal face; so that we must seek testimony from beasts,
not [[subject]] to favour, [[corruption]], or [[diversity]] of opinions [[opinion]].  it is,
indeed, true that even these themselves do not always go exactly in the
path of [[nature]], but wherein they swerve, it is so little that you may
always see the track; as horses that are [[led]] make many bounds and
curvets, but ‘tis always at the length of the halter, and still follow
him that leads them; and as a [[young]] hawk takes its flight, but still
under the restraint of its tether:

          “exsilia, torments, bells, morbos, naufragia meditare .  .  .
          ut nullo sis malo tiro.”

     [“to meditate upon banishments, tortures, wars [[war]], diseases, and
     shipwrecks, that thou mayest not be a novice in any disaster.”
      --seneca, ep., 91, 107.]

what [[good]] will this curiosity do us, to anticipate all the inconveniences
of [[human]] [[nature]], and to prepare ourselves with so much trouble against
things which, peradventure, will never befall us?

          “parem passis tristitiam facit, pati posse;”

          [“it troubles [[men]] as much that they may possibly suffer,
          as if they really did suffer.”--idem, ibid., 74.]

not only the blow, but the wind of the blow strikes us: or, like
phrenetic people--for certainly it is a phrensy--to go immediately and
whip yourself, because it may so fall out that [[fortune]] may one day make
you undergo it; and to put on your furred gown at midsummer, because you
will stand in need of it at christmas!  throw yourselves, say they, into
the [[experience]] of all the evils [[evil]], the most extreme evils [[evil]] that can possibly
befall you, and so be assured of them.  on the contrary, the most easy
and most [[natural]] way would be to banish even the thoughts [[thought]] of them; they
will not come soon enough; their true being will not continue with us
long enough; our [[mind]] must lengthen and extend them; we must incorporate
them in us beforehand, and there entertain them, as if they would not
otherwise sufficiently press upon our senses.  “we shall find them heavy
enough when they come,” says one of our masters, of none of the tender
sects, but of the most severe; “in the meantime, favour thyself; believe
what pleases thee [[best]]; what [[good]] will it do thee to anticipate thy ill
fortune, to lose the [[present]] for [[fear]] of the future: and to make thyself
miserable now, because thou art [[arts]] to be so in [[time]]?”  these are his words.
science, indeed, does us one [[good]] office in instructing us exactly as to
the dimensions of evils [[evil]],

                    “curis acuens mortalia corda!”

     [“probing mortal hearts [[heart]] with cares [[care]].”--virgil, georg., i. 23.]

‘twere [[pity]] that any part of their greatness should escape our sense and
knowledge.

‘tis [[certain]] that for the most part the preparation for [[death]] has
administered more torment than the thing itself.  it was of old truly
said, and by a very judicious author:

          “minus afficit sensus fatigatio, quam cogitatio.”

     [“suffering itself less afflicts the senses than the apprehension
     of suffering.”--quintilian, inst. orat., i. 12.]

the sentiment of [[present]] [[death]] sometimes, of itself, animates us with a
prompt resolution not to avoid a thing that is utterly inevitable: many
gladiators have been seen in the olden [[time]], who, after having fought
timorously and ill, have courageously entertained [[death]], offering their
throats to the enemies’ [[sword]] and bidding them despatch.  the sight of
future [[death]] requires a [[courage]] that is slow, and consequently hard to be
got.  if you [[know]] not how to [[die]], never trouble yourself; [[nature]] will, at
the [[time]], fully and sufficiently instruct you: she will exactly do that
business for you; take you no care--

              “incertam frustra, mortales, funeris horam,
               quaeritis et qua sit mors aditura via....
               poena minor certam subito perferre ruinam;
               quod timeas, gravius sustinuisse diu.”

     [“mortals, in [[vain]] you seek to [[know]] the uncertain hour of [[death]],
     and by what channel it will come upon you.”--propertius, ii. 27, 1.
     “‘tis less painful to undergo sudden destruction; ‘tis hard to bear
     that which you long [[fear]].”--incert. auct.]

we trouble [[life]] by the [[care]] of [[death]], and [[death]] by the [[care]] of [[life]]: the
one torments, the other frights us.  it is not against [[death]] that we
prepare, that is too momentary a thing; a quarter of an hour’s suffering,
without consequence and without damage, does not deserve especial
precepts: to say the [[truth]], we prepare ourselves against the preparations
of [[death]].  [[philosophy]] ordains that we should always have [[death]] before our
eyes, to see and consider it before the [[time]], and then gives us rules [[rule]] and
precautions to provide that this foresight and [[thought]] do us no harm;
just so do physicians, who throw us into diseases, to the end they may
have whereon to employ their drugs and their art [[arts]].  if we have not known
how to [[live]], ‘tis [[injustice]] to [[teach]] us how to [[die]], and make the end
difform from all the rest; if we have known how to [[live]] firmly and
quietly, we shall [[know]] how to [[die]] so too.  they may boast as much as they
please:

          “tota philosophorum vita commentatio mortis est;”

     [“the whole [[life]] of [[philosophers]] is the meditation of [[death]].”
      --cicero, tusc.  quaes., ii. 30.]

but i fancy that, though it be the end, it is not the aim of [[life]]; ‘tis
its end, its extremity, but not, nevertheless, its object; it ought
itself to be its own aim and design; its true study is to order, govern,
and suffer itself.  in the number of several other offices, that the
general and principal [[chapter]] of knowing how to [[live]] comprehends, is this
article of knowing how to [[die]]; and, did not our fears [[fear]] give it weight,
one of the lightest too.

to [[judge]] of them by utility and by the naked [[truth]], the lessons of
simplicity are not much inferior to those which learning teaches [[teach]] us: nay,
quite the contrary.  [[men]] differ in sentiment and [[force]]; we must lead them
to their own [[good]] according to their capacities and by various ways:

          “quo me comque rapit tempestas, deferor hospes.”

     [“wherever the season takes me,(where the tempest drives me)
     there i am carried as a guest.”--horace, ep., i. i, 15.]

i never saw any peasant among my neighbours cogitate with what
countenance and assurance he should pass over his [[last]] hour; nature
teaches him not to [[think]] of [[death]] till he is dying; and then he does it
with a [[better]] grace than [[aristotle]], upon whom [[death]] presses with a double
weight, both of itself and from so long a premeditation; and, therefore,
it was the [[opinion]] of caesar, that the least premeditated [[death]] was the
easiest and the most [[happy]]:

     “plus dolet quam necesse est, qui ante dolet, quam necesse est.”

     [“he grieves more than is necessary, who grieves before it is
     necessary.”--seneca, ep., 98.]

the sharpness of this [[imagination]] springs from our curiosity: ‘tis thus
we ever impede ourselves, desiring to anticipate and regulate natural
prescripts.  it is only for the doctors to dine worse for it, when in the
best health, and to frown at the image of [[death]]; the [[common]] sort stand in
need of no remedy or consolation, but just in the shock, and when the
blow comes; and consider on’t no more than just what they endure.  is it
not then, as we say, that the stolidity and want of apprehension in the
vulgar give them that patience m [[present]] evils [[evil]], and that profound
carelessness of future sinister accidents?  that their souls [[soul]], in being
more gross and dull, are less penetrable and not so easily moved?  if it
be so, let us henceforth, in [[god’s]] name, [[teach]] nothing but ignorance;
‘tis the utmost fruit the sciences [[science]] promise us, to which this stolidity so
gently leads its disciples.

we have no want of [[good]] masters, interpreters of [[natural]] simplicity.
socrates shall be one; for, as i [[remember]], he speaks something to this
purpose to the judges [[judge]] who sat upon his [[life]] and [[death]].

     [that which follows is taken from the apology of [[socrates]] in [[plato]],
     chap.  17, &c.]

“i am afraid, my masters, that if i entreat you not to put me to [[death]], i
shall confirm the charge of my accusers, which is, that i pretend to be
wiser than others, as having some more secret [[knowledge]] of things that
are above and below us.  i have neither frequented nor known [[death]], nor
have ever seen any [[person]] that has tried its qualities, from whom to
inform myself.  such as [[fear]] it, presuppose they [[know]] it; as for my part,
i neither [[know]] what it is, nor what they do in the other [[world]].  death
is, peradventure, an indifferent thing; peradventure, a thing to be
desired.  ‘tis nevertheless to be believed, if it be a transmigration
from one place to another, that it is a bettering of one’s condition to
go and [[live]] with so many [[great]] persons [[person]] deceased, and to be exempt from
having any more to do with [[unjust]] and [[corrupt]] judges [[judge]]; if it be an
annihilation of our being, ‘tis yet a bettering of one’s condition to
enter into a long and peaceable night; we find nothing more sweet in life
than quiet repose and a profound sleep without dreams [[dream]].  the things that
i [[know]] to be [[evil]], as to injure one’s neighbour and to disobey one’s
superior, whether it be [[god]] or [[man]], i carefully avoid; such as i do not
know whether they be [[good]] or [[evil]], i cannot [[fear]] them.  if i am to die
and leave you alive, the gods alone only [[know]] whether it will go better
with you or with me.  wherefore, as to what concerns me, you may do as
you shall [[think]] fit.  but according to my method of advising just and
profitable things, i say that you will do your consciences more [[right]] to
set me at [[liberty]], unless you see further into my cause than i do; and,
judging according to my [[past]] actions, both [[public]] and private, according
to my intentions, and according to the [[profit]] that so many of our
citizens, both [[young]] and old, daily extract from my conversation, and the
fruit that you all reap from me, you cannot more duly acquit yourselves
towards my [[merit]] than in ordering that, my [[poverty]] considered, i should
be maintained at the prytanaeum, at the [[public]] expense, a thing that i
have often known you, with less [[reason]], grant to others.  do not impute
it to obstinacy or disdain that i do not, according to the custom,
supplicate and go about to move you to commiseration.  i have both
friends and kindred, not being, as [[homer]] says, begotten of wood or of
stone, no more than others, who might well [[present]] themselves before you
with tears and mourning, and i have three desolate [[children]] with whom to
move you to compassion; but i should do a shame to our [[city]] at the [[age]] i
am, and in the [[reputation]] of [[wisdom]] which is now charged against me, to
appear in such an abject form.  what would [[men]] say of the other
athenians?  i have always admonished those who have frequented my
lectures, not to redeem their lives [[life]] by an unbecoming action; and in the
wars of my [[country]], at amphipolis, potidea, delia, and other expeditions
where i have been, i have effectually manifested how far i was from
securing my safety by my shame.  i should, moreover, compromise your
duty, and should invite you to unbecoming things; for ‘tis not for my
prayers to persuade you, but for the pure and solid reasons [[reason]] of [[justice]].
you have sworn to the gods to keep yourselves upright; and it would seem
as if i suspected you, or would recriminate upon you that i do not
believe that you are so; and i should testify against myself, not to
believe them as i ought, mistrusting their conduct, and not purely
committing my affair into their hands.  i wholly rely upon them; and hold
myself assured they will do in this what shall be most fit both for you
and for me: [[good]] [[men]], whether living or [[dead]], have no [[reason]] to [[fear]] the
gods.”

is not this an [[innocent]] child’s pleading of an unimaginable loftiness,
true, frank, and just, unexampled?--and in what a necessity employed!
truly, he had very [[good]] [[reason]] to prefer it before that which the great
orator lysias had penned for him: admirably couched, indeed, in the
judiciary style, but unworthy of so [[noble]] a [[criminal]].  had a suppliant
voice been heard out of the mouth of [[socrates]], that lofty [[virtue]] had
struck sail in the height of its [[glory]]; and ought his [[rich]] and powerful
nature to have committed her defence to art [[arts]], and, in her highest proof,
have renounced [[truth]] and simplicity, the ornaments of his speaking, to
adorn and deck herself with the embellishments of figures and the
flourishes of a premeditated [[speech]]?  he did very wisely, and like
himself, not to [[corrupt]] the tenor of an incorrupt [[life]], and so [[sacred]] an
image of the [[human]] form, to spin out his decrepitude another year, and to
betray the [[immortal]] memory of that glorious end.  he owed his [[life]] not to
himself, but to the [[example]] of the [[world]]; had it not been a public
damage, that he should have concluded it after a lazy and obscure manner?
assuredly, that careless and indifferent consideration of his death
deserved that [[posterity]] should consider it so much the more, as indeed
they did; and there is nothing so just in [[justice]] than that which fortune
ordained for his recommendation; for the athenians abominated all those
who had been causers of his [[death]] to such a [[degree]], that they avoided
them as excommunicated persons [[person]], and looked upon everything as polluted
that had been touched by them; no one would wash with them in the public
baths, none would salute or own acquaintance with them: so that, at [[last]],
unable longer to support this [[public]] [[hatred]], they [[hanged]] themselves.

if any one shall [[think]] that, amongst so many other examples [[example]] that i had to
choose out of in the sayings of [[socrates]] for my [[present]] [[purpose]], i have
made an ill [[choice]] of this, and shall [[judge]] this discourse of his
elevated above [[common]] conceptions, i must tell them that i have properly
selected it; for i am of another [[opinion]], and hold it to be a discourse,
in rank and simplicity, much below and behind [[common]] conceptions.  he
represents, in an inartificial boldness and infantine security, the pure
and first impression and ignorance of [[nature]]; for it is to be believed
that we have naturally a [[fear]] of [[pain]], but not of [[death]], by [[reason]] of
itself; ‘tis a part of our being, and no less essential than living.

to what end should [[nature]] have begotten in us a [[hatred]] to it and a horror
of it, considering that it is of so [[great]] utility to her in maintaining
the succession and vicissitude of her works [[work]]? and that in this universal
republic, it conduces more to birth and augmentation than to loss or
ruin?

                  “sic rerum summa novatur.”

               “mille animas una necata dedit.”

“the failing of one [[life]] is the passage to a thousand other lives [[life]].”

nature has imprinted in beasts the [[care]] of themselves and of their
conservation; they proceed so far as hitting or hurting to be timorous of
being worse, of themselves, of our haltering and beating them, accidents
subject to their sense and [[experience]]; but that we should kill them, they
cannot [[fear]], nor have they the faculty to imagine and conclude such a
thing as [[death]]; it is said, indeed, that we see them not only cheerfully
undergo it, horses for the most part neighing and swans singing when they
die, but, moreover, seek it at need, of which elephants have given many
examples.

besides, the method of arguing, of which [[socrates]] here makes use, is it
not equally admirable both in simplicity and vehemence?  truly it is much
more easy to speak like [[aristotle]] and to [[live]] like caesar than to speak
and [[live]] as [[socrates]] did; there lies [[lie]] the extreme [[degree]] of [[perfection]] and
difficulty; art [[arts]] cannot reach it.  now, our faculties are not so trained
up; we do not try, we do not [[know]] them; we invest ourselves with those of
others, and let our own [[lie]] idle; as some one may say of me, that i have
here only made a nosegay of [[foreign]] flowers, having furnished nothing of
my own but the thread to tie them.

certainly i have so far yielded to [[public]] [[opinion]], that those borrowed
ornaments accompany me; but i do not mean that they shall cover me and
hide me; that is quite contrary to my design, who [[desire]] to make a show
of nothing but what is my own, and what is my own by [[nature]]; and had i
taken my own [[advice]], i had at all hazards spoken purely alone, i more and
more load myself every day,

     [in [[fact]], the first edition of the essays (bordeaux, 1580) has very
     few quotations.  these became more numerous in the edition of 1588;
     but the multitude of classical texts which at times [[time]] encumber
     montaigne’s text, only dates from the posthumous edition of 1595, he
     had made these collections in the four [[last]] years of his [[life]], as an
     amusement of his “idleness.”--le clerc.  they grow, however, more
     sparing in the third [[book]].]

beyond my [[purpose]] and first method, upon the account of idleness and the
humour of the [[age]].  if it misbecome me, as i [[believe]] it does, ‘tis no
matter; it may be of use to some others.  such there are who quote plato
and [[homer]], who never saw either of them; and i also have taken things out
of places far enough distant from their source.  without pains [[pain]] and
without learning, having a thousand volumes about me in the place where i
write, i can presently borrow, if i please, from a dozen such
scrap-gatherers, [[people]] about whom i do not much trouble myself, wherewith
to trick up this treatise of physiognomy; there needs no more but a
preliminary epistle of a [[german]] to stuff me with quotations.  and so it
is we go in quest of a tickling story to [[cheat]] the foolish [[world]].  these
lumber pies of commonplaces, wherewith so many furnish their studies, are
of little use but to [[common]] subjects [[subject]], and serve but to show us, and not
to direct us: a ridiculous fruit of learning, that [[socrates]] so pleasantly
discusses against euthydemus.  i have seen books [[book]] made of things that were
never either [[studied]] or understood; the author committing to several of
his learned [[friends]] the examination of this and t’other matter to compile
it, contenting himself, for his share, with having projected the design,
and by his industry to have tied together this faggot of unknown
provisions; the ink and paper, at least, are his.  this is to buy or
borrow a [[book]], and not to make one; ‘tis to show [[men]] not that he can make
a [[book]], but that, whereof they may be in [[doubt]], he cannot make one.
a president, where i was, boasted that he had amassed together two
hundred and odd commonplaces in one of his judgments [[judgment]]; in telling which,
he deprived himself of the [[glory]] he had got by it: in my [[opinion]], a
pusillanimous and absurd vanity for such a [[subject]] and such a [[person]].
i do the contrary; and amongst so many borrowed things, am glad if i can
steal one, disguising and altering it for some new service; at the hazard
of having it said that ‘tis for want of understanding its [[natural]] use;
i give it some particular touch of my own hand, to the end it may not be
so absolutely [[foreign]].  these set their thefts in show and value
themselves upon them, and so have more credit with the laws [[law]] than i have:
we naturalists i [[think]] that there is a [[great]] and incomparable preference
in the [[honour]] of invention over that of allegation.

if i would have spoken by learning, i had spoken sooner; i had written of
the [[time]] nearer to my studies, when i had more wit and [[better]] memory, and
should sooner have trusted to the vigour of that [[age]] than of this, would
i have made a [[business]] of writing.  and what if this gracious favour
--[his acquaintance with mademoiselle de gournay.]--which [[fortune]] has
lately offered me upon the account of this [[work]], had befallen me in that
time of my [[life]], instead of this, wherein ‘tis equally desirable to
possess, soon to be lost!  two of my acquaintance, [[great]] [[men]] in this
faculty, have, in my [[opinion]], lost half, in refusing to publish at forty
years old, that they might stay till threescore.  maturity has its
defects as well as green years, and worse; and old [[age]] is as unfit for
this [[kind]] of [[business]] as any other.  he who commits his decrepitude to
the press plays the [[fool]] if he [[think]] to squeeze anything out thence that
does not relish of dreaming, dotage, and drivelling; the [[mind]] grows
costive and thick in growing old.  i deliver my ignorance in pomp and
state, and my learning meagrely and poorly; this accidentally and
accessorily, that principally and expressly; and write specifically of
nothing but nothing, nor of any [[science]] but of that inscience.  i have
chosen a [[time]] when my [[life]], which i am to give an account of, lies [[lie]] wholly
before me; what remains has more to do with [[death]]; and of my death
itself, should i find it a prating [[death]], as others do, i would willingly
give an account at my departure.

socrates was a [[perfect]] exemplar in all [[great]] qualities, and i am vexed
that he had so deformed a face and [[body]] as is said, and so unsuitable to
the [[beauty]] of his [[soul]], himself being so amorous and such an admirer of
beauty: [[nature]] did him [[wrong]].  there is nothing more probable than the
conformity and relation of the [[body]] to the [[soul]]:

     “ipsi animi magni refert, quali in corpore locati sint: multo enim a
     corpore existunt, qux acuant mentem: multa qua obtundant;”

     [“it is of [[great]] consequence in what bodies [[body]] minds [[mind]] are placed, for
     many things spring from the [[body]] that may sharpen the [[mind]], and many
     that may blunt it.”--cicero, tusc.  quaes., i. 33.]

this refers to an unnatural ugliness and deformity of limbs; but we call
ugliness also an unseemliness at first sight, which is principally lodged
in the face, and disgusts us on very slight grounds: by the [[complexion]], a
spot, a rugged countenance, for some reasons [[reason]] often wholly inexplicable,
in members nevertheless of [[good]] symmetry and [[perfect]].  the deformity,
that clothed a very beautiful [[soul]] in la boetie, was of this predicament:
that superficial ugliness, which nevertheless is always the most
imperious, is of least prejudice to the [[state]] of the [[mind]], and of little
certainty in the [[opinion]] of [[men]].  the other, which is never properly
called deformity, being more substantial, strikes deeper in.  not every
shoe of smooth shining leather, but every shoe well-made, shews the shape
of the foot within.  as [[socrates]] said of his, it betrayed [[equal]] ugliness
in his [[soul]], had he not corrected it by [[education]]; but in saying so, i
hold he was in jest, as his custom was; never so excellent a [[soul]] formed
itself.

i cannot often enough repeat how [[great]] an esteem i have for [[beauty]], that
potent and advantageous quality; he (la boetie) called it “a short
tyranny,” and [[plato]], “the [[privilege]] of [[nature]].”  we have nothing that
excels it in [[reputation]]; it has the first place in the commerce of [[men]];
it presents [[present]] itself in the front; seduces and prepossesses our judgments
with [[great]] [[authority]] and wonderful impression.  phryne had lost her cause
in the hands of an excellent advocate, if, opening her robe, she had not
corrupted her judges [[judge]] by the lustre of her [[beauty]].  and i find that cyrus,
alexander, and caesar, the three masters of the [[world]], never neglected
beauty in their [[greatest]] affairs; no more did the first scipio.  the same
word in [[greek]] signifies both [[fair]] and [[good]]; and the holy word often says
good when it means [[fair]]: i should willingly maintain the priority in good
things, according to the [[song]] that [[plato]] calls an idle thing, taken out
of some ancient poet: “health, [[beauty]], riches [[rich]].”  [[aristotle]] says that the
right of command appertains to the beautiful; and that, when there is a
person whose [[beauty]] comes near the images of the gods, veneration is
equally due to him.  to him who [[asked]] why [[people]] oftener and longer
frequent the company of handsome persons [[person]]: “that [[question]],” said he, “is
only to be [[asked]] by the blind.”  most of the [[philosophers]], and the
greatest, paid for their schooling, and acquired [[wisdom]] by the favour and
mediation of their [[beauty]].  not only in the [[men]] that serve me, but also
in the beasts, i consider it within two fingers’ breadth of goodness.

and yet i fancy that those features and moulds of face, and those
lineaments, by which [[men]] guess at our internal complexions and our
fortunes to come, is a thing that does not very directly and simply lie
under the [[chapter]] of [[beauty]] and deformity, no more than every [[good]] odour
and serenity of air promises health, nor all fog and stink infection in a
time of pestilence.  such as accuse ladies [[lady]] of contradicting their beauty
by their manners, do not always hit [[right]]; for, in a face which is none
of the [[best]], there may dwell some air of probity and trust; as, on the
contrary, i have [[read]], betwixt two beautiful [[eyes]], menaces of a dangerous
and malignant [[nature]].  there are favourable physiognomies, so that in a
crowd of victorious enemies [[enemy]], you shall presently choose, amongst [[men]] you
never saw before, one rather than another to whom to [[surrender]], and with
whom to intrust your [[life]]; and yet not properly upon the consideration of
beauty.

a person’s look is but a feeble warranty; and yet it is something
considerable too; and if i had to lash them, i would most severely
scourge the wicked ones who belie and betray the promises that [[nature]] has
planted in their foreheads; i should with greater severity punish malice
under a mild and gentle aspect.  it seems as if there were some lucky and
some unlucky faces; and i [[believe]] there is some art [[arts]] in distinguishing
affable from merely simple faces, severe from rugged, malicious from
pensive, scornful from melancholic, and such other bordering qualities.
there are beauties [[beauty]] which are not only haughty, but sour, and others that
are not only gentle, but more than that, insipid; to prognosticate from
them future events is a matter that i shall leave undecided.

i have, as i have said elsewhere as to my own concern, simply and
implicitly embraced this ancient [[rule]], “that we cannot fail in following
nature,” and that the [[sovereign]] precept is to conform ourselves to her.
i have not, as [[socrates]] did, corrected my [[natural]] composition by the
force of [[reason]], and have not in the least disturbed my inclination by
art; i have let myself go as i came: i contend not; my two principal
parts [[live]], of their own accord, in [[peace]] and [[good]] [[intelligence]], but my
nurse’s milk, thank [[god]], was tolerably wholesome and [[good]].  shall i say
this by the way, that i see in greater esteem than ‘tis worth, and in use
solely among ourselves, a [[certain]] image of scholastic probity, a [[slave]] to
precepts, and fettered with [[hope]] and [[fear]]?  i would have it such as that
laws and religions [[religion]] should not make, but [[perfect]] and authorise it; that
finds it has wherewithal to support itself without [[help]], born and rooted
in us from the seed of universal [[reason]], imprinted in every [[man]] by
nature.  that [[reason]] which strengthens [[socrates]] from his vicious bend
renders him [[obedient]] to the gods and [[men]] of [[authority]] in his [[city]]:
courageous in [[death]], not because his [[soul]] is [[immortal]], but because he is
mortal.  ‘tis a doctrine ruinous to all [[government]], and much more hurtful
than ingenious and subtle, which persuades the [[people]] that a religious
belief is alone sufficient, and without conduct, to satisfy the divine
justice.  use demonstrates to us a vast distinction betwixt devotion and
conscience.

i have a favourable aspect, both in form and in interpretation:

               “quid dixi, habere me? imo habui, chreme.”

          [“what did i say?  that i have?  no, chremes, i had.”
           --terence, heaut., act i., sec. 2, v. 42.]

               “heu!  tantum attriti corporis ossa vides;”

          [“alas! of a worn [[body]] thou seest only the bones”]

and that makes a quite contrary show to that of [[socrates]].  it has often
befallen me, that upon the mere credit of my presence and air, persons
who had no manner of [[knowledge]] of me have put a very [[great]] confidence in
me, whether in their own affairs or mine; and i have in [[foreign]] parts
thence obtained singular and rare favours.  but the two following
examples are, peradventure, worth particular relation.  a [[certain]] person
planned to surprise my house and me in it; his scheme was to come to my
gates alone, and to be importunate to be let in.  i knew him by name,
and had [[fair]] [[reason]] to repose confidence in him, as being my neighbour
and something related to me.  i caused the gates to be opened to him,
as i do to every one.  there i found him, with every appearance of alarm,
his horse panting and very tired.  he entertained me with this story:
“that, about half a league off, he had met with a [[certain]] [[enemy]] of his,
whom i also knew, and had heard of their quarrel; that his [[enemy]] had
given him a very brisk chase, and that having been surprised in disorder,
and his party being too [[weak]], he had fled to my gates for refuge;
and that he was in [[great]] trouble for his followers, whom (he said) he
concluded to be all either [[dead]] or taken.”  i innocently did my [[best]] to
comfort, assure, and refresh him.  shortly after came four or five of his
soldiers, who presented themselves in the same countenance and affright,
to get in too; and after them more, and still more, very well mounted and
armed, to the number of five-and-twenty or thirty, pretending that they
had the [[enemy]] at their heels.  this mystery began a little to awaken my
suspicion; i was not ignorant what an [[age]] i lived in, how much my house
might be envied, and i had several examples [[example]] of others of my acquaintance
to whom a mishap of this sort had happened.  but thinking there was
nothing to be got by having begun to do a courtesy, unless i went through
with it, and that i could not disengage myself from them without spoiling
all, i let myself go the most [[natural]] and simple way, as i always do, and
invited them all to come in. and in [[truth]] i am naturally very little
inclined to suspicion and distrust; i willingly incline towards excuse
and the gentlest interpretation; i take [[men]] according to the common
order, and do not more [[believe]] in those perverse and unnatural
inclinations, unless convinced by manifest evidence, than i do in
monsters and [[miracles]]; and i am, moreover, a [[man]] who willingly commit
myself to [[fortune]], and throw myself headlong into her arms; and i have
hitherto found more [[reason]] to applaud than to blame myself for so doing,
having ever found her more discreet about, and a greater friend to, my
affairs than i am myself.  there are some actions in my [[life]] whereof the
conduct may justly be called difficult, or, if you please, prudent; of
these, supposing the third part to have been my own, doubtless the other
two-thirds were absolutely hers.  we make, methinks, a mistake in that we
do not enough trust [[heaven]] with our affairs, and pretend to more from our
own conduct than appertains to us; and therefore it is that our designs
so often miscarry. [[heaven]] is [[jealous]] of the extent that we attribute to
the [[right]] of [[human]] prudence above its own, and cuts it all the shorter by
how much the more we amplify it.  the [[last]] comers remained on horseback
in my courtyard, whilst their leader, who was with me in the parlour,
would not have his horse put up in the stable, saying he should
immediately retire, so soon as he had news of his [[men]].  he saw himself
master of his enterprise, and nothing now remained but its execution.
he has since several times [[time]] said (for he was not ashamed to tell the story
himself) that my countenance and frankness had snatched the treachery out
of his hands.  he again mounted his horse; his followers, who had their
eyes intent upon him, to see when he would give the signal, being very
much astonished to find him come away and leave his prey behind him.

another [[time]], relying upon some truce just published in the [[army]], i took
a [[journey]] through a very ticklish [[country]].  i had not ridden far, but i
was discovered, and two or three parties of horse, from various places,
were sent out to seize me; one of them overtook me on the third day, and
i was attacked by fifteen or twenty gentlemen in vizors, followed at a
distance by a band of foot-soldiers.  i was taken, withdrawn into the
thick of a neighbouring forest, dismounted, robbed, my trunks rifled, my
money-box taken, and my horses and equipage divided amongst new masters.
we had, in this copse, a very long contest about my ransom, which they
set so high, that it was manifest that i was not known to them.  they
were, moreover, in a very [[great]] debate about my [[life]]; and, in [[truth]],
there were various circumstances that clearly showed the danger i was in:

          “tunc animis opus, aenea, tunc pectore firmo.”

     [“then, [[aeneas]], there is need of [[courage]], of a firm [[heart]].”
      --aeneid, vi. 261.]

i still insisted upon the truce, too willing they should have the gain of
what they had already taken from me, which was not to be despised,
without promise of any other ransom.  after two or three hours that we
had been in this place, and that they had mounted me upon a horse that
was not likely to run from them, and committed me to the guard of fifteen
or twenty harquebusiers, and dispersed my servants to others, having
given order that they should carry us away prisoners [[prisoner]] several ways, and i
being already got some two or three musket-shots from the place,

          “jam prece pollucis, jam castoris, implorata,”

          [“by a prayer addressed now to pollux, now to castor.”
           --catullus, lxvi. 65.]

behold a sudden and unexpected alteration; i saw the [[chief]] return to me
with gentler [[language]], making search amongst the troopers for my
scattered [[property]], and causing as much as could be recovered to be
restored to me, even to my money-box; but the [[best]] [[present]] they made was
my [[liberty]], for the rest did not much concern me at that [[time]].  the true
cause of so sudden a [[change]], and of this reconsideration, without any
apparent impulse, and of so miraculous a repentance, in such a [[time]], in a
planned and deliberate enterprise, and become just by usage (for, at the
first dash, i plainly confessed to them of what party i was, and whither
i was going), truly, i do not yet rightly [[understand]].  the most prominent
amongst them, who pulled off his vizor and told me his name, repeatedly
told me at the [[time]], over and over again, that i owed my deliverance to
my countenance, and the [[liberty]] and boldness of my [[speech]], that rendered
me unworthy of such a misadventure, and should secure me from its
repetition.  ‘tis possible that the [[divine]] goodness willed to make use of
this [[vain]] instrument for my preservation; and it, moreover, defended me
the next day from other and worse ambushes, of which these my assailants
had given me warning.  the [[last]] of these two gentlemen is yet living
himself to tell the story; the first was killed not long ago.

if my face did not [[answer]] for me, if [[men]] did not [[read]] in my [[eyes]] and in
my voice the innocence of intention, i had not lived so long without
quarrels and without giving offence, seeing the indiscreet whatever comes
into my head, and to [[judge]] so rashly of things.  this way may, with
reason, appear uncivil, and ill adapted to our way of conversation; but
i have never met with any who judged it outrageous or malicious, or that
took offence at my [[liberty]], if he had it from my own mouth; words
repeated have another [[kind]] of sound and sense.  nor do i hate any [[person]];
and i am so slow to offend, that i cannot do it, even upon the account of
reason itself; and when [[occasion]] has required me to sentence criminals [[criminal]],
i have rather chosen to fail in point of [[justice]] than to do it:

               “ut magis peccari nolim, quam satis animi
               ad vindicanda peccata habeam.”

     [“so that i had rather [[men]] should not commit faults [[fault]] than that i
     should have sufficient [[courage]] to condemn them.”---livy, xxxix. 21.]

aristotle, ‘tis said, was reproached for having been too merciful to a
wicked [[man]]: “i was indeed,” said he, “merciful to the [[man]], but not to his
wickedness.”  ordinary judgments [[judgment]] exasperate themselves to [[punishment]] by
the [[horror]] of the [[fact]]: but it cools mine; the [[horror]] of the first murder
makes me [[fear]] a second; and the deformity of the first [[cruelty]] makes me
abhor all imitation of it.’ that may be applied to me, who am but a
squire of clubs, which was said of charillus, [[king]] of sparta: “he cannot
be [[good]], seeing he is not [[evil]] even to the wicked.”  or thus--for
plutarch delivers it both these ways, as he does a thousand other things,
variously and contradictorily--“he must needs be [[good]], because he is so
even to the wicked.”  even as in lawful actions i dislike to employ
myself when for such as are displeased at it; so, to say the [[truth]], in
unlawful things i do not make [[conscience]] enough of employing myself when
it is for such as are willing.

xiii.  of [[experience]].



chapter xiii

of experience

there is no [[desire]] more [[natural]] than that of [[knowledge]].  we try all ways
that can lead us to it; where [[reason]] is wanting, we therein employ
experience,

              “per varios usus artem experientia fecit,
               exemplo monstrante viam,”

     [“by various trials [[experience]] created art [[arts]], [[example]] shewing the
     way.”--manilius, i. 59.]

which is a means much more [[weak]] and cheap; but [[truth]] is so [[great]] a thing
that we ought not to disdain any mediation that will guide us to it.
reason has so many forms that we [[know]] not to which to take; experience
has no fewer; the consequence we would draw from the comparison of events
is unsure, by [[reason]] they are always unlike.  there is no quality so
universal in this image of things as [[diversity]] and variety.  both the
greeks and the latins and we, for the most express [[example]] of similitude,
employ that of eggs; and yet there have been [[men]], particularly one at
delphos, who could distinguish marks of difference amongst eggs so well
that he never mistook one for another, and having many hens, could tell
which had laid it.

dissimilitude intrudes itself of itself in our works [[work]]; no art [[arts]] can arrive
at [[perfect]] similitude: neither perrozet nor any other can so carefully
polish and blanch the backs of his cards that some gamesters will not
distinguish them by seeing them only shuffled by another.  resemblance
does not so much make one as difference makes another.  [[nature]] has
obliged herself to make nothing other that was not unlike.

and yet i am not much pleased with his [[opinion]], who [[thought]] by the
multitude of laws [[law]] to curb the [[authority]] of judges [[judge]] in cutting out for them
their several parcels; he was not aware that there is as much [[liberty]] and
latitude in the interpretation of laws [[law]] as in their form; and they but
fool themselves, who [[think]] to lessen and stop our disputes by recalling
us to the express words of the bible: forasmuch as our [[mind]] does not find
the field less spacious wherein to controvert the sense of another than
to deliver his own; and as if there were less animosity and tartness in
commentary than in invention.  we see how much he was mistaken, for we
have more laws [[law]] in [[france]] than all the rest of the [[world]] put together, and
more than would be necessary for the [[government]] of all the worlds [[world]] of
epicurus:

          “ut olim flagitiis, sic nunc legibus, laboramus.”

     [“as we were formerly by crimes, so we are now overburdened by
     laws [[law]].”--tacitus, annal., iii. 25.]

and yet we have left so much to the opinions [[opinion]] and decisions of our judges
that there never was so full a [[liberty]] or so full a license.  what have
our legislators gained by culling out a hundred thousand particular
cases, and by applying to these a hundred thousand laws [[law]]?  this number
holds no manner of proportion with the infinite [[diversity]] of human
actions; the multiplication of our inventions will never arrive at the
variety of examples [[example]]; add to these a hundred times [[time]] as many more, it will
still not happen that, of events to come, there shall one be found that,
in this vast number of millions of events so chosen and recorded, shall
so tally with any other one, and be so exactly coupled and matched with
it that there will not remain some circumstance and [[diversity]] which will
require a diverse [[judgment]].  there is little relation betwixt our
actions, which are in perpetual mutation, and fixed and immutable laws [[law]];
the most to be [[desired]] are those that are the most rare, the most simple
and general; and i am even of [[opinion]] that we had [[better]] have none at all
than to have them in so prodigious a number as we have.

nature always gives them [[better]] and happier than those we make ourselves;
witness the picture of the golden [[age]] of the poets and the [[state]] wherein
we see nations [[live]] who have no other.  some there are, who for their
only [[judge]] take the first passer-by that travels along their mountains,
to determine their cause; and others who, on their market day, choose out
some one amongst them upon the spot to decide their controversies.  what
danger would there be that the wisest amongst us should so determine
ours, according to occurrences and at sight, without obligation of
example and consequence?  for every foot its own shoe.  [[king]] ferdinand,
sending colonies to the indies, wisely provided that they should not
carry along with them any students of jurisprudence, for [[fear]] lest suits
should get footing in that new [[world]], as being a [[science]] in its own
nature, breeder of altercation and division; judging with [[plato]], “that
lawyers and physicians are [[bad]] [[institutions]] of a [[country]].”

whence does it come to pass that our [[common]] [[language]], so easy for all
other uses, becomes obscure and unintelligible in wills and contracts?
and that he who so clearly expresses himself in whatever else he speaks
or writes, cannot find in these any way of declaring himself that does
not fall into [[doubt]] and contradiction? if it be not that the princes [[prince]] of
that art [[arts]], applying themselves with a peculiar attention to cull out
portentous words and to contrive artificial sentences, have so weighed
every syllable, and so thoroughly sifted every sort of quirking
connection that they are now confounded and entangled in the infinity of
figures and minute divisions, and can no more fall within any [[rule]] or
prescription, nor any [[certain]] [[intelligence]]:

          “confusum est, quidquid usque in pulverem sectum est.”

     [“whatever is beaten into powder is undistinguishable (confused).”
      --seneca, ep., 89.]

as you see [[children]] trying to bring a mass of quicksilver to a certain
number of parts, the more they press and [[work]] it and endeavour to reduce
it to their own will, the more they irritate the [[liberty]] of this generous
metal; it evades their endeavour and sprinkles itself into so many
separate bodies [[body]] as frustrate all reckoning; so is it here, for in
subdividing these subtilties we [[teach]] [[men]] to increase their doubts [[doubt]]; they
put us into a way of extending and diversifying difficulties, and
lengthen and disperse them.  in sowing and retailing questions [[question]] they make
the [[world]] fructify and increase in uncertainties and disputes, as the
earth is made fertile by being crumbled and dug deep.

                    “difficultatem facit doctrina.”

               [“learning (doctrine) begets difficulty.”
                --quintilian, insat. orat., x. 3.]

we doubted of ulpian, and are still now more perplexed with bartolus and
baldus.  we should efface the trace of this innumerable [[diversity]] of
opinions; not adorn ourselves with it, and fill [[posterity]] with crotchets.
i [[know]] not what to say to it; but [[experience]] makes it manifest, that so
many interpretations dissipate [[truth]] and break it.  [[aristotle]] wrote to be
understood; if he could not do this, much less will another that is not
so [[good]] at it; and a third than he, who expressed his own thoughts [[thought]].  we
open the matter, and spill it in pouring out: of one [[subject]] we make a
thousand, and in multiplying and subdividing them, fall again into the
infinity of atoms of epicurus.  never did two [[men]] make the same judgment
of the same thing; and ‘tis impossible to find two opinions [[opinion]] exactly
alike, not only in several [[men]], but in the same [[man]], at diverse hours.
i often find matter of [[doubt]] in things of which the commentary has
disdained to take notice; i am most apt to stumble in an even [[country]],
like some horses that i have known, that make most trips in the smoothest
way.

who will not say that glosses augment doubts [[doubt]] and ignorance, since there’s
no [[book]] to be found, either [[human]] or [[divine]], which the [[world]] busies
itself about, whereof the difficulties are cleared by interpretation.
the hundredth commentator passes it on to the next, still more knotty and
perplexed than he found it.  when were we ever agreed amongst ourselves:
“this [[book]] has enough; there is now no more to be said about it”?  this
is most apparent in the [[law]]; we give the [[authority]] of [[law]] to infinite
doctors, infinite decrees, and as many interpretations; yet do we find
any end of the need of interpretating?  is there, for all that, any
progress or advancement towards [[peace]], or do we stand in need of any
fewer advocates and judges [[judge]] than when this [[great]] mass of [[law]] was yet in
its first infancy?  on the contrary, we darken and bury [[intelligence]]; we
can no longer discover it, but at the [[mercy]] of so many fences and
barriers.  [[men]] do not [[know]] the [[natural]] disease of the [[mind]]; it does
nothing but ferret and inquire, and is eternally wheeling, juggling, and
perplexing itself like silkworms, and then suffocates itself in its [[work]];
“mus in pice.”--[“a mouse in a pitch barrel.”]--it thinks [[think]] it discovers
at a [[great]] distance, i [[know]] not what glimpses of [[light]] and imaginary
truth: but whilst running to it, so many difficulties, hindrances, and
new inquisitions cross it, that it loses its way, and is made drunk with
the motion: not much unlike aesop’s dogs, that seeing something like a
dead [[body]] floating in the sea, and not being able to approach it, set to
work to drink the water and lay the passage dry, and so choked
themselves.  to which what one crates’ said of the writings of heraclitus
falls pat enough, “that they required a reader who could swim well,” so
that the depth and weight of his learning might not overwhelm and stifle
him.  ‘tis nothing but particular weakness that makes us content with
what others or ourselves have found out in this chase after [[knowledge]]:
one of [[better]] understanding will not rest so content; there is always
room for one to [[follow]], nay, even for ourselves; and another road; there
is no end of our inquisitions; our end is in the other [[world]].  ‘tis a
sign either that the [[mind]] has grown shortsighted when it is satisfied, or
that it has got weary.  no generous [[mind]] can stop in itself; it will
still tend further and beyond its [[power]]; it has sallies beyond its
effects; if it do not advance and press forward, and retire, and rush and
wheel about, ‘tis but half alive; its pursuits are without bound or
method; its aliment is admiration, the chase, ambiguity, which apollo
sufficiently declared in always speaking to us in a double, obscure, and
oblique sense: not feeding, but amusing and puzzling us.  ‘tis an
irregular and perpetual motion, without model and without aim; its
inventions heat, pursue, and interproduce one another:

estienne de la boetie; thus translated by cotton:

         “so in a running stream one wave we see
          after another roll incessantly,
          and as they glide, each does successively
          pursue the other, each the other fly
          by this that’s evermore pushed on, and this
          by that continually preceded is:
          the water still does into water swill,
          still the same brook, but different water still.”

there is more ado to interpret interpretations than to interpret things,
and more books [[book]] upon books [[book]] than upon any other [[subject]]; we do nothing but
comment upon one another.  every place swarms with commentaries; of
authors there is [[great]] scarcity.  is it not the principal and most
reputed [[knowledge]] of our later ages [[age]] to [[understand]] the learned?  is it not
the [[common]] and final end of all studies?  our opinions [[opinion]] are grafted upon
one another; the first serves as a stock to the second, the second to the
third, and so forth; thus step by step we climb the ladder; whence it
comes to pass that he who is mounted highest has often more [[honour]] than
merit, for he is got up but an inch upon the shoulders of the [[last]], but
one.

how often, and, peradventure, how foolishly, have i extended my [[book]] to
make it speak of itself; foolishly, if for no other [[reason]] but this, that
it should remind me of what i say of others who do the same: that the
frequent amorous glances they cast upon their [[work]] witness that their
hearts pant with self-love, and that even the disdainful severity
wherewith they scourge them are but the dandlings and caressings of
maternal [[love]]; as [[aristotle]], whose valuing and undervaluing himself often
spring from the same air of arrogance.  my own excuse is, that i ought in
this to have more [[liberty]] than others, forasmuch as i write specifically
of myself and of my writings, as i do of my other actions; that my theme
turns upon itself; but i [[know]] not whether others will accept this excuse.

i observed in germany that luther has left as many divisions and disputes
about the [[doubt]] of his opinions [[opinion]], and more, than he himself raised upon
the holy scriptures [[scripture]].  our contest is verbal: i ask what [[nature]] is, what
pleasure, circle, and substitution are?  the [[question]] is about words, and
is answered accordingly.  a stone is a [[body]]; but if a [[man]] should further
urge: “and what is a [[body]]?”--“substance”; “and what is substance?”  and
so on, he would drive the respondent to the end of his calepin.

     [calepin (ambrogio da calepio), a famous lexicographer of the
     fifteenth century.  his polyglot dictionary became so famous, that
     calepin became a [[common]] appellation for a lexicon]

we exchange one word for another, and often for one less understood.
i [[better]] [[know]] what [[man]] is than i [[know]] what animal is, or mortal, or
rational.  to satisfy one [[doubt]], they give me three; ‘tis the hydra’s
head.  [[socrates]] [[asked]] menon, “what [[virtue]] was.”  “there is,” says menon,
“the [[virtue]] of a [[man]] and of a woman, of a magistrate and of a private
person, of an old [[man]] and of a child.”  “very fine,” cried [[socrates]],
“we were in quest of one [[virtue]], and thou hast  brought us a whole
swarm.”  we put one [[question]], and they return us a whole hive.  as no
event, no face, entirely resembles another, so do they not entirely
differ: an ingenious mixture of [[nature]].  if our faces were not alike, we
could not distinguish [[man]] from beast; if they were not unlike, we could
not distinguish one [[man]] from another; all things hold by some similitude;
every [[example]] halts, and the relation which is drawn from [[experience]] is
always faulty and imperfect.  comparisons are ever-coupled at one end or
other: so do the laws [[law]] serve, and are fitted to every one of our affairs,
by some wrested, biassed, and forced interpretation.

since the ethic laws [[law]], that concern the particular [[duty]] of every one in
himself, are so hard to be framed, as we see they are, ‘tis no wonder if
those which govern so many particulars are much more so.  do but consider
the form of this [[justice]] that governs us; ‘tis a true testimony of human
weakness, so full is it of error and contradiction.  what we find to be
favour and severity in justice--and we find so much of them both, that i
know not whether the medium is as often met with are sickly and unjust
members of the very [[body]] and essence of [[justice]].  some [[country]] people
have just brought me news in [[great]] haste, that they presently left in a
forest of mine a [[man]] with a hundred wounds upon him, who was yet
breathing, and begged of them water for pity’s sake, and [[help]] to carry
him to some place of relief; they tell me they durst not go near him, but
have run away, lest the officers of [[justice]] should catch them there; and
as happens to those who are found near a murdered [[person]], they should be
called in [[question]] about this accident, to their utter ruin, having
neither [[money]] nor [[friends]] to defend their innocence.  what could i have
said to these [[people]]?  ‘tis [[certain]] that this office of [[humanity]] would
have brought them into trouble.

how many [[innocent]] [[people]] have we known that have been punished, and this
without the judge’s [[fault]]; and how many that have not arrived at our
knowledge?  this happened in my [[time]]: [[certain]] [[men]] were condemned to die
for a murder committed; their sentence, if not pronounced, at least
determined and concluded on.  the judges [[judge]], just in the nick, are informed
by the officers of an inferior court hard by, that they have some [[men]] in
custody, who have directly confessed the murder, and made an indubitable
discovery of all the particulars of the [[fact]].  yet it was gravely
deliberated whether or not they ought to suspend the execution of the
sentence already passed upon the first accused: they considered the
novelty of the [[example]] judicially, and the consequence of reversing
judgments; that the sentence was passed, and the judges [[judge]] deprived of
repentance; and in the result, these [[poor]] devils [[devil]] were sacrificed by the
forms of [[justice]].  philip, or some other,  provided against a like
inconvenience after this manner.  he had condemned a [[man]] in a [[great]] fine
towards another by an absolute [[judgment]].  the [[truth]] some [[time]] after being
discovered, he found that he had passed an [[unjust]] sentence.  on one side
was the [[reason]] of the cause; on the other side, the [[reason]] of the
judicial forms: he in some sort satisfied both, leaving the sentence in
the [[state]] it was, and out of his own purse recompensing the condemned
party.  but he had to do with a reparable affair; my [[men]] were irreparably
hanged.  how many condemnations have i seen more [[criminal]] than the crimes
themselves?

all which makes me [[remember]] the ancient opinions [[opinion]], “that ‘tis of necessity
a [[man]] must do [[wrong]] by retail who will do [[right]] in gross; and injustice
in little things, who would come to do [[justice]] in [[great]]: that human
justice is formed after the model of physic, according to which, all that
is useful is also just and honest: and of what is held by the stoics,
that [[nature]] herself proceeds contrary to [[justice]] in most of her works [[work]]:
and of what is received by the cyrenaics, that there is nothing just of
itself, but that customs and laws [[law]] make [[justice]]: and what the theodorians
held that theft, sacrilege, and all sorts of uncleanness, are just in a
sage, if he knows [[know]] them to be profitable to him.”  there is no remedy: i
am in the same case that alcibiades was, that i will never, if i can help
it, put myself into the hands of a [[man]] who may determine as to my head,
where my [[life]] and [[honour]] shall more depend upon the [[skill]] and diligence
of my attorney than on my own innocence.  i would venture myself with
such [[justice]] as would take notice of my [[good]] deeds, as well as my ill;
where i had as much to [[hope]] as to [[fear]]: indemnity is not sufficient pay
to a [[man]] who does [[better]] than not to do amiss.  our [[justice]] presents [[present]] to
us but one hand, and that the left hand, too; let him be who he may, he
shall be sure to come off with loss.

in [[china]], of which [[kingdom]] the [[government]] and [[arts]], without commerce with
or [[knowledge]] of ours, surpass our examples [[example]] in several excellent features,
and of which the [[history]] teaches [[teach]] me how much greater and more various the
world is than either the ancients or we have been able to penetrate, the
officers deputed by the [[prince]] to visit the [[state]] of his provinces, as
they punish those who behave themselves ill in their charge, so do they
liberally [[reward]] those who have conducted themselves [[better]] than the
common sort, and beyond the necessity of their [[duty]]; these there present
themselves, not only to be approved but to get; not simply to be paid,
but to have a [[present]] made to them.

no [[judge]], thank [[god]], has ever yet spoken to me in the quality of a [[judge]],
upon any account whatever, whether my own or that of a third party,
whether [[criminal]] or civil; nor no prison has ever received me, not even
to walk there.  [[imagination]] renders the very outside of a jail
displeasing to me; i am so enamoured of [[liberty]], that should i be
interdicted the access to some corner of the indies, i should [[live]] a
little less at my ease; and whilst i can find [[earth]] or air open
elsewhere, i shall never lurk in any place where i must hide myself.
my god!  how ill should i endure the condition wherein i see so many
people, nailed to a corner of the [[kingdom]], deprived of the [[right]] to enter
the principal cities [[city]] and courts, and the [[liberty]] of the [[public]] roads,
for having quarrelled with our laws [[law]].  if those under which i [[live]] should
shake a finger at me by way of menace, i would immediately go seek out
others, let them be where they would.  all my little prudence in the
civil wars [[war]] wherein we are now engaged is employed that they may not
hinder my [[liberty]] of going and coming.

now, the laws [[law]] keep up their credit, not for being just, but because they
are laws [[law]]; ‘tis the mystic foundation of their [[authority]]; they have no
other, and it well answers [[answer]] their [[purpose]].  they are often made by fools [[fool]],
still oftener by [[men]] who, out of [[hatred]] to equality, fail in equity, but
always by [[men]], [[vain]] and irresolute authors.  there is nothing so much,
nor so grossly, nor so ordinarily faulty, as the laws [[law]].  whoever obeys
them because they are just, does not justly obey them as he ought.  our
french laws [[law]], by their irregularity and deformity, lend, in some sort, a
helping hand to the disorder and [[corruption]] that all manifest in their
dispensation and execution: the command is so perplexed and inconstant,
that it in some sort excuses alike disobedience and defect in the
interpretation, the administration and the observation of it.  what fruit
then soever we may extract from [[experience]], that will little advantage
our institution, which we draw from [[foreign]] examples [[example]], if we make so
little [[profit]] of that we have of our own, which is more familiar to us,
and, doubtless, sufficient to instruct us in that whereof we have need.
i study myself more than any other [[subject]]; ‘tis my metaphysic, my
physic:

              “quis deus hanc mundi temperet arte domum:
               qua venit exoriens, qua deficit: unde coactis
               cornibus in plenum menstrua luna redit
               unde salo superant venti, quid flamine captet
               eurus, et in nubes unde perennis aqua;
               sit ventura dies mundi quae subruat arces....”


     [“what [[god]] may govern with [[skill]] this dwelling of the [[world]]?  whence
     rises the monthly moon, whither wanes she?  how is it that her horns
     are contracted and reopen?  whence do winds prevail on the main?
     what does the east wind court with its blasts?  and whence are the
     clouds perpetually supplied with water?  is a day to come which may
     undermine the [[world]]?”--propertius, iii. 5, 26.]

               “quaerite, quos agitat mundi labor.”

     [“ask whom the cares [[care]] of the [[world]] trouble”--lucan, i. 417.]

in this universality, i suffer myself to be ignorantly and negligently
led by the general [[law]] of the [[world]]: i shall [[know]] it well enough when i
feel it; my learning cannot make it alter its course; it will not change
itself for me; ‘tis folly to [[hope]] it, and a greater folly to concern
one’s [[self]] about it, seeing it is necessarily alike [[public]] and [[common]].
the goodness and capacity of the governor ought absolutely to discharge
us of all [[care]] of the [[government]]: philosophical inquisitions and
contemplations serve for no other use but to increase our curiosity.
the [[philosophers]]; with [[great]] [[reason]], send us back to the rules [[rule]] of [[nature]];
but they have nothing to do with so sublime a [[knowledge]]; they falsify
them, and [[present]] us her face painted with too high and too adulterate a
complexion, whence spring so many different pictures of so uniform a
subject.  as she has given us feet to walk with, so has she given us
prudence to guide us in [[life]]: not so ingenious, robust, and pompous a
prudence as that of their invention; but yet one that is easy, quiet, and
salutary, and that very well performs what the other promises, in him who
has the [[good]] [[luck]] to [[know]] how to employ it sincerely and regularly, that
is to say, according to [[nature]].  the most simply to commit one’s [[self]] to
nature is to do it most wisely.  oh, what a soft, easy, and wholesome
pillow is ignorance and incuriosity, whereon to repose a well-ordered
head!

i had rather [[understand]] myself well in myself, than in cicero.  of the
experience i have of myself, i find enough to make me [[wise]], if i were but
a [[good]] scholar: whoever will call to [[mind]] the excess of his [[past]] anger,
and to what a [[degree]] that fever transported him, will see the deformity
of this passion [[better]] than in [[aristotle]], and conceive a more just hatred
against it; whoever will [[remember]] the ills he has undergone, those that
have threatened him, and the [[light]] occasions [[occasion]] that have removed him from
one [[state]] to another, will by that prepare himself for future changes [[change]],
and the [[knowledge]] of his condition.  the [[life]] of caesar has no greater
example for us than our own: though popular and of command, ‘tis still a
life [[subject]] to all [[human]] accidents.  let us but listen to it; we apply
to ourselves all whereof we have principal need; whoever shall call to
memory how many and many times [[time]] he has been mistaken in his own [[judgment]],
is he not a [[great]] [[fool]] if he does not ever after suspect it?  when i find
myself convinced, by the [[reason]] of another, of a false [[opinion]], i do not
so much learn what he has said to me that is new and the particular
ignorance--that would be no [[great]] acquisition--as, in general, i learn my
own debility and the treachery of my understanding, whence i extract the
reformation of the whole mass.  in all my other errors i do the same, and
find from this [[rule]] [[great]] utility to [[life]]; i regard not the [[species]] and
individual as a stone that i have stumbled at; i learn to suspect my
steps throughout, and am careful to place them [[right]].  to learn that a
man has said or done a foolish thing is nothing: a [[man]] must learn that he
is nothing but a [[fool]], a much more ample, and important instruction.  the
false steps that my memory has so often made, even then when it was most
secure and confident of itself, are not idly thrown away; it vainly
swears and assures me i shake my ears; the first opposition that is made
to its testimony puts me into suspense, and i durst not rely upon it in
anything of moment, nor warrant it in another person’s concerns: and were
it not that what i do for want of memory, others do more often for want
of [[good]] [[faith]], i should always, in matter of [[fact]], rather choose to take
the [[truth]] from another’s mouth than from my own.  if every one would pry
into the effects and circumstances of the [[passions]] that sway him, as i
have done into those which i am most [[subject]] to, he would see them
coming, and would a little break their impetuosity and [[career]]; they do
not always seize us on a sudden; there is threatening and degrees

              “fluctus uti primo coepit cum albescere vento,
               paulatim sese tollit mare, et altius undas
               erigit, inde imo consurgit ad aethera fundo.”

     [“as with the first wind the sea begins to foam, and swells, thence
     higher swells, and higher raises the waves, till the ocean rises
     from its depths to the [[sky]].”--aeneid, vii. 528.]

judgment holds in me a magisterial seat; at least it carefully endeavours
to make it so: it leaves my appetites to take their own course, hatred
and [[friendship]], nay, even that i bear to myself, without [[change]] or
corruption; if it cannot reform the other parts according to its own
model, at least it suffers not itself to be corrupted by them, but plays
its game apart.

the [[advice]] to every one, “to [[know]] themselves,” should be of important
effect, since that [[god]] of [[wisdom]] and light’ caused it to be written on
the front of his temple,--[at delphi]--as comprehending all he had to
advise us.  [[plato]] says also, that prudence is no other thing than the
execution of this ordinance; and [[socrates]] minutely verifies it in
xenophon.  the difficulties and obscurity are not discerned in any
science but by those who are got into it; for a [[certain]] [[degree]] of
intelligence is required to be able to [[know]] that a [[man]] knows [[know]] not, and we
must push against a door to [[know]] whether it be bolted against us or no:
whence this platonic subtlety springs, that “neither they who [[know]] are to
enquire, forasmuch as they [[know]]; nor they who do not [[know]], forasmuch as
to inquire they must [[know]] what they inquire of.”  so in this, “of knowing
a man’s [[self]],” that every [[man]] is seen so resolved and satisfied with
himself, that every [[man]] thinks [[think]] himself sufficiently [[intelligent]],
signifies that every one knows [[know]] nothing about the matter; as socrates
gives euthydemus to [[understand]].  i, who profess nothing else, therein
find so infinite a depth and variety, that all the fruit i have reaped
from my learning serves only to make me sensible how much i have to
learn.  to my weakness, so often confessed, i owe the propension i have
to modesty, to the [[obedience]] of [[belief]] prescribed me, to a constant
coldness and moderation of opinions [[opinion]], and a [[hatred]] of that troublesome and
wrangling arrogance, wholly believing and trusting in itself, the capital
enemy of discipline and [[truth]].  do but hear them domineer; the first
fopperies they utter, ‘tis in the style wherewith [[men]] establish religions
and laws [[law]]:

          “nihil est turpius, quam cognitioni et perceptions
          assertionem approbationemque praecurrere.”

     [“nothing is worse than that assertion and decision should precede
     [[knowledge]] and perception.”--cicero, acad., i. 13.]

aristarchus said that anciently there were scarce seven sages to be found
in the [[world]], and in his [[time]] scarce so many fools [[fool]]: have not we more
reason than he to say so in this [[age]] of ours?  affirmation and obstinacy
are express signs of want of wit.  this fellow may have knocked his nose
against the ground a hundred times [[time]] in a day, yet he will be at his ergo’s
as resolute and sturdy as before.  you would say he had had some new soul
and vigour of understanding infused into him since, and that it happened
to him, as to that ancient [[son]] of the [[earth]], who took fresh [[courage]] and
vigour by his fall;

                      “cui cum tetigere parentem,
            jam defecta vigent renovata robore membra:”

     [“whose broken limbs, when they touched his [[mother]] [[earth]],
     immediately new [[force]] acquired.”--lucan, iv. 599.]

does not this incorrigible coxcomb [[think]] that he assumes a new
understanding by undertaking a new dispute?  ‘tis by my own experience
that i accuse [[human]] ignorance, which is, in my [[opinion]], the surest part
of the world’s school.  such as will not conclude it in themselves, by so
vain an [[example]] as mine, or their own, let them [[believe]] it from [[socrates]],
the master of masters; for the philosopher antisthenes said to his
disciples, “let us go and hear [[socrates]]; there i will be a pupil with you”;
and, maintaining this doctrine of the stoic sect, “that [[virtue]] was
sufficient to make a [[life]] completely [[happy]], having no need of any other
thing whatever”; except of the [[force]] of [[socrates]], added he.

that long attention that i employ in considering myself, also fits rile
to [[judge]] tolerably enough of others; and there are few things whereof i
speak [[better]] and with [[better]] excuse.  i happen very often more exactly to
see and distinguish the qualities of my [[friends]] than they do themselves:
i have astonished some with the pertinence of my description, and have
given them warning of themselves.  by having from my infancy been
accustomed to contemplate my own [[life]] in those of others, i have acquired
a [[complexion]] studious in that particular; and when i am once interit upon
it, i let few things about me, whether countenances, humours [[humour]],
or discourses, that serve to that [[purpose]], escape me.  i study all,
both what i am to avoid and what i am to [[follow]].  also in my [[friends]],
i discover by their productions their inward inclinations; not by
arranging this infinite variety of so diverse and unconnected actions
into [[certain]] [[species]] and chapters [[chapter]], and distinctly distributing my parcels
and divisions under known heads and classes;

          “sed neque quam multae [[species]], nec nomina quae sint,
          est numerus.”

     [“but neither can we enumerate how many kinds [[kind]] there what are their
     names.”--virgil, georg., ii. 103.]

the [[wise]] speak and deliver their fancies more specifically, and piece by
piece; i, who see no further into things than as use informs me, present
mine generally without [[rule]] and experimentally: i pronounce my [[opinion]] by
disjointed articles, as a thing that cannot be spoken at once and in
gross; relation and conformity are not to be found in such low and common
souls as ours.  [[wisdom]] is a solid and entire building, of which every
piece keeps its place and bears its mark:

               “sola sapientia in se tota conversa est.”

     [“wisdom only is wholly within itself”--cicero, de fin., iii. 7.]

i leave it to artists, and i [[know]] not whether or no they will be able to
bring it about, in so perplexed, minute, and fortuitous a thing, to
marshal into distinct bodies [[body]] this infinite [[diversity]] of faces, to settle
our inconstancy, and set it in order.  i do not only find it hard to
piece our actions to one another, but i moreover find it hard properly to
design each by itself by any principal quality, so ambiguous and variform
they are with diverse lights [[light]].  that which is remarked for rare in
perseus, [[king]] of macedon, “that his [[mind]], fixing itself to no one
condition, wandered in all sorts of living, and represented manners so
wild and erratic that it was neither known to himself or any other what
kind of [[man]] he was,” seems almost to fit all the [[world]]; and, especially,
i have seen another of his make, to whom i [[think]] this conclusion might
more properly be applied; no moderate settledness, still running headlong
from one extreme to another, upon occasions [[occasion]] not to be guessed at; no line
of path without traverse and wonderful contrariety: no one quality simple
and unmixed; so that the [[best]] guess [[men]] can one day make will be, that he
affected and [[studied]] to make himself known by being not to be known.  a
man had need have sound ears to hear himself frankly criticised; and as
there are few who can endure to hear it without being nettled, those who
hazard the undertaking it to us manifest a singular effect of [[friendship]];
for ‘tis to [[love]] sincerely indeed, to venture to wound and offend us, for
our own [[good]].  i [[think]] it harsh to [[judge]] a [[man]] whose ill qualities are
more than his [[good]] ones: [[plato]] requires three things in him who will
examine the [[soul]] of another: [[knowledge]], benevolence, boldness.

i was sometimes [[asked]], what i should have [[thought]] myself fit for, had any
one designed to make use of me, while i was of suitable years:

         “dum melior vires sanguis dabat, aemula necdum
          temporibus geminis canebat sparsa senectus:”

     [“whilst [[better]] [[blood]] gave me vigour, and before envious old age
     whitened and thinned my temples.”--aeneid, v. 415.]

“for nothing,” said i; and i willingly excuse myself from knowing
anything which enslaves me to others.  but i had told the [[truth]] to my
master,--[was this henri vi.?  d.w.]--and had regulated his manners, if
he had so pleased, not in gross, by scholastic lessons, which i
understand not, and from which i see no true reformation spring in those
that do; but by observing them by leisure, at all opportunities, and
simply and naturally judging them as an eye-witness, distinctly one by
one; giving him to [[understand]] upon what terms he was in the common
opinion, in opposition to his flatterers.  there is none of us who would
not be worse than kings [[king]], if so continually corrupted as they are with
that sort of canaille.  how, if alexander, that [[great]] [[king]] and
philosopher, cannot defend himself from them!

i should have had fidelity, [[judgment]], and [[freedom]] enough for that
purpose.  it would be a nameless office, otherwise it would lose its
grace and its effect; and ‘tis a part that is not indifferently fit for
all [[men]]; for [[truth]] itself has not the [[privilege]] to be spoken at all times
and indiscriminately; its use, [[noble]] as it is, has its circumspections
and limits.  it often falls out, as the [[world]] goes, that a [[man]] lets it
slip into the ear of a [[prince]], not only to no [[purpose]], but moreover
injuriously and unjustly; and no [[man]] shall make me [[believe]] that a
virtuous remonstrance may not be viciously applied, and that the interest
of the substance is not often to give way to that of the form.

for such a [[purpose]], i would  have a [[man]] who is content with his own
fortune:

               “quod sit, esse velit, nihilque malit,”

          [“who is pleased with what he is and desires [[desire]] nothing further.”
           --martial, x. ii, 18.]

and of moderate station; forasmuch as, on the one hand, he would not be
afraid to touch his master’s [[heart]] to the quick, for [[fear]] by that means
of losing his preferment: and, on the other hand, being of no high
quality, he would have more easy communication with all sorts of [[people]].
i would have this office limited to only one [[person]]; for to allow the
privilege of his [[liberty]] and privacy to many, would beget an inconvenient
irreverence; and of that one, i would above all things require the
fidelity of [[silence]].

a [[king]] is not to be believed when he brags of his constancy in standing
the shock of the [[enemy]] for his [[glory]], if for his [[profit]] and amendment he
cannot stand the [[liberty]] of a friend’s [[advice]], which has no other power
but to pinch his ear, the remainder of its effect being still in his own
hands.  now, there is no condition of [[men]] whatever who stand in so great
need of true and [[free]] [[advice]] and warning, as they do: they sustain a
public [[life]], and have to satisfy the [[opinion]] of so many spectators, that,
as those about them conceal from them whatever should divert them from
their own way, they insensibly find themselves involved in the [[hatred]] and
detestation of their [[people]], often upon occasions [[occasion]] which they might have
avoided without any prejudice even of their pleasures [[pleasure]] themselves, had
they been advised and set [[right]] in [[time]].  their favourites commonly have
more regard to themselves than to their master; and indeed it answers
with them, forasmuch as, in [[truth]], most offices of real [[friendship]], when
applied to the [[sovereign]], are under a rude and dangerous hazard, so that
therein there is [[great]] need, not only of very [[great]] affection and
freedom, but of [[courage]] too.

in fine, all this hodge-podge which i scribble here, is nothing but a
register of the essays of my own [[life]], which, for the internal soundness,
is exemplary enough to take instruction against the grain; but as to
bodily health, no [[man]] can furnish out more profitable [[experience]] than i,
who [[present]] it pure, and no way corrupted and changed by art [[arts]] or [[opinion]].
experience is properly upon its own dunghill in the [[subject]] of physic,
where [[reason]] wholly gives it place: tiberius said that whoever had lived
twenty years ought to be responsible to himself for all things that were
hurtful or wholesome to him, and [[know]] how to order himself without
physic;

     [all that suetonius says in his [[life]] of tiberius is that this
     [[emperor]], after he was thirty years old, governed his health without
     the aid of physicians; and what plutarch tells us, in his essay on
     the rules [[rule]] and precepts of health, is that tiberius said that the man
     who, having attained sixty years, held out his pulse to a physician
     was a [[fool]].]

and he might have learned it of [[socrates]], who, advising his disciples to
be solicitous of their health as a [[chief]] study, added that it was hard if
a [[man]] of sense, having a [[care]] to his exercise and diet, did not better
know than any physician what was [[good]] or ill for him.  and physic itself
professes always to have [[experience]] for the test of its operations: so
plato had [[reason]] to say that, to be a [[right]] physician, it would be
necessary that he who would become such, should first himself have passed
through all the diseases he pretends to cure, and through all the
accidents and circumstances whereof he is to [[judge]].  ‘tis but [[reason]] they
should get the pox, if they will [[know]] how to cure it; for my part,
i should put myself into such hands; the others but guide us, like him
who paints seas and rocks and ports sitting at table, and there makes the
model of a ship sailing in all security; but put him to the [[work]] itself,
he knows [[know]] not at which end to begin.  they make such a description of our
maladies as a town crier does of a lost horse or dog--such a color, such
a height, such an ear--but bring it to him and he knows [[know]] it not, for all
that.  if physic should one day give me some [[good]] and visible relief,
then truly i will cry out in [[good]] earnest:

               “tandem effcaci do manus scientiae.”

     [“show me and efficacious [[science]], and i will take it by the hand.”
      --horace, xvii. i.]

the [[arts]] that promise to keep our bodies [[body]] and souls [[soul]] in health promise a
great deal; but, withal, there are none that less keep their promise.
and, in our [[time]], those who make profession of these [[arts]] amongst us,
less manifest the effects than any other sort of [[men]]; one may say of
them, at the most, that they sell medicinal drugs; but that they are
physicians, a [[man]] cannot say.

     [the edition of 1588 adds: “judging by themselves, and those
     who are ruled by them.”]

i have lived long enough to be able to give an account of the custom that
has carried me so far; for him who has a [[mind]] to try it, as his taster,
i have made the experiment.  here are some of the articles, as my memory
shall supply me with them; i have no custom that has not varied according
to circumstances; but i only record those that i have been best
acquainted with, and that hitherto have had the [[greatest]] possession of
me.

my form of [[life]] is the same in sickness as in health; the same bed, the
same hours, the same meat, and even the same drink, serve me in both
conditions alike; i add nothing to them but the moderation of more or
less, according to my [[strength]] and appetite.  my health is to maintain my
wonted [[state]] without disturbance.  i see that sickness puts me off it on
one side, and if i will be ruled by the physicians, they will put me off
on the other; so that by [[fortune]] and by art [[arts]] i am out of my way.
i [[believe]] nothing more certainly than this, that i cannot be hurt by the
use of things to which i have been so long accustomed.  ‘tis for custom
to give a form to a man’s [[life]], such as it pleases him; she is all in all
in that: ‘tis the potion of circe, that varies our [[nature]] as she best
pleases.  how many nations, and but three steps from us, [[think]] the fear
of the night-dew, that so manifestly is hurtful to us, a ridiculous
fancy; and our own watermen and peasants laugh at it.  you make a german
sick if you lay him upon a mattress, as you do an italian if you lay him
on a feather-bed, and a frenchman, if without curtains or [[fire]]. a spanish
stomach cannot hold out to [[eat]] as we can, nor ours to drink like the
swiss.  a [[german]] made me very merry at augsburg, by finding [[fault]] with
our hearths, by the same arguments which we commonly make use of in
decrying their stoves: for, to say the [[truth]], the smothered heat, and
then the smell of that heated matter of which the [[fire]] is composed, very
much offend such as are not used to them; not me; and, indeed, the heat
being always [[equal]], constant, and universal, without flame, without
smoke, and without the wind that comes down our chimneys, they may many
ways sustain comparison with ours.  why do we not imitate the roman
architecture? for they say that anciently fires [[fire]] were not made in the
houses, but on the outside, and at the foot of them, whence the heat was
conveyed to the whole fabric by pipes contrived in the wall, which were
drawn twining about the rooms that were to be warmed: which i have seen
plainly described somewhere in seneca.  this [[german]] hearing me commend
the conveniences and beauties [[beauty]] of his [[city]], which truly deserves it, began
to compassionate me that i had to leave it; and the first inconvenience
he alleged to me was, the heaviness of head that the chimneys elsewhere
would bring upon me.  he had heard some one make this complaint, and
fixed it upon us, being by custom deprived of the means of perceiving it
at [[home]].  all heat that comes from the [[fire]] weakens and dulls me.  evenus
said that [[fire]] was the [[best]] condiment of [[life]]: i rather choose any other
way of making myself warm.

we are afraid to drink our wines, when toward the bottom of the cask; in
portugal those fumes are reputed delicious, and it is the beverage of
princes.  in short, every nation has many customs and usages that are not
only unknown to other nations, but savage and miraculous in their sight.
what should we do with those [[people]] who admit of no evidence that is not
in print, who [[believe]] not [[men]] if they are not in a [[book]], nor [[truth]] if it
be not of competent [[age]]? we dignify our fopperies when we commit them to
the press: ‘tis of a [[great]] deal more weight to say, “i have [[read]] such a
thing,” than if you only say, “i have heard such a thing.”  but i, who no
more disbelieve a man’s mouth than his pen, and who [[know]] that [[men]] write
as indiscreetly as they speak, and who look upon this [[age]] as one that is
past, as soon quote a friend as aulus gelliusor macrobius; and what i
have seen, as what they have written.  and, as ‘tis held of [[virtue]], that
it is not greater for having continued longer, so do i hold of [[truth]],
that for being older it is none the wiser.  i often say, that it is mere
folly that makes us run after [[foreign]] and scholastic examples [[example]]; their
fertility is the same now that it was in the [[time]] of [[homer]] and [[plato]].
but is it not that we seek more [[honour]] from the quotation, than from the
truth of the matter in hand?  as if it were more to the [[purpose]] to borrow
our proofs from the shops of vascosan or plantin, than from what is to be
seen in our own village; or else, indeed, that we have not the wit to
cull out and make useful what we see before us, and to [[judge]] of it
clearly enough to draw it into [[example]]: for if we say that we want
authority to give [[faith]] to our testimony, we speak from the [[purpose]];
forasmuch as, in my [[opinion]], of the most ordinary, [[common]], and known
things, could we but find out their [[light]], the [[greatest]] [[miracles]] of
nature might be formed, and the most wonderful examples [[example]], especially upon
the [[subject]] of [[human]] actions.

now, upon this [[subject]], setting aside the examples [[example]] i have gathered from
books, and what [[aristotle]] says of andron the argian, that he travelled
over the arid sands of lybia without drinking: a gentleman, who has very
well behaved himself in several employments, said, in a place where i
was, that he had ridden from madrid to lisbon, in the heat of summer,
without any drink at all.  he is very healthful and vigorous for his [[age]],
and has nothing extraordinary in the use of his [[life]], but this, to live
sometimes two or three months, nay, a whole year, as he has told me,
without drinking.  he is sometimes thirsty, but he lets it pass over,
and he holds that it is an appetite which easily goes off of itself;
and he drinks more out of caprice than either for need or [[pleasure]].

here is another [[example]]: ‘tis not long ago that i found one of the
learnedest [[men]] in [[france]], among those of not inconsiderable [[fortune]],
studying in a corner of a hall that they had separated for him with
tapestry, and about him a rabble of his servants full of licence.  he
told me, and seneca almost says the same of himself,  he made an
advantage of this hubbub; that, beaten with this noise, he so much
the more collected and retired himself into himself for contemplation,
and that this tempest of voices drove back his thoughts [[thought]] within himself.
being a student at padua, he had his study so long situated amid the
rattle of coaches and the tumult of the square, that he not only formed
himself to the contempt, but even to the use of noise, for the service of
his studies.  [[socrates]] answered alcibiades, who was astonished how he
could endure the perpetual scolding of his [[wife]], “why,” said he, “as
those do who are accustomed to the ordinary noise of wheels drawing
water.”  i am quite otherwise; i have a tender head and easily
discomposed; when ‘tis bent upon anything, the least buzzing of a fly
murders it.

seneca in his [[youth]] having warmly espoused the [[example]] of sextius, of
eating nothing that had died, for a whole year dispensed with such food,
and, as he said, with [[pleasure]], and discontinued it that he might not be
suspected of taking up this [[rule]] from some new [[religion]] by which it was
prescribed: he adopted, in like manner, from the precepts of attalus a
custom not to [[lie]] upon any sort of bedding that gave way under his
weight, and, even to his old [[age]], made use of such as would not yield to
any pressure.  what the usage of his [[time]] made him account roughness,
that of ours makes us look upon as effeminacy.

do but observe the difference betwixt the way of living of my labourers
and my own; the scythians and indians [[indian]] have nothing more remote both from
my capacity and my form.  i have picked up charity  boys to serve me: who
soon after have quitted both my kitchen and livery, only that they might
return to their former course of [[life]]; and i found one afterwards,
picking mussels out of the sewer for his dinner, whom i could neither by
entreaties nor threats reclaim from the sweetness he found in indigence.
beggars have their magnificences and delights, as well as the [[rich]], and,
‘tis said, their dignities and polities.  these are the effects of
custom; she can mould us, not only into what form she pleases (the sages
say we ought to apply ourselves to the [[best]], which she will soon make
easy to us), but also to [[change]] and variation, which is the most noble
and most useful instruction of all she teaches [[teach]] us.  the [[best]] of my bodily
conditions is that i am flexible and not very obstinate: i have
inclinations more my own and ordinary, and more agreeable than others;
but i am diverted from them with very little ado, and easily slip into a
contrary course.  a [[young]] [[man]] ought to cross his own rules [[rule]], to awaken his
vigour and to keep it from growing faint and rusty; and there is no
course of [[life]] so [[weak]] and sottish as that which is carried on by rule
and discipline;

         “ad primum lapidem vectari quum placet, hora
          sumitur ex libro; si prurit frictus ocelli
          angulus, inspecta genesi, collyria quaerit;”

     [“when he is pleased to have himself carried to the first milestone,
     the hour is chosen from the almanac; if he but rub the corner of his
     eye, his horoscope having been examined, he seeks the aid of
     salves.”---juvenal, vi. 576.]

he shall often throw himself even into excesses, if he will take my
advice; otherwise the least debauch will [[destroy]] him, and render him
troublesome and disagreeable in company.  the worst quality in a
well-bred [[man]] is over-fastidiousness, and an obligation to a certain
particular way; and it is particular, if not pliable and supple.  it is a
kind of reproach, not to be able, or not to dare, to do what we see those
about us do; let such as these stop at [[home]].  it is in every man
unbecoming, but in a soldier vicious and intolerable: who, as philopcemen
said, ought to accustom himself to every variety and inequality of [[life]].

though i have been brought up, as much as was possible, to [[liberty]] and
independence, yet so it is that, growing old, and having by indifference
more settled upon [[certain]] forms (my [[age]] is now [[past]] instruction, and has
henceforward nothing to do but to keep itself up as well as it can),
custom has already, ere i was aware, so imprinted its [[character]] in me in
certain things, that i look upon it as a [[kind]] of excess to leave them
off; and, without a [[force]] upon myself, cannot sleep in the daytime, nor
eat between meals, nor breakfast, nor go to bed, without a [[great]] interval
betwixt eating and sleeping,--[gastroesophogeal reflux. d.w.]--as of
three hours after supper; nor get [[children]] but before i sleep, nor get
them standing; nor endure my own sweat; nor quench my thirst either with
pure water or pure wine; nor keep my head long bare, nor cut my hair
after dinner; and i should be as uneasy without my gloves as without my
shirt, or without washing when i rise from table or out of my bed; and i
could not [[lie]] without a canopy and curtains, as if they were essential
things.  i could dine without a tablecloth, but without a clean napkin,
after the [[german]] [[fashion]], very incommodiously; i foul them more than the
germans or italians do, and make but little use either of spoon or fork.
i [[complain]] that they did not keep up the [[fashion]], begun after the example
of kings [[king]], to [[change]] our napkin at every service, as they do our plate.
we are told of that laborious soldier marius that, growing old, he became
nice in his drink, and never drank but out of a particular cup of his own
i, in like manner, have [[suffered]] myself to fancy a [[certain]] form of
glasses, and not willingly to drink in [[common]] glasses, no more than from
a [[strange]] [[common]] hand: all metal offends me in comparison of a clear and
transparent matter: let my [[eyes]] taste, too, according to their capacity.
i owe several other such niceties to custom.  [[nature]] has also, on the
other side, helped me to some of hers: as not to be able to endure more
than two full meals in one day, without overcharging my stomach, nor a
total abstinence from one of those meals without filling myself with
wind, drying up my mouth, and dulling my appetite; the finding great
inconvenience from overmuch evening air; for of late years, in night
marches, which often happen to be all night long, after five or six hours
my stomach begins to be queasy, with a [[violent]] [[pain]] in my head, so that i
always vomit before the day can break.  when the others go to breakfast,
i go to sleep; and when i rise, i am as brisk and [[gay]] as before.  i had
always been told that the night dew never rises but in the beginning of
the night; but for some years [[past]], long and familiar intercourse with
a [[lord]], possessed with the [[opinion]] that the night dew is more sharp and
dangerous about the declining of the sun, an hour or two before it sets,
which he carefully avoids, and despises that of the night, he almost
impressed upon me, not so much his reasoning as his experiences.  what,
shall mere [[doubt]] and inquiry strike our [[imagination]], so as to [[change]] us?
such as absolutely and on a sudden give way to these propensions, draw
total destruction upon themselves. i am [[sorry]] for several gentlemen who,
through the folly of their physicians, have in their [[youth]] and health
wholly shut themselves up: it were [[better]] to endure a cough, than, by
disuse, for ever to lose the commerce of [[common]] [[life]] in things of so
great utility.  malignant [[science]], to interdict us the most pleasant
hours of the day!  let us keep our possession to the [[last]]; for the most
part, a [[man]] hardens himself by being obstinate, and corrects his
constitution, as caesar did the falling sickness, by dint of contempt.
a [[man]] should addict himself to the [[best]] rules [[rule]], but not enslave himself to
them, except to such, if there be any such, where obligation and
servitude are of [[profit]].

both kings [[king]] and [[philosophers]] go to stool, and ladies [[lady]] too; [[public]] lives [[life]] are
bound to [[ceremony]]; mine, that is obscure and private, enjoys all natural
dispensation; soldier and gascon are also qualities a little [[subject]] to
indiscretion; wherefore i shall say of this act of relieving [[nature]], that
it is desirable to refer it to [[certain]] prescribed and nocturnal hours,
and compel one’s [[self]] to this by custom, as i have done; but not to
subject one’s [[self]], as i have done in my declining years, to a particular
convenience of place and seat for that [[purpose]], and make it troublesome
by long sitting; and yet, in the fouler offices, is it not in some
measure excusable to require more [[care]] and cleanliness?

          “naturt homo mundum et elegans animal est.”

     [“man is by [[nature]] a clean and delicate creature.”--seneca, ep., 92.]

of all the actions of [[nature]], i am the most impatient of being
interrupted in that.  i have seen many soldiers troubled with the
unruliness of their bellies; whereas mine and i never fail of our
punctual assignation, which is at leaping out of bed, if some
indispensable [[business]] or sickness does not molest us.

i [[think]] then, as i said before, that sick [[men]] cannot [[better]] place
themselves anywhere in more safety, than in sitting still in that course
of [[life]] wherein they have been bred and trained up; [[change]], be it what it
will, distempers and puts one out.  do you [[believe]] that chestnuts can
hurt a perigordin or a lucchese, or milk and cheese the mountain [[people]]?
we enjoin them not only a new, but a contrary, method of [[life]]; a change
that the healthful cannot endure.  prescribe water to a breton of
threescore and ten; shut a seaman up in a stove; forbid a basque footman
to walk: you will deprive them of motion, and in the end of air and
light:

              “an vivere tanti est?
               cogimur a suetis animum suspendere rebus,
               atque, ut vivamus, vivere desinimus.  .
               hos superesse reor, quibus et spirabilis aer
               et lux, qua regimur, redditur ipsa gravis.”

     [“is [[life]] worth so much?  we are compelled to withhold the mind
     from things to which we are accustomed; and, that we may [[live]], we
     cease to [[live]] .  .  .  .  do i conceive that they still [[live]], to
     whom the respirable air, and the [[light]] itself, by which we are
     governed, is rendered oppressive?”
      --pseudo-gallus, eclog., i. 155, 247.]

if they do no other [[good]], they do this at least, that they prepare
patients betimes for [[death]], by little and little undermining and cutting
off the use of [[life]].

both well and sick, i have ever willingly [[suffered]] myself to obey the
appetites that pressed upon me.  i give [[great]] rein to my desires [[desire]] and
propensities; i do not [[love]] to cure one disease by another; i hate
remedies that are more troublesome than the disease itself.  to be
subject to the colic and [[subject]] to abstain from eating oysters are two
evils instead of one; the disease torments us on the one side, and the
remedy on the other.  since we are ever in danger of mistaking, let us
rather run the hazard of a mistake, after we have had the [[pleasure]].  the
world proceeds quite the other way, and thinks [[think]] nothing profitable that is
not painful; it has [[great]] suspicion of facility.  my appetite, in various
things, has of its own accord happily enough accommodated itself to the
health of my stomach.  relish and pungency in sauces were pleasant to me
when [[young]]; my stomach disliking them since, my taste incontinently
followed.  wine is hurtful to sick [[people]], and ‘tis the first thing that
my mouth then finds distasteful, and with an invincible dislike.
whatever i take against my liking does me harm; and nothing hurts me that
i [[eat]] with appetite and delight.  i never received harm by any action
that was very pleasant to me; and accordingly have made all medicinal
conclusions largely give way to my [[pleasure]]; and i have, when i was
young,

         “quem circumcursans huc atque huc saepe cupido
          fulgebat crocink splendidus in tunic.”

     [“when cupid, fluttering round me here and there, shone in his rich
     purple mantle.”--catullus, lxvi. 133.]

given myself the rein as licentiously and inconsiderately to the desire
that was predominant in me, as any other whomsoever:

                    “et militavi non sine gloria;”

          [“and i have played the soldier not ingloriously.”
           --horace, od., iii.  26, 2.]

yet more in continuation and holding out, than in sally:

               “sex me vix memini sustinuisse vices [[vice]].”

          [“i can scarcely [[remember]] six bouts in one night”
           --ovid, amor., iii. 7, 26.]

‘tis certainly a misfortune and a miracle at once to confess at what a
tender [[age]] i first came under the subjection of [[love]]: it was, indeed, by
chance; for it was long before the years of [[choice]] or [[knowledge]]; i do not
remember myself so far back; and my [[fortune]] may well be coupled with that
of quartilla, who could not [[remember]] when she was a maid:

         “inde tragus, celeresque pili, mirandaque matri
          barba meae.”

     [“thence the odour of the arm-pits, the precocious hair, and the
     beard which astonished my [[mother]].”--martial, xi. 22, 7.]

physicians modify their rules [[rule]] according to the [[violent]] longings that
happen to sick persons [[person]], ordinarily with [[good]] [[success]]; this [[great]] desire
cannot be imagined so [[strange]] and vicious, but that [[nature]] must have a
hand in it.  and then how easy a thing is it to satisfy the fancy?  in my
opinion; this part wholly carries it, at least, above all the rest.  the
most grievous and ordinary evils [[evil]] are those that fancy loads us with; this
spanish saying pleases me in several aspects:

                  “defenda me dios de me.”

               [“god defend me from myself.”]

i am [[sorry]] when i am sick, that i have not some longing that might give
me the [[pleasure]] of satisfying it; all the rules [[rule]] of physic would hardly be
able to divert me from it.  i do the same when i am well; i can see very
little more to be hoped or wished for.  ‘twere [[pity]] a [[man]] should be so
weak and languishing, as not to have even wishing left to him.

the art [[arts]] of physic is not so fixed, that we need be without [[authority]] for
whatever we do; it changes [[change]] according to climates and moons, according to
fernel and to scaliger.--[physicians to henry ii.]--if your physician
does not [[think]] it [[good]] for you to sleep, to drink wine, or to [[eat]] such
and such meats, never trouble yourself; i will find you another that
shall not be of his [[opinion]]; the [[diversity]] of medical arguments and
opinions embraces all sorts and forms.  i saw a miserable sick person
panting and burning for thirst, that he might be cured, who was
afterwards laughed at for his pains [[pain]] by another physician, who condemned
that [[advice]] as prejudicial to him: had he not tormented himself to good
purpose?  there lately died of the stone a [[man]] of that profession, who
had made use of extreme abstinence to contend with his disease: his
fellow-physicians say that, on the contrary, this abstinence had dried
him up and baked the gravel in his kidneys.

i have observed, that both in wounds and sicknesses, speaking discomposes
and hurts me, as much as any irregularity i can commit.  my voice pains
and tires me, for ‘tis loud and forced; so that when i have gone to a
whisper some [[great]] persons [[person]] about affairs of consequence, they have often
desired me to moderate my voice.

this story is worth a diversion.  some one in a [[certain]] [[greek]] school
speaking loud as i do, the master of the ceremonies [[ceremony]] sent to him to speak
softly: “tell him, then, he must send me,” replied the other, “the tone
he would have me speak in.”  to which the other replied, “that he should
take the tone from the ears of him to whom he spake.”  it was well said,
if it is to be understood: “speak according to the affair you are
speaking about to your auditor,” for if it mean, “‘tis sufficient that he
hear you, or govern yourself by him,” i do not find it to be [[reason]].  the
tone and motion of my voice carries with it a [[great]] deal of the
expression and signification of my meaning, and ‘tis i who am to govern
it, to make myself understood: there is a voice to instruct, a voice to
flatter, and a voice to reprehend.  i will not only that my voice reach
him, but, peradventure, that it strike and pierce him.  when i rate my
valet with sharp and bitter [[language]], it would be very pretty for him to
say; “pray, master, speak lower; i hear you very well”:

               “est quaedam vox ad auditum accommodata,
               non magnitudine, sed proprietate.”

     [“there is a [[certain]] voice accommodated to the hearing, not by its
     loudness, but by its propriety.”--quintilian, xi. 3.]

speaking is half his who speaks, and half his who hears; the latter
ought to prepare himself to receive it, according to its bias; as with
tennis-players, he who receives the ball, shifts and prepares, according
as he sees him move who strikes the stroke, and according to the stroke
itself.

experience has, moreover, taught me this, that we ruin ourselves by
impatience.  evils [[evil]] have their [[life]] and limits, their diseases and their
recovery.

the [[constitution]] of maladies is formed by the pattern of the constitution
of animals; they have their [[fortune]] and their days limited from their
birth; he who attempts imperiously to cut them short by [[force]] in the
middle of their course, lengthens and multiplies them, and incenses
instead of appeasing them.  i am of crantor’s [[opinion]], that we are
neither obstinately and deafly to oppose evils [[evil]], nor succumb to them from
want of [[courage]]; but that we are naturally to give way to them, according
to their condition and our own.  we ought to grant [[free]] passage to
diseases; i find they stay less with me, who let them alone; and i have
lost some, reputed the most tenacious and obstinate, by their own decay,
without [[help]] and without art [[arts]], and contrary to its rules [[rule]].  let us a little
permit [[nature]] to take her own way; she [[better]] understands her own affairs
than we.  but such an one died of it; and so shall you: if not of that
disease, of another.  and how many have not escaped dying, who have had
three physicians at their tails?  [[example]] is a vague and universal
mirror, and of various reflections.  if it be a delicious medicine, take
it: ‘tis always so much [[present]] [[good]].  i will never stick at the name nor
the colour, if it be pleasant and grateful to the palate: [[pleasure]] is one
of the chiefest kinds [[kind]] of [[profit]].  i have [[suffered]] colds, gouty
defluxions, relaxations, palpitations of the [[heart]], megrims, and other
accidents, to grow old and [[die]] in [[time]] a [[natural]] [[death]].  i have so lost
them when i was half fit to keep them: they are sooner prevailed upon by
courtesy than huffing.  we must patiently suffer the laws [[law]] of our
condition; we are born to grow old, to grow [[weak]], and to be sick, in
despite of all medicine.  ‘tis the first lesson the mexicans [[teach]] their
children; so soon as ever they are born they thus salute them: “thou art
come into the [[world]], child, to endure: endure, suffer, and say nothing.”
 ‘tis [[injustice]] to lament that which has befallen any one which may befall
every one:

     “indignare, si quid in to inique proprio constitutum est.”

     [“then be angry, when there is anything unjustly decreed against
     thee alone.”--seneca, ep., 91.]

see an old [[man]] who begs of [[god]] that he will maintain his health vigorous
and entire; that is to say, that he restore him to [[youth]]:

          “stulte, quid haec frustra votis puerilibus optas?”

          [“fool!  why do you vainly form these puerile wishes [[wish]]?”
           --ovid., trist., 111. 8, ii.]

is it not folly?  his condition is not capable of it.  the gout, the
stone, and indigestion are symptoms of long years; as heat, rains, and
winds are of long journeys.  [[plato]] does not [[believe]] that aesculapius
troubled himself to provide by regimen to prolong [[life]] in a [[weak]] and
wasted [[body]], useless to his [[country]] and to his profession, or to beget
healthful and robust [[children]]; and does not [[think]] this [[care]] suitable to
the [[divine]] [[justice]] and prudence, which is to direct all things to
utility.  my [[good]] friend, your [[business]] is done; nobody can restore you;
they can, at the most, but patch you up, and prop you a little, and by
that means prolong your misery an hour or two:

              “non secus instantem cupiens fulcire ruinam,
               diversis contra nititur obiicibus;
               donec certa dies, omni compage soluta,
               ipsum cum rebus subruat auxilium.”

     [“like one who, desiring to stay an impending ruin, places various
     props against it, till, in a short [[time]], the house, the props, and
     all, giving way, fall together.”--pseudo-gallus, i. 171.]

we must learn to suffer what we cannot evade; our [[life]], like the harmony
of the [[world]], is composed of contrary things--of diverse tones, sweet and
harsh, sharp and flat, sprightly and solemn: the musician who should only
affect some of these, what would he be able to do?  he must [[know]] how to
make use of them all, and to mix them; and so we should mingle the goods
and evils [[evil]] which are consubstantial with our [[life]]; our being cannot
subsist without this mixture, and the one part is no less necessary to it
than the other.  to attempt to combat [[natural]] necessity, is to represent
the folly of ctesiphon, who undertook to kick with his mule.--[plutarch,
how to restrain anger, c. 8.]

i consult little about the alterations i [[feel]]: for these doctors take
advantage; when they have you at their [[mercy]], they surfeit your ears with
their prognostics; and formerly surprising me, weakened with sickness,
injuriously handled me with their dogmas and magisterial fopperies--one
while menacing me with [[great]] pains [[pain]], and another with approaching [[death]].
hereby i was indeed moved and shaken, but not subdued nor jostled from my
place; and though my [[judgment]] was neither altered nor distracted, yet it
was at least disturbed: ‘tis always agitation and combat.

now, i use my [[imagination]] as gently as i can, and would discharge it, if
i could, of all trouble and contest; a [[man]] must assist, flatter, and
deceive it, if he can; my [[mind]] is fit for that office; it needs no
appearances throughout: could it persuade as it preaches, it would
successfully relieve me.  will you have an [[example]]?  it tells me: “that
‘tis for my [[good]] to have the stone: that the structure of my [[age]] must
naturally suffer some decay, and it is now [[time]] it should begin to
disjoin and to confess a breach; ‘tis a [[common]] necessity, and there is
nothing in it either miraculous or new; i therein [[pay]] what is due to old
age, and i cannot expect a [[better]] bargain; that [[society]] ought to comfort
me, being fallen into the most [[common]] infirmity of my [[age]]; i see
everywhere [[men]] tormented with the same disease, and am honoured by the
fellowship, forasmuch as [[men]] of the [[best]] quality are most frequently
afflicted with it: ‘tis a [[noble]] and dignified disease: that of such as
are struck with it, few have it to a less [[degree]] of [[pain]]; that these are
put to the trouble of a strict diet and the daily taking of nauseous
potions, whereas i owe my [[better]] [[state]] purely to my [[good]] [[fortune]]; for
some ordinary broths of eringo or burst-wort that i have twice or thrice
taken to oblige the ladies [[lady]], who, with greater [[kindness]] than my [[pain]] was
sharp, would needs [[present]] me half of theirs, seemed to me equally easy
to take and fruitless in operation, the others have to [[pay]] a thousand
vows to aesculapius, and as many crowns [[crown]] to their physicians, for the
voiding a little gravel, which i often do by the aid of [[nature]]: even the
decorum of my countenance is not disturbed in company; and i can hold my
water ten hours, and as long as any [[man]] in health.  the [[fear]] of this
disease,” says my [[mind]], “formerly affrighted thee, when it was unknown to
thee; the cries and despairing groans of those who make it worse by their
impatience, begot a [[horror]] in thee.  ‘tis an infirmity that punishes the
members by which thou hast most offended.  thou art [[arts]] a conscientious
fellow;”

               “quae venit indigne poena, dolenda venit:”

     [“we are entitled to [[complain]] of a [[punishment]] that we have not
     deserved.”--ovid, heroid., v. 8.]

“consider this chastisement: ‘tis very easy in comparison of others, and
inflicted with a paternal tenderness: do but observe how late it comes;
it only seizes on and incommodes that part of thy [[life]] which is, one way
and another, sterile and lost; having, as it were by composition, given
time for the licence and pleasures [[pleasure]] of thy [[youth]].  the [[fear]] and the
compassion that the [[people]] have of this disease serve thee for matter of
glory; a quality whereof if thou bast thy [[judgment]] purified, and that thy
reason has somewhat cured it, thy [[friends]] notwithstanding, discern some
tincture in thy [[complexion]].  ‘tis a [[pleasure]] to hear it said of oneself
what [[strength]] of [[mind]], what patience!  thou art [[arts]] seen to sweat with [[pain]],
to turn pale and red, to tremble, to vomit [[blood]], to suffer strange
contractions and convulsions, at times [[time]] to let [[great]] tears drop from thine
eyes, to urine thick, black, and dreadful water, or to have it suppressed
by some sharp and craggy stone, that cruelly pricks and tears the neck of
the bladder, whilst all the while thou entertainest the company with an
ordinary countenance; droning by fits with thy [[people]]; making one in a
continuous discourse, now and then making excuse for thy [[pain]], and
representing thy suffering less than it is.  dost thou call to [[mind]] the
men of [[past]] times [[time]], who so greedily sought diseases to keep their virtue
in breath and exercise?  put the case that [[nature]] sets thee on and impels
thee to this glorious school, into which thou wouldst never have entered
of thy own [[free]] will.  if thou tellest me that it is a dangerous and
mortal disease, what others are not so?  for ‘tis a physical [[cheat]] to
expect any that they say do not go direct to [[death]]: what matters if they
go thither by accident, or if they easily slide and slip into the path
that leads us to it?  but thou dost not [[die]] because thou art [[arts]] sick; thou
diest because thou art [[arts]] living: [[death]] kills thee without the [[help]] of
sickness: and sickness has deferred [[death]] in some, who have lived longer
by [[reason]] that they [[thought]] themselves always dying; to which may be
added, that as in wounds, so in diseases, some are medicinal and
wholesome.  the stone is often no less long-lived than you; we see men
with whom it has continued from their infancy even to their extreme old
age; and if they had not broken company, it would have been with them
longer still; you more often kill it than it kills you.  and though it
should [[present]] to you the image of approaching [[death]], were it not a good
office to a [[man]] of such an [[age]], to put him in [[mind]] of his end?  and,
which is worse, thou hast no longer anything that should make thee desire
to be cured.  whether or no, [[common]] necessity will soon call thee away.
do but consider how skilfully and gently she puts thee out of concern
with [[life]], and weans thee from the [[world]]; not forcing thee with a
tyrannical subjection, like so many other infirmities which thou seest
old [[men]] afflicted withal, that hold them in continual torment, and keep
them in perpetual and unintermitted weakness and pains [[pain]], but by warnings
and instructions at intervals, intermixing long pauses of repose, as it
were to give thee opportunity to meditate and ruminate upon thy lesson,
at thy own ease and leisure.  to give thee means to [[judge]] aright, and to
assume the resolution of a [[man]] of [[courage]], it presents [[present]] to thee the state
of thy entire condition, both in [[good]] and [[evil]]; and one while a very
cheerful and another an insupportable [[life]], in one and the same day.  if
thou embracest not [[death]], at least thou shakest hands with it once a
month; whence thou hast more cause to [[hope]] that it will one day surprise
thee without menace; and that being so often conducted to the water-side,
but still thinking thyself to be upon the accustomed terms, thou and thy
confidence will at one [[time]] or another be unexpectedly wafted over.  a
man cannot reasonably [[complain]] of diseases that fairly divide the time
with health.”

i am obliged to [[fortune]] for having so often assaulted me with the same
sort of [[weapons]]: she forms and fashions me by use, hardens and habituates
me, so that i can [[know]] within a little for how much i shall be quit.  for
want of [[natural]] memory, i make one of paper; and as any new symptom
happens in my disease, i set it down, whence it falls out that, having
now almost passed through all sorts of examples [[example]], if anything striking
threatens me, turning over these little loose notes, as the sybilline
leaves, i never fail of finding matter of consolation from some
favourable prognostic in my [[past]] [[experience]].  custom also makes me hope
better for the [[time]] to come; for, the conduct of this clearing out having
so long continued, ‘tis to be believed that [[nature]] will not alter her
course, and that no other worse accident will happen than what i already
feel.  and besides, the condition of this disease is not unsuitable to my
prompt and sudden [[complexion]]: when it assaults me gently, i am afraid,
for ‘tis then for a [[great]] while; but it has, naturally, brisk and
vigorous excesses; it claws me to [[purpose]] for a day or two.  my kidneys
held out an [[age]] without alteration; and i have almost now lived another,
since they changed their [[state]]; evils [[evil]] have their periods, as well as
benefits: peradventure, the infirmity draws towards an end.  [[age]] weakens
the heat of my stomach, and, its digestion being less [[perfect]], sends this
crude matter to my kidneys; why, at a [[certain]] [[revolution]], may not the
heat of my kidneys be also abated, so that they can no more petrify my
phlegm, and [[nature]] find out some other way of purgation.  years have
evidently helped me to drain [[certain]] rheums; and why not these excrements
which furnish matter for gravel?  but is there anything delightful in
comparison of this sudden [[change]], when from an excessive [[pain]], i come, by
the voiding of a stone, to recover, as by a flash of lightning, the
beautiful [[light]] of health, so [[free]] and full, as it happens in our sudden
and sharpest colics?  is there anything in the [[pain]] [[suffered]], that one
can counterpoise to the [[pleasure]] of so sudden an amendment?  oh, how much
does health seem the more pleasant to me, after a sickness so near and so
contiguous, that i can distinguish them in the presence of one another,
in their [[greatest]] show; when they appear in emulation, as if to make head
against and dispute it with one another!  as the stoics say that vices
are profitably introduced to give value to and to set off [[virtue]], we can,
with [[better]] [[reason]] and less temerity of conjecture, say that [[nature]] has
given us [[pain]] for the [[honour]] and service of [[pleasure]] and indolence.  when
socrates, after his fetters were knocked off, [[felt]] the [[pleasure]] of that
itching which the weight of them had caused in his legs, he rejoiced to
consider the strict [[alliance]] betwixt [[pain]] and [[pleasure]]; how they are
linked together by a necessary connection, so that by turns they follow
and mutually beget one another; and cried out to [[good]] aesop, that he
ought out of this consideration to have taken matter for a fine fable.

the worst that i see in other diseases is, that they are not so grievous
in their effect as they are in their issue: a [[man]] is a whole year in
recovering, and all the while full of weakness and [[fear]].  there is so
much hazard, and so many steps to arrive at safety, that there is no end
on’t before they have unmuffled you of a kerchief, and then of a cap,
before they allow you to walk abroad and take the air, to drink wine, to
lie with your [[wife]], to [[eat]] melons, ‘tis odds you relapse into some new
distemper.  the stone has this [[privilege]], that it carries itself clean
off: whereas the other maladies always leave behind them some impression
and alteration that render the [[body]] [[subject]] to a new disease, and lend a
hand to one another.  those are excusable that content themselves with
possessing us, without extending farther and introducing their followers;
but courteous and [[kind]] are those whose passage brings us any profitable
issue.  since i have been troubled with the stone, i find myself freed
from all other accidents, much more, methinks, than i was before, and
have never had any fever since; i argue that the extreme and frequent
vomitings that i am [[subject]] to purge me: and, on the other hand, my
distastes for this and that, and the [[strange]] fasts i am forced to keep,
digest my peccant humours [[humour]], and [[nature]], with those stones, voids whatever
there is in me superfluous and hurtful.  let them never tell me that it
is a medicine too dear bought: for what avail so many stinking draughts,
so many caustics, incisions, sweats, setons, diets, and so many other
methods of cure, which often, by [[reason]] we are not able to undergo their
violence and importunity, bring us to our graves?  so that when i have
the stone, i look upon it as physic; when [[free]] from it, as an absolute
deliverance.

and here is another particular benefit of my disease; which is, that it
almost plays its game by itself, and lets ‘me play mine, if i have only
courage to do it; for, in its [[greatest]] fury, i have endured it ten hours
together on horseback.  do but endure only; you need no other regimen
play, run, dine, do this and t’other, if you can; your debauch will do
you more [[good]] than harm; say as much to one that has the pox, the gout,
or hernia!  the other diseases have more universal obligations; rack our
actions after another [[kind]] of manner, disturb our whole order, and to
their consideration engage the whole [[state]] of [[life]]: this only pinches the
skin; it leaves the understanding and the will wholly at our own
disposal, and the tongue, the hands, and the feet; it rather awakens than
stupefies you.  the [[soul]] is struck with the ardour of a fever,
overwhelmed with an epilepsy, and displaced by a sharp megrim, and, in
short, astounded by all the diseases that hurt the whole mass and the
most [[noble]] parts; this never meddles with the [[soul]]; if anything goes
amiss with her, ‘tis her own [[fault]]; she betrays, dismounts, and abandons
herself.  there are none but fools [[fool]] who suffer themselves to be persuaded
that this hard and massive [[body]] which is baked in our kidneys is to be
dissolved by drinks; wherefore, when it is once stirred, there is nothing
to be done but to give it passage; and, for that matter, it will itself
make one.

i moreover observe this particular convenience in it, that it is a
disease wherein we have little to guess at: we are dispensed from the
trouble into which other diseases throw us by the uncertainty of their
causes, conditions, and [[progress]]; a trouble that is infinitely painful:
we have no need of consultations and doctoral interpretations; the senses
well enough inform us both what it is and where it is.

by suchlike arguments, [[weak]] and [[strong]], as cicero with the disease of his
old [[age]], i try to rock asleep and amuse my [[imagination]], and to dress its
wounds.  if i find them worse tomorrow, i will provide new stratagems.
that this is true: i am come to that pass of late, that the least motion
forces pure [[blood]] out of my kidneys: what of that?  i move about,
nevertheless, as before, and ride after my hounds with a juvenile and
insolent ardour; and hold that i have very [[good]] satisfaction for an
accident of that importance, when it costs me no more but a dull
heaviness and uneasiness in that part; ‘tis some [[great]] stone that wastes
and consumes the substance of my kidneys and my [[life]], which i by little
and little evacuate, not without some [[natural]] [[pleasure]], as an excrement
henceforward superfluous and troublesome.  now if i [[feel]] anything
stirring, do not fancy that i trouble myself to consult my pulse or my
urine, thereby to put myself upon some annoying prevention; i shall soon
enough [[feel]] the [[pain]], without making it more and longer by the disease of
fear.  he who fears [[fear]] he shall suffer, already suffers what he fears [[fear]].  to
which may be added that the doubts [[doubt]] and ignorance of those who take upon
them to expound the designs of [[nature]] and her internal progressions, and
the many false prognostics of their art [[arts]], ought to give us to understand
that her ways are inscrutable and utterly unknown; there is great
uncertainty, variety, and obscurity in what she either promises or
threatens.  old [[age]] excepted, which is an indubitable sign of the
approach of [[death]], in all other accidents i see few signs of the future,
whereon we may ground our divination.  i only [[judge]] of myself by actual
sensation, not by reasoning: to what end, since i am resolved to bring
nothing to it but expectation and patience?  will you [[know]] how much i get
by this? observe those who do otherwise, and who rely upon so many
diverse persuasions and counsels; how often the [[imagination]] presses upon
them without any bodily [[pain]].  i have many times [[time]] amused myself, being
well and in safety, and quite [[free]] from these dangerous attacks in
communicating them to the physicians as then beginning to discover
themselves in me; i underwent the decree of their dreadful conclusions,
being all the while quite at my ease, and so much the more obliged to the
favour of [[god]] and [[better]] satisfied of the vanity of this art [[arts]].

there is nothing that ought so much to be recommended to [[youth]] as
activity and vigilance our [[life]] is nothing but movement.  i bestir myself
with [[great]] difficulty, and am slow in everything, whether in rising,
going to bed, or eating: seven of the clock in the morning is early for
me, and where i [[rule]], i never dine before eleven, nor sup till after six.
i formerly attributed the cause of the fevers and other diseases i fell
into to the heaviness that long sleeping had brought upon me, and have
ever repented going to sleep again in the morning.  [[plato]] is more angry
at excess of sleeping than at excess of drinking.  i [[love]] to [[lie]] hard and
alone, even without my [[wife]], as kings [[king]] do; pretty well covered with
clothes.  they never warm my bed, but since i have grown old they give me
at need cloths to lay to my feet and stomach.  they found [[fault]] with the
great scipio that he was a [[great]] sleeper; not, in my [[opinion]], for any
other [[reason]] than that [[men]] were displeased that he alone should have
nothing in him to be found [[fault]] with.  if i am anything fastidious in my
way of living ‘tis rather in my lying than anything else; but generally
i give way and accommodate myself as well as any one to necessity.
sleeping has taken up a [[great]] part of my [[life]], and i yet continue, at the
age i now am, to sleep eight or nine hours at one breath.  i wean myself
with utility from this proneness to sloth, and am evidently the better
for so doing.  i find the [[change]] a little hard indeed, but in three days
‘tis over; and i see but few who [[live]] with less sleep, when need
requires, and who more constantly exercise themselves, or to whom long
journeys are less troublesome.  my [[body]] is capable of a firm, but not of
a [[violent]] or sudden agitation.  i escape of late from [[violent]] exercises,
and such as make me sweat: my limbs grow weary before they are warm.
i can stand a whole day together, and am never weary of walking; but from
my [[youth]] i have ever preferred to ride upon paved roads; on foot, i get
up to the haunches in dirt, and little fellows as i am are [[subject]] in the
streets to be elbowed and jostled for want of presence; i have ever loved
to repose myself, whether sitting or lying, with my heels as high or
higher than my seat.

there is no profession as pleasant as the [[military]], a profession both
noble in its execution (for valour is the stoutest, proudest, and most
generous of all virtues), and [[noble]] in its cause: there is no utility
either more universal or more just than the protection of the [[peace]] and
greatness of one’s [[country]].  the company of so many [[noble]], [[young]], and
active [[men]] delights you; the ordinary sight of so many tragic spectacles;
the [[freedom]] of the conversation, without art [[arts]]; a masculine and
unceremonious way of living, please you; the variety of a thousand
several actions; the encouraging harmony of martial [[music]] that ravishes
and inflames both your ears and souls [[soul]]; the [[honour]] of this occupation,
nay, even its hardships and difficulties, which [[plato]] holds so [[light]] that
in his [[republic]] he makes [[women]] and [[children]] share in them, are delightful
to you.  you put yourself voluntarily upon particular exploits and
hazards, according as you [[judge]] of their lustre and importance; and, a
volunteer, find even [[life]] itself excusably employed:

               “pulchrumque mori succurrit in armis.”

          [“‘tis fine to [[die]] [[sword]] in hand.” (“and he remembers that it
          is honourable to [[die]] in arms.”)--aeneid, ii. 317.]


to [[fear]] [[common]] dangers that concern so [[great]] a multitude of [[men]]; not to
dare to do what so many sorts of souls [[soul]], what a whole [[people]] dare, is for
a [[heart]] that is [[poor]] and mean beyond all measure: company encourages even
children.  if others excel you in [[knowledge]], in gracefulness, in
strength, or [[fortune]], you have alternative resources at your disposal;
but to give place to them in stability of [[mind]], you can blame no one for
that but yourself. [[death]] is more abject, more languishing and
troublesome, in bed than in a [[fight]]: fevers and catarrhs as painful and
mortal as a musket-shot.  whoever has fortified himself valiantly to bear
the accidents of [[common]] [[life]] need not raise his [[courage]] to be a soldier:

                    “vivere, mi lucili, militare est.”

          [“to [[live]], my lucilius, is (to make war) to be a soldier.”
           --seneca, ep., 96.]

i do not [[remember]] that i ever had the itch, and yet scratching is one of
nature’s sweetest gratifications, and so much at hand; but repentance
follows too near.  i use it most in my ears, which are at intervals apt
to itch.

i came into the [[world]] with all my senses entire, even to [[perfection]].  my
stomach is commodiously [[good]], as also is my head and my breath; and, for
the most part, uphold themselves so in the height of fevers.  i have
passed the [[age]] to which some nations, not without [[reason]], have prescribed
so just a term of [[life]] that they would not suffer [[men]] to exceed it; and
yet i have some intermissions, though short and inconstant, so clean and
sound as to be little inferior to the health and pleasantness of my
youth.  i do not speak of vigour and sprightliness; ‘tis not [[reason]] they
should [[follow]] me beyond their limits:

               “non hoc amplius est liminis, aut aquae
               coelestis, patiens latus.”

     [“i am no longer able to stand waiting at a door in the rain.”
      --horace, od., iii. 10, 9.]

my face and [[eyes]] presently discover my condition; all my alterations
begin there, and appear somewhat worse than they really are; my friends
often [[pity]] me before i [[feel]] the cause in myself.  my looking-glass does
not frighten me; for even in my [[youth]] it has befallen me more than once
to have a scurvy [[complexion]] and of ill augury, without any great
consequence, so that the physicians, not finding any cause within
answerable to that outward alteration, attributed it to the [[mind]] and to
some secret passion that tormented me within; but they were deceived.
if my [[body]] would govern itself as well, according to my [[rule]], as my mind
does, we should move a little more at our ease.  my [[mind]] was then not
only [[free]] from trouble, but, moreover, full of joy and satisfaction,
as it commonly is, half by its [[complexion]], half by its design:

               “nec vitiant artus aegrae contagia mentis.”

          [“nor do the troubles of the [[body]] ever affect my [[mind]].”
           --ovid, trist., iii. 8, 25.]

i am of the [[opinion]] that this temperature of my [[soul]] has often raised my
body from its lapses; this is often depressed; if the other be not brisk
and [[gay]], ‘tis at least tranquil and at rest.  i had a quartan ague four
or five months, that made me look miserably ill; my [[mind]] was always, if
not calm, yet pleasant.  if the [[pain]] be without me, the weakness and
languor do not much afflict me; i see various corporal faintings, that
beget a [[horror]] in me but to name, which yet i should less [[fear]] than a
thousand [[passions]] and agitations of the [[mind]] that i see about me.  i make
up my [[mind]] no more to run; ‘tis enough that i can crawl along; nor do i
more [[complain]] of the [[natural]] decadence that i [[feel]] in myself:

               “quis tumidum guttur miratur in alpibus?”

          [“who is surprised to see a swollen goitre in the alps?”
           --juvenal, xiii. 162.]

than i regret that my duration shall not be as long and entire as that of
an oak.

i have no [[reason]] to [[complain]] of my [[imagination]]; i have had few thoughts
in my [[life]] that have so much as broken my sleep, except those of [[desire]],
which have awakened without afflicting me.  i [[dream]] but seldom, and then
of chimaeras and fantastic things, commonly produced from pleasant
thoughts, and rather ridiculous than [[sad]]; and i [[believe]] it to be true
that dreams [[dream]] are faithful interpreters of our inclinations; but there is
art required to sort and [[understand]] them

    “res, quae in vita usurpant homines, cogitant, curant, vident,
     quaeque agunt vigilantes, agitantque, ea si cui in somno accidunt,
     minus mirandum est.”

     [“‘tis less wonder, what [[men]] practise, [[think]], [[care]] for, see, and do
     when waking, (should also run in their heads and disturb them when
     they are asleep) and which affect their feelings, if they happen to
     any in sleep.”--attius, cited in cicero, de divin., i. 22.]

plato, moreover, says, that ‘tis the office of prudence to draw
instructions of divination of future things from dreams [[dream]]: i don’t know
about this, but there are wonderful instances of it that [[socrates]],
xenophon, and [[aristotle]], [[men]] of irreproachable [[authority]], relate.
historians say that the atlantes never [[dream]]; who also never [[eat]] any
animal food, which i add, forasmuch as it is, peradventure, the reason
why they never [[dream]], for pythagoras ordered a [[certain]] preparation of
diet to beget appropriate dreams [[dream]].  mine are very gentle, without any
agitation of [[body]] or expression of voice.  i have seen several of my time
wonderfully disturbed by them.  theon the philosopher walked in his
sleep, and so did pericles servant, and that upon the tiles and top of
the house.

i hardly ever choose my dish at table, but take the next at hand, and
unwillingly [[change]] it for another.  a confusion of meats and a clatter of
dishes displease me as much as any other confusion: i am easily satisfied
with few dishes: and am an [[enemy]] to the [[opinion]] of favorinus, that in a
feast they should snatch from you the meat you like, and set a plate of
another sort before you; and that ‘tis a pitiful supper, if you do not
sate your guests with the rumps of various fowls, the beccafico only
deserving to be all eaten.  i usually [[eat]] salt meats, yet i prefer bread
that has no salt in it; and my baker never sends up other to my table,
contrary to the custom of the [[country]].  in my infancy, what they had most
to [[correct]] in me was the refusal of things that [[children]] commonly best
love, as sugar, sweetmeats, and march-panes.  my tutor contended with
this aversion to delicate things, as a [[kind]] of over-nicety; and indeed
‘tis nothing else but a difficulty of taste, in anything it applies
itself to.  whoever cures a child of an obstinate liking for brown bread,
bacon, or garlic, cures him also of pampering his palate.  there are some
who affect temperance and plainness by wishing for beef and ham amongst
the partridges; ‘tis all very fine; this is the delicacy of the delicate;
‘tis the taste of an effeminate [[fortune]] that disrelishes ordinary and
accustomed things.

               “per qux luxuria divitiarum taedio ludit.”

     [“by which the luxury of [[wealth]] causes tedium.”--seneca, ep., 18.]

not to make [[good]] cheer with what another is enjoying, and to be curious
in what a [[man]] eats, is the essence of this [[vice]]:

               “si modica coenare times [[time]] olus omne patella.”

     [“if you can’t be content with herbs in a small dish for supper.”
      --horace, ep., i. 5, 2.]

there is indeed this difference, that ‘tis [[better]] to oblige one’s
appetite to things that are most easy to be had; but ‘tis always [[vice]] to
oblige one’s [[self]].  i formerly said a kinsman of mine was overnice, who,
by being in our galleys, had unlearned the use of beds and to undress
when he went to sleep.

if i had any sons [[son]], i should willingly [[wish]] them my [[fortune]].  the good
father that [[god]] gave me (who has nothing of me but the acknowledgment of
his goodness, but truly ‘tis a very hearty one) sent me from my cradle to
be brought up in a [[poor]] village of his, and there continued me all the
while i was at nurse, and still longer, bringing me up to the meanest and
most [[common]] way of living:

          “magna pars libertatis est bene moratus venter.”

          [“a well-governed stomach is a [[great]] part of [[liberty]].”
           --seneca,ep., 123.]

never take upon yourselves, and much less give up to your wives [[wife]], the care
of their nurture; leave the formation to [[fortune]], under popular and
natural laws [[law]]; leave it to custom to train them up to frugality and
hardship, that they may rather descend from rigour than mount up to it.
this [[humour]] of his yet aimed at another end, to make me familiar with the
people and the condition of [[men]] who most need our assistance; considering
that i should rather regard them who extend their arms to me, than those
who turn their backs upon me; and for this [[reason]] it was that he provided
to hold me at the font persons [[person]] of the meanest [[fortune]], to oblige and
attach me to them.

nor has his design succeeded altogether ill; for, whether upon the
account of the more [[honour]] in such a condescension, or out of a natural
compassion that has a very [[great]] [[power]] over me, i have an inclination
towards the meaner sort of [[people]].  the faction which i should condemn in
our wars [[war]], i should more sharply condemn, flourishing and successful; it
will somewhat reconcile me to it, when i shall see it miserable and
overwhelmed.  how willingly do i [[admire]] the fine [[humour]] of cheilonis,
daughter and [[wife]] to kings [[king]] of sparta.  whilst her husband cleombrotus, in
the commotion of her [[city]], had the advantage over leonidas her [[father]],
she, like a [[good]] [[daughter]], stuck close to her [[father]] in all his misery
and [[exile]], in opposition to the conqueror.  but so soon as the [[chance]] of
war turned, she changed her will with the [[change]] of [[fortune]], and bravely
turned to her husband’s side, whom she accompanied throughout, where his
ruin carried him: admitting, as it appears to me, no other [[choice]] than to
cleave to the side that stood most in need of her, and where she could
best manifest her compassion.  i am naturally more apt to [[follow]] the
example of flaminius, who rather gave his assistance to those who had
most need of him than to those who had [[power]] to do him [[good]], than i do to
that of pyrrhus, who was of an [[humour]] to truckle under the [[great]] and to
domineer over the [[poor]].

long sittings at table both trouble me and do me harm; for, be it that i
was so accustomed when a child, i [[eat]] all the while i sit.  therefore it
is that at my own house, though the meals there are of the shortest, i
usually sit down a little while after the rest, after the manner of
augustus, but i do not imitate him in rising also before the rest; on the
contrary, i [[love]] to sit still a long [[time]] after, and to hear them talk,
provided i am none of the talkers: for i tire and hurt myself with
speaking upon a full stomach, as much as i find it very wholesome and
pleasant to argue and to strain my voice before dinner.

the ancient greeks [[greek]] and romans had more [[reason]] than we in setting apart
for eating, which is a principal action of [[life]], if they were not
prevented by other extraordinary [[business]], many hours and the greatest
part of the night; eating and drinking more deliberately than we do, who
perform all our actions post-haste; and in extending this natural
pleasure to more leisure and [[better]] use, intermixing with profitable
conversation.

they whose concern it is to have a [[care]] of me, may very easily hinder me
from eating anything they [[think]] will do me harm; for in such matters i
never covet nor miss anything i do not see; but withal, if it once comes
in my sight, ‘tis in [[vain]] to persuade me to forbear; so that when i
design to fast i must be kept apart from the suppers, and must have only
so much given me as is required for a prescribed collation; for if to
table, i forget my resolution.  when i order my cook to alter the manner
of dressing any dish, all my [[family]] [[know]] what it means, that my stomach
is out of order, and that i shall not touch it.

i [[love]] to have all meats, that will endure it, very little boiled or
roasted, and prefer them very high, and even, as to several, quite gone.
nothing but hardness generally offends me (of any other quality i am as
patient and indifferent as any [[man]] i have known); so that, contrary to
the [[common]] [[humour]], even in fish it often happens that i find them both
too fresh and too firm; not for want of teeth, which i ever had [[good]],
even to excellence, and which [[age]] does not now begin to threaten; i have
always been used every morning to rub them with a napkin, and before and
after dinner.  [[god]] is favourable to those whom he makes to [[die]] by
degrees; ‘tis the only benefit of old [[age]]; the [[last]] [[death]] will be so much
the less painful; it will kill but a half or a quarter of a [[man]].  there
is one tooth lately fallen out without drawing and without [[pain]]; it was
the [[natural]] term of its duration; in that part of my being and several
others, are already [[dead]], others half [[dead]], of those that were most
active and in the first rank during my vigorous years; ‘tis so i melt and
steal away from myself.  what a folly it would be in my understanding to
apprehend the height of this fall, already so much advanced, as if it
were from the very top!  i [[hope]] i shall not.  i, in [[truth]], receive a
principal consolation in meditating my [[death]], that it will be just and
natural, and that henceforward i cannot herein either require or hope
from [[destiny]] any other but unlawful favour.  [[men]] make themselves believe
that we formerly had longer lives [[life]] as well as greater stature.  but they
deceive themselves; and solon, who was of those elder times [[time]], limits the
duration of [[life]] to threescore and ten years. i, who have so much and so
universally adored that “the mean is [[best]],” of the passed [[time]], and who
have concluded the most moderate measures to be the most [[perfect]], shall
i pretend to an immeasurable and prodigious old [[age]]?  whatever happens
contrary to the course of [[nature]] may be troublesome; but what comes
according to her should always be pleasant:

     “omnia, quae secundum naturam fiunt, sunt habenda in bonis.”

     [“all things that are done according to nature
     are to be accounted [[good]].”--cicero, de senect., c. 19.]

and so, says [[plato]], the [[death]] which is occasioned by wounds and diseases
is [[violent]]; but that which comes upon us, old [[age]] conducting us to it, is
of all others the most easy, and in some sort delicious:

          “vitam adolescentibus vis aufert, senibus maturitas.”

     [“young [[men]] are taken away by [[violence]], old [[men]] by maturity.”
      --cicero, ubi sup.]

death mixes and confounds itself throughout with [[life]]; decay anticipates
its hour, and shoulders itself even into the course of our advance.
i have portraits of myself taken at five-and-twenty and five-and-thirty
years of [[age]].  i compare them with that lately drawn: how many times [[time]] is
it no longer me; how much more is my [[present]] image unlike the former,
than unlike my dying one?  it is too much to [[abuse]] [[nature]], to make her
trot so far that she must be forced to leave us, and abandon our conduct,
our [[eyes]], teeth, legs, and all the rest to the [[mercy]] of a [[foreign]] and
haggard countenance, and to resign us into the hands of art [[arts]], being weary
of following us herself.

i am not excessively fond either of salads or fruits, except melons.  my
father hated all sorts of sauces; i [[love]] them all.  eating too much hurts
me; but, as to the quality of what i [[eat]], i do not yet certainly know
that any sort of meat disagrees with me; neither have i observed that
either full moon or decrease, autumn or spring, have any influence upon
me.  we have in us motions that are inconstant and unknown; for [[example]],
i found radishes first grateful to my stomach, since that nauseous, and
now again grateful.  in several other things, i find my stomach and
appetite vary after the same manner; i have changed again and again from
white wine to claret, from claret to [[white]] wine.

i am a [[great]] lover of fish, and consequently make my fasts feasts and
feasts fasts; and i [[believe]] what some [[people]] say, that it is more easy of
digestion than flesh.  as i make a [[conscience]] of eating flesh upon
fish-days, so does my taste make a [[conscience]] of mixing fish and flesh;
the difference betwixt them seems to me too remote.

from my [[youth]], i have sometimes kept out of the way at meals; either to
sharpen my appetite against the next morning (for, as epicurus fasted and
made lean meals to accustom his [[pleasure]] to make shift without abundance,
i, on the contrary, do it to prepare my [[pleasure]] to make [[better]] and more
cheerful use of abundance); or else i fasted to preserve my vigour for
the service of some action of [[body]] or [[mind]]: for both the one and the
other of these is cruelly dulled in me by repletion; and, above all
things, i hate that foolish coupling of so healthful and sprightly a
goddess with that little belching [[god]], bloated with the fumes of his
liquor--[ montaigne did not approve of coupling bacchus with [[venus]].]--
or to cure my sick stomach, or for want of fit company; for i say, as the
same epicurus did, that one is not so much to regard what he eats, as
with whom; and i commend chilo, that he would not engage himself to be at
periander’s feast till he was first informed who were to be the other
guests; no dish is so acceptable to me, nor no sauce so appetising, as
that which is extracted from [[society]].  i [[think]] it more wholesome to eat
more leisurely and less, and to [[eat]] oftener; but i would have appetite
and [[hunger]] attended to; i should take no [[pleasure]] to be fed with three or
four pitiful and stinted repasts a day, after a medicinal manner: who
will assure me that, if i have a [[good]] appetite in the morning, i shall
have the same at supper?  but we old fellows especially, let us take the
first opportune [[time]] of eating, and leave to almanac-makers hopes [[hope]] and
prognostics.  the utmost fruit of my health is [[pleasure]]; let us take hold
of the [[present]] and known.  i avoid the invariable in these laws [[law]] of
fasting; he who would have one form serve him, let him avoid the
continuing it; we harden ourselves in it; our [[strength]] is there stupefied
and laid asleep; six months after, you shall find your stomach so inured
to it, that all you have got is the loss of your [[liberty]] of doing
otherwise but to your prejudice.

i never keep my legs and thighs warmer in winter than in summer; one
simple pair of silk stockings is all.  i have [[suffered]] myself, for the
relief of my colds, to keep my head warmer, and my belly upon the account
of my colic: my diseases in a few days habituate themselves thereto, and
disdained my ordinary provisions: we soon get from a coif to a kerchief
over it, from a simple cap to a quilted hat; the trimmings of the doublet
must not merely serve for ornament: there must be added a hare’s skin or
a vulture’s skin, and a cap under the hat: [[follow]] this gradation, and you
will go a very fine way to [[work]].  i will do nothing of the sort, and
would willingly leave off what i have begun.  if you fall into any new
inconvenience, all this is [[labour]] lost; you are accustomed to it; seek
out some other.  thus do they [[destroy]] themselves who submit to be
pestered with these enforced and [[superstitious]] rules [[rule]]; they must add
something more, and something more after that; there is no end on’t.

for what concerns our affairs and pleasures [[pleasure]], it is much more commodious,
as the ancients did, to lose one’s dinner, and defer making [[good]] cheer
till the hour of retirement and repose, without breaking up a day; and so
was i formerly used to do.  as to health, i since by [[experience]] find, on
the contrary, that it is [[better]] to dine, and that the digestion is better
while awake.  i am not very used to be thirsty, either well or sick; my
mouth is, indeed, apt to be dry, but without thirst; and commonly i never
drink but with thirst that is created by eating, and far on in the meal;
i drink pretty well for a [[man]] of my pitch: in summer, and at a relishing
meal, i do not only exceed the limits of augustus, who drank but thrice
precisely; but not to offend democritus [[rule]], who forbade that [[men]] should
stop at four times [[time]] as an unlucky number, i proceed at need to the fifth
glass, about three half-pints; for the little glasses are my favourites,
and i like to drink them off, which other [[people]] avoid as an unbecoming
thing.  i mix my wine sometimes with half, sometimes with the third part
water; and when i am at [[home]], by an ancient custom that my father’s
physician prescribed both to him and himself, they mix that which is
designed for me in the buttery, two or three hours before ‘tis brought
in.  ‘tis said that cranabs, [[king]] of attica, was the inventor of this
custom of diluting wine; whether useful or no, i have heard disputed.
i [[think]] it more decent and wholesome for [[children]] to drink no wine till
after sixteen or eighteen years of [[age]].  the most usual and [[common]] method
of living is the most becoming; all particularity, in my [[opinion]], is to
be avoided; and i should as much hate a [[german]] who mixed water with his
wine, as i should a frenchman who drank it pure.  [[public]] usage gives the
law in these things.

i [[fear]] a mist, and fly from smoke as from the plague: the first repairs i
fell upon in my own house were the chimneys and houses of office, the
common and insupportable defects of all old buildings; and amongst the
difficulties of [[war]] i reckon the choking dust they made us ride in a
whole day together.  i have a [[free]] and easy respiration, and my colds for
the most part go off without offence to the lungs and without a cough.

the heat of summer is more an [[enemy]] to me than the cold of winter; for,
besides the incommodity of heat, less remediable than cold, and besides
the [[force]] of the sunbeams that strike upon the head, all glittering light
offends my [[eyes]], so that i could not now sit at dinner over against a
flaming [[fire]].

to dull the whiteness of paper, in those times [[time]] when i was more wont to
read, i laid a piece of glass upon my [[book]], and found my [[eyes]] much
relieved by it.  i am to this hour--to the [[age]] of fifty-four--ignorant of
the use of spectacles; and i can see as far as ever i did, or any other.
‘tis true that in the evening i begin to find a little disturbance and
weakness in my sight if i [[read]], an exercise i have always found
troublesome, especially by night.  here is one step back, and a very
manifest one; i shall retire another: from the second to the third, and
so to the fourth, so gently, that i shall be stark blind before i shall
be sensible of the [[age]] and decay of my sight: so artificially do the
fatal sisters untwist our lives [[life]].  and so i [[doubt]] whether my hearing
begins to grow thick; and you will see i shall have half lost it, when i
shall still lay the [[fault]] on the voices of those who speak to me.  a man
must screw up his [[soul]] to a high pitch to make it sensible how it ebbs
away.

my walking is quick and firm; and i [[know]] not which of the two, my [[mind]] or
my [[body]], i have most to do to keep in the same [[state]].  that preacher is
very much my friend who can fix my attention a whole sermon through: in
places of [[ceremony]], where every one’s countenance is so starched, where i
have seen the ladies [[lady]] keep even their [[eyes]] so fixed, i could never order
it so, that some part or other of me did not lash out; so that though i
was seated, i was never settled; and as to gesticulation, i am never
without a switch in my hand, walking or riding.  as the philosopher
chrysippus’ maid said of her master, that he was only drunk in his legs,
for it was his custom to be always kicking them about in what place
soever he sat; and she said it when, the wine having made all his
companions drunk, he found no alteration in himself at all; it may have
been said of me from my infancy, that i had either folly or quicksilver
in my feet, so much stirring and unsettledness there is in them, wherever
they are placed.

‘tis indecent, besides the hurt it does to one’s health, and even to the
pleasure of eating, to [[eat]] greedily as i do; i often bite my tongue, and
sometimes my fingers, in my haste.  diogenes, meeting a boy eating after
that manner, gave his tutor a box on the ear!  there were [[men]] at rome
that taught [[people]] to chew, as well as to walk, with a [[good]] grace.  i
lose thereby the leisure of speaking, which gives [[great]] relish to the
table, provided the discourse be suitable, that is, pleasant and short.

there is [[jealousy]] and envy amongst our pleasures [[pleasure]]; they cross and hinder
one another.  alcibiades, a [[man]] who well understood how to make good
cheer, [[banished]] even [[music]] from the table, that it might not disturb the
entertainment of discourse, for the [[reason]], as [[plato]] tells us, “that it
is the custom of ordinary [[people]] to call fiddlers and singing [[men]] to
feasts, for want of [[good]] discourse and pleasant talk, with which [[men]] of
understanding [[know]] how to entertain one another.”  varro requires all
this in entertainments: “persons of graceful presence and agreeable
conversation, who are neither silent nor garrulous; neatness and
delicacy, both of meat and place; and [[fair]] weather.”  the art [[arts]] of dining
well is no slight art [[arts]], the [[pleasure]] not a slight [[pleasure]]; neither the
greatest captains nor the [[greatest]] [[philosophers]] have disdained the use or
science of eating well.  my [[imagination]] has delivered three repasts to
the custody of my memory, which [[fortune]] rendered sovereignly sweet to me,
upon several occasions [[occasion]] in my more flourishing [[age]]; my [[present]] state
excludes me; for every one, according to the [[good]] temper of [[body]] and mind
wherein he then finds himself, furnishes for his own share a particular
grace and savour.  i, who but crawl upon the [[earth]], hate this inhuman
wisdom, that will have us despise and hate all [[culture]] of the [[body]]; i
look upon it as an [[equal]] [[injustice]] to loath [[natural]] pleasures [[pleasure]] as to be
too much in [[love]] with them.  xerxes was a blockhead, who, environed with
all [[human]] delights, proposed a [[reward]] to him who could find out others;
but he is not much less so who cuts off any of those pleasures [[pleasure]] that
nature has provided for him.  a [[man]] should neither pursue nor avoid them,
but receive them.  i receive them, i confess, a little too warmly and
kindly, and easily suffer myself to [[follow]] my [[natural]] propensions.  we
have no need to exaggerate their inanity; they themselves will make us
sufficiently sensible of it, thanks to our sick wet-blanket [[mind]], that
puts us out of taste with them as with itself; it treats both itself and
all it receives, one while [[better]], and another worse, according to its
insatiable, vagabond, and versatile essence:

         “sincerum est nisi vas, quodcunque infundis, acescit.”

          [“unless the vessel be clean, it will sour whatever
          you put into it.”--horace, ep., i. 2, 54.]

i, who boast that i so curiously and particularly embrace the
conveniences of [[life]], find them, when i most nearly consider them, very
little more than wind.  but what?  we are all wind throughout; and,
moreover, the wind itself, more discreet than we, loves [[love]] to bluster and
shift from corner to corner, and contents itself with its proper offices
without desiring stability and solidity-qualities not its own.

the pure pleasures [[pleasure]], as well as the pure displeasures, of the [[imagination]],
say some, are the [[greatest]], as was expressed by the balance of
critolaiis.  ‘tis no wonder; it makes them to its own liking, and cuts
them out of the whole cloth; of this i every day see notable examples [[example]],
and, peradventure, to be [[desired]].  but i, who am of a mixed and heavy
condition, cannot snap so soon at this one simple object, but that i
negligently suffer myself to be carried away with the [[present]] pleasures
of the, general [[human]] [[law]], intellectually sensible, and sensibly
intellectual.  the cyrenaic [[philosophers]] will have it that as corporal
pains, so corporal pleasures [[pleasure]] are more powerful, both as double and as
more just.  there are some, as [[aristotle]] says, who out of a savage kind
of stupidity dislike them; and i [[know]] others who out of [[ambition]] do the
same.  why do they not, moreover, forswear breathing?  why do they not
live of their own?  why not refuse [[light]], because it is gratuitous, and
costs them neither invention nor exertion?  let [[mars]], pallas, or mercury
afford them their [[light]] by which to see, instead of [[venus]], ceres, and
bacchus.  these boastful humours [[humour]] may counterfeit some content, for what
will not fancy do?  but as to [[wisdom]], there is no touch of it.  will they
not seek the quadrature of the circle, even when on their wives [[wife]]?  i hate
that we should be enjoined to have our minds [[mind]] in the clouds, when our
bodies are at table; i would not have the [[mind]] nailed there, nor wallow
there; i would have it take place there and sit, but not [[lie]] down.
aristippus maintained nothing but the [[body]], as if we had no [[soul]]; zeno
comprehended only the [[soul]], as if we had no [[body]]: both of them faultily.
pythagoras, they say, followed a [[philosophy]] that was all contemplation,
socrates one that was all conduct and action; [[plato]] found a mean betwixt
the two; but they only say this for the sake of talking.  the true
temperament is found in [[socrates]]; and, [[plato]] is much more socratic than
pythagoric, and it becomes him [[better]].  when i dance, i dance; when i
sleep, i sleep.  nay, when i walk alone in a beautiful orchard, if my
thoughts are some part of the [[time]] taken up with external occurrences,
i some part of the [[time]] call them back again to my walk, to the orchard,
to the sweetness of that solitude, and to myself.

nature has mother-like observed this, that the actions she has enjoined
us for our necessity should be also pleasurable to us; and she invites us
to them, not only by [[reason]], but also by appetite, and ‘tis [[injustice]] to
infringe her laws [[law]].  when i see alike caesar and alexander, in the midst
of his [[greatest]] [[business]], so fully enjoy [[human]] and corporal pleasures [[pleasure]], i
do not say that he relaxed his [[mind]]: i say that he strengthened it, by
vigour of [[courage]] subjecting those [[violent]] employments and laborious
thoughts to the ordinary usage of [[life]]: [[wise]], had he believed the last
was his ordinary, the first his extraordinary, vocation.  we are great
fools.  “he has passed his [[life]] in idleness,” say we: “i have done
nothing to-day.”  what? have you not lived?  that is not only the
fundamental, but the most illustrious, of your occupations.  “had i been
put to the management of [[great]] affairs, i should have made it seen what i
could do.”  “have you known how to meditate and manage your [[life]]?  you
have performed the [[greatest]] [[work]] of all.”  in order to shew and develop
herself, [[nature]] needs only [[fortune]]; she equally manifests herself in all
stages, and behind a curtain as well as without one.  have you known how
to regulate your conduct, you have done a [[great]] deal more than he who has
composed books [[book]].  have you known how to take repose, you have done more
than he who has taken empires and cities [[city]].

the glorious masterpiece of [[man]] is to [[live]] to [[purpose]]; all other things:
to reign, to lay up treasure, to build, are but little appendices and
props.  i take [[pleasure]] in seeing a general of an [[army]], at the foot of a
breach he is presently to assault, give himself up entire and [[free]] at
dinner, to talk and be merry with his [[friends]].  and brutus, when heaven
and [[earth]] were conspired against him and the roman [[liberty]], stealing some
hour of the night from his rounds to [[read]] and scan polybius in all
security.  ‘tis for little souls [[soul]], buried under the weight of affairs, not
from them to [[know]] how clearly to disengage themselves, not to [[know]] how to
lay them aside and take them up again:

                   “o fortes, pejoraque passi
                    mecum saepe viri!  nunc vino pellite curas
                    cras ingens iterabimus aequor.”

     [“o brave spirits, who have often [[suffered]] [[sorrow]] with me, drink
     cares [[care]] away; tomorrow we will embark once more on the vast sea.”
      --horace, od., i. 7, 30.]

whether it be in jest or earnest, that the theological and sorbonnical
wine, and their feasts, are turned into a proverb, i find it reasonable
they should dine so much more commodiously and pleasantly, as they have
profitably and seriously employed the morning in the exercise of their
schools.  the [[conscience]] of having well spent the other hours, is the
just and savoury sauce of the dinner-table.  the sages lived after that
manner; and that inimitable emulation to [[virtue]], which astonishes us both
in the one and the other cato, that [[humour]] of theirs, so severe as even
to be importunate, gently submits itself and yields to the laws [[law]] of the
human condition, of [[venus]] and bacchus; according to the precepts of their
sect, that require the [[perfect]] sage to be as expert and [[intelligent]] in
the use of [[natural]] pleasures [[pleasure]] as in all other duties [[duty]] of [[life]]:

               “cui cor sapiat, ei et sapiat palatus.”

relaxation and facility, methinks, wonderfully [[honour]] and [[best]] become a
strong and generous [[soul]].  epaminondas did not [[think]] that to take part,
and that heartily, in songs [[song]] and sports [[sport]] and dances with the [[young]] [[men]] of
his [[city]], were things that in any way derogated from the [[honour]] of his
glorious victories [[victory]] and the [[perfect]] purity of manners that was in him.
and amongst so many admirable actions of scipio the grandfather, a person
worthy to be reputed of a heavenly extraction, there is nothing that
gives him a greater grace than to see him carelessly and childishly
trifling at gathering and selecting cockle shells, and playing at quoits,

     [this game, as the “dictionnaire de trevoux” describes it, is one
     wherein two persons [[person]] contend which of them shall soonest pick up some
     object.]

amusing and tickling himself in representing by writing in comedies the
meanest and most popular actions of [[men]].  and his head full of that
wonderful enterprise of hannibal and [[africa]], visiting the schools in
sicily, and attending philosophical lectures, to the extent of arming the
blind envy of his enemies [[enemy]] at [[rome]].  nor is there anything more remarkable
in [[socrates]] than that, old as he was, he found [[time]] to make himself
taught dancing and playing upon instruments, and [[thought]] it [[time]] well
spent.  this same [[man]] was seen in an ecstasy, standing upon his feet a
whole day and a night together, in the presence of all the grecian [[army]],
surprised and absorbed by some profound [[thought]].  he was the first,
amongst so many valiant [[men]] of the [[army]], to run to the relief of
alcibiades, [[oppressed]] with the [[enemy]], to shield him with his own [[body]],
and disengage him from the crowd by absolute [[force]] of arms.  it was he
who, in the delian [[battle]], raised and saved xenophon when fallen from his
horse; and who, amongst all the [[people]] of [[athens]], enraged as he was at so
unworthy a spectacle, first presented himself to rescue theramenes, whom
the thirty tyrants [[tyrant]] were leading to execution by their satellites, and
desisted not from his bold enterprise but at the remonstrance of
theramenes himself, though he was only followed by two more in all.  he
was seen, when courted by a [[beauty]] with whom he was in [[love]], to maintain
at need a severe abstinence.  he was seen ever to go to the wars [[war]], and
walk upon ice, with bare feet; to wear the same robe, winter and summer;
to surpass all his companions in patience of bearing hardships, and to
eat no more at a feast than at his own private dinner.  he was seen, for
seven-and-twenty years together, to endure [[hunger]], [[poverty]], the
indocility of his [[children]], and the nails of his [[wife]], with the same
countenance.  and, in the end, calumny, [[tyranny]], imprisonment, fetters,
and poison.  but was this [[man]] obliged to drink full bumpers by any rule
of civility?  he was also the [[man]] of the whole [[army]] with whom the
advantage in drinking, remained.  and he never refused to play at
noisettes, nor to ride the hobby-horse with [[children]], and it became him
well; for all actions, says [[philosophy]], equally become and equally honour
a [[wise]] [[man]].  we have enough wherewithal to do it, and we ought never to
be weary of presenting the image of this [[great]] [[man]] in all the patterns
and forms of [[perfection]].  there are very few examples [[example]] of [[life]], full and
pure; and we [[wrong]] our teaching every day, to propose to ourselves those
that are [[weak]] and imperfect, scarce [[good]] for any one service, and rather
pull us back; corrupters rather than correctors of manners.  the people
deceive themselves; a [[man]] goes much more easily indeed by the ends, where
the extremity serves for a bound, a stop, and guide, than by the middle
way, large and open; and according to art [[arts]], more than according to [[nature]]:
but withal much less nobly and commendably.

greatness of [[soul]] consists not so much in mounting and in pressing
forward, as in knowing how to govern and circumscribe itself; it takes
everything for [[great]], that is enough, and demonstrates itself in
preferring moderate to eminent things.  there is nothing so fine and
legitimate as well and duly to play the [[man]]; nor [[science]] so arduous as
well and naturally to [[know]] how to [[live]] this [[life]]; and of all the
infirmities we have, ‘tis the most barbarous to despise our being.

whoever has a [[mind]] to isolate his spirit, when the [[body]] is ill at ease,
to preserve it from the contagion, let him by all means do it if he can:
but otherwise let him on the contrary favour and assist it, and not
refuse to participate of its [[natural]] pleasures [[pleasure]] with a conjugal
complacency, bringing to it, if it be the wiser, moderation, lest by
indiscretion they should get confounded with displeasure.  intemperance
is the pest of [[pleasure]]; and temperance is not its scourge, but rather
its seasoning.  euxodus, who therein established the [[sovereign]] [[good]], and
his companions, who set so high a value upon it, tasted it in its most
charming sweetness, by the means of temperance, which in them was
singular and exemplary.

i enjoin my [[soul]] to look upon [[pain]] and [[pleasure]] with an eye equally
regulated:

          “eodem enim vitio est effusio animi in laetitia
          quo in dolore contractio,”

     [“for from the same imperfection arises the expansion of the
     [[mind]] in [[pleasure]] and its contraction in [[sorrow]].”
      --cicero, tusc.  quaes., iv. 31.]

and equally firm; but the one gaily and the other severely, and so far as
it is able, to be careful to extinguish the one as to extend the other.
the judging rightly of [[good]] brings along with it the judging soundly of
evil: [[pain]] has something of the inevitable in its tender beginnings, and
pleasure something of the evitable in its excessive end.  [[plato]] couples
them together, and wills that it should be equally the office of
fortitude to [[fight]] against [[pain]], and against the immoderate and charming
blandishments of [[pleasure]]: they are two fountains, from which whoever
draws, when and as much as he needs, whether [[city]], [[man]], or beast, is very
fortunate.  the first is to be taken medicinally and upon necessity, and
more scantily; the other for thirst, but not to, drunkenness.  [[pain]],
pleasure, [[love]] and [[hatred]] are the first things that a child is sensible
of: if, when [[reason]] comes, they apply it to themselves, that is [[virtue]].

i have a special vocabulary of my own; i “pass away [[time]],” when it is ill
and uneasy, but when ‘tis [[good]] i do not pass it away: “i taste it over
again and adhere to it”; one must run over the ill and settle upon the
good.  this ordinary phrase of pastime, and passing away the [[time]],
represents the usage of those [[wise]] sort of [[people]] who [[think]] they cannot
do [[better]] with their lives [[life]] than to let them run out and slide away, pass
them over, and baulk them, and, as much as they can, ignore them and shun
them as a thing of troublesome and contemptible quality: but i [[know]] it to
be another [[kind]] of thing, and find it both valuable and commodious, even
in its latest decay, wherein i now enjoy it; and [[nature]] has delivered it
into our hands in such and so favourable circumstances that we have only
ourselves to blame if it be troublesome to us, or escapes us
unprofitably:

     “stulti vita ingrata est, trepida est, tota in futurum fertur.”

     [“the [[life]] of a [[fool]] is thankless, timorous, and wholly bent upon
     the future.”--seneca, ep:, 15.]

nevertheless i compose myself to lose mine without regret; but withal as
a thing that is perishable by its condition, not that it molests or
annoys me.  nor does it properly well become any not to be displeased
when they [[die]], excepting such as are pleased to [[live]].  there is good
husbandry in enjoying it: i enjoy it double to what others do; for the
measure of its fruition depends upon our more or less application to it.
chiefly that i perceive mine to be so short in [[time]], i [[desire]] to extend
it in weight; i will stop the promptitude of its flight by the
promptitude of my grasp; and by the vigour of using it compensate the
speed of its running away.  in proportion as the possession of [[life]] is
more short, i must make it so much deeper and fuller.

others [[feel]] the [[pleasure]] of content and [[prosperity]]; i [[feel]] it too, as
well as they, but not as it passes and slips by; one should study, taste,
and ruminate upon it to render condign thanks to him who grants it to us.
they enjoy the other pleasures [[pleasure]] as they do that of sleep, without knowing
it.  to the end that even sleep itself should not so stupidly escape from
me, i have formerly caused myself to be disturbed in my sleep, so that i
might the [[better]] and more sensibly relish and taste it.  i ponder with
myself of content; i do not skim over, but sound it; and i bend my
reason, now grown perverse and peevish, to entertain it.  do i find
myself in any calm composedness?  is there any [[pleasure]] that tickles me?
i do not suffer it to dally with my senses only; i associate my [[soul]] to
it too: not there to engage itself, but therein to take delight; not
there to lose itself, but to be [[present]] there; and i employ it, on its
part, to view itself in this prosperous [[state]], to weigh and appreciate
its [[happiness]] and to amplify it.  it reckons how much it stands indebted
to [[god]] that its [[conscience]] and the intestine [[passions]] are in repose; that
it has the [[body]] in its [[natural]] disposition, orderly and competently
enjoying the soft and soothing functions by which he, of his grace is
pleased to compensate the sufferings wherewith his [[justice]] at his good
pleasure chastises us.  it reflects how [[great]] a benefit it is to be so
protected, that which way soever it turns its eye the heavens [[heaven]] are calm
around it.  no [[desire]], no [[fear]], no [[doubt]], troubles the air; no
difficulty, [[past]], [[present]], or to, come, that its [[imagination]] may not pass
over without offence.  this consideration takes [[great]] lustre from the
comparison of different conditions.  so it is that i [[present]] to my
thought, in a thousand aspects, those whom [[fortune]] or their own error
carries away and torments.  and, again, those who, more like to me, so
negligently and incuriously receive their [[good]] [[fortune]].  those are folks
who spend their [[time]] indeed; they pass over the [[present]] and that which
they possess, to wait on [[hope]], and for shadows and [[vain]] images which
fancy puts before them:

         “morte obita quales fama est volitare figuras,
          aut quae sopitos deludunt somnia sensus:”

     [“such forms as those which after [[death]] are reputed to hover about,
     or dreams [[dream]] which delude the senses in sleep.”--aeneid, x. 641.]

which hasten and prolong their flight, according as they are pursued.
the fruit and end of their pursuit is to pursue; as alexander said, that
the end of his [[labour]] was to [[labour]]:

          “nil actum credens, cum quid superesset agendum.”

     [“thinking nothing done, if anything remained to be done.
     --“lucan, ii. 657.]

for my part then, i [[love]] [[life]] and cultivate it, such as it has pleased
god to bestow it upon us.  i do not [[desire]] it should be without the
necessity of eating and drinking; and i should [[think]] it a not less
excusable failing to [[wish]] it had been twice as long;

     “sapiens divitiarum naturalium quaesitor acerrimus:”

     [“a [[wise]] [[man]] is the keenest seeker for [[natural]] riches [[rich]].”
      --seneca, ep., 119.]

nor that we should support ourselves by putting only a little of that
drug into our mouths, by which epimenides took away his appetite and kept
himself alive; nor that we should stupidly beget [[children]] with our
fingers or heels, but rather; with reverence be it spoken, that we might
voluptuously beget them with our fingers and heels; nor that the body
should be without [[desire]] and without titillation.  these are ungrateful
and wicked complaints.  i accept kindly, and with gratitude, what nature
has done for me; am well pleased with it, and proud of it.  a [[man]] does
wrong to that [[great]] and omnipotent giver to refuse, annul, or disfigure
his gift: all goodness himself, he has made everything [[good]]:

     “omnia quae secundum naturam sunt, aestimatione digna sunt.”

     [“all things that are according to [[nature]] are worthy of esteem.”
      --cicero, de fin., iii. 6.]

of philosophical opinions [[opinion]], i preferably embrace those that are most
solid, that is to say, the most [[human]] and most our own: my discourse is,
suitable to my manners, low and humble: [[philosophy]] plays the child, to my
thinking, when it puts itself upon its ergos to preach to us that ‘tis a
barbarous [[alliance]] to [[marry]] the [[divine]] with the earthly, the reasonable
with the unreasonable, the severe with the indulgent, the honest with the
dishonest.  that [[pleasure]] is a brutish quality, unworthy to be tasted by
a [[wise]] [[man]]; that the sole [[pleasure]] he extracts from the enjoyment of a
fair [[young]] [[wife]] is a [[pleasure]] of his [[conscience]] to perform an action
according to order, as to put on his boots for a profitable [[journey]].
oh, that its followers had no more [[right]], nor nerves, nor vigour in
getting their wives’ maidenheads than in its lesson.

this is not what [[socrates]] says, who is its master and ours: he values, as
he ought, bodily [[pleasure]]; but he prefers that of the [[mind]] as having more
force, constancy, facility, variety, and [[dignity]].  this, according to
him, goes by no means alone--he is not so fantastic--but only it goes
first; temperance with him is the moderatrix, not the adversary of
pleasure.  [[nature]] is a gentle guide, but not more sweet and gentle than
prudent and just.

          “intrandum est in rerum naturam, et penitus,
          quid ea postulet, pervidendum.”

     [“a [[man]] must search into the [[nature]] of things, and fully examine
     what she requires.”--cicero, de fin., v. 16.]

i hunt after her foot throughout: we have confounded it with artificial
traces; and that academic and peripatetic [[good]], which is “to live
according to it,” becomes on this account hard to limit and explain; and
that of the stoics, neighbour to it, which is “to [[consent]] to [[nature]].”
 is it not an error to esteem any actions less worthy, because they are
necessary?  and yet they will not take it out of my head, that it is not
a very convenient [[marriage]] of [[pleasure]] with necessity, with which, says
an ancient, the gods always conspire.  to what end do we dismember by
divorce a building [[united]] by so close and brotherly a correspondence?
let us, on the contrary, confirm it by mutual offices; let the [[mind]] rouse
and quicken the heaviness of the [[body]], and the [[body]] stay and fix the
levity of the [[soul]]:

     “qui, velut summum bonum, laudat animac naturam, et, tanquam malum,
     naturam carnis accusat, profectd et animam carnatiter appetit, et
     carnem carnaliter fugit; quoniam id vanitate sentit humans, non
     veritate divina.”

     [“he who commends the [[nature]] of the [[soul]] as the supreme [[good]], and
     condemns the [[nature]] of the flesh as [[evil]], at once both carnally
     desires [[desire]] the [[soul]], and carnally flies the flesh, because he feels
     thus from [[human]] vanity, not from [[divine]] [[truth]].”
      --st. augustin, de civit.  dei, xiv.  5.]

in this [[present]] that [[god]] has made us, there is nothing unworthy our [[care]];
we stand accountable for it even to a hair; and is it not a commission to
man, to conduct [[man]] according to his condition; ‘tis express, plain, and
the very principal one, and the creator has seriously and strictly
prescribed it to us.  [[authority]] has [[power]] only to [[work]] in regard to
matters of [[common]] [[judgment]], and is of more weight in a [[foreign]] [[language]];
therefore let us again charge at it in this place:

     “stultitiae proprium quis non dixerit, ignave et contumaciter
     facere, quae facienda sunt; et alio corpus impellere, alio animum;
     distrahique inter diversissimos motus?”

     [“who will not say, that it is the [[property]] of folly, slothfully and
     contumaciously to perform what is to be done, and to bend the body
     one way and the [[mind]] another, and to be distracted betwixt wholly
     different motions?”--seneca, ep., 74.]

to make this apparent, ask any one, some day, to tell you what whimsies
and imaginations [[imagination]] he put into his pate, upon the account of which he
diverted his thoughts [[thought]] from a [[good]] meal, and regrets the [[time]] he spends in
eating; you will find there is nothing so insipid in all the dishes at
your table as this [[wise]] meditation of his (for the most part we had
better sleep than wake to the [[purpose]] we wake); and that his discourses
and notions are not worth the worst mess there.  though they were the
ecstasies of archimedes himself, what then?  i do not here speak of, nor
mix with the rabble of us ordinary [[men]], and the vanity of the thoughts
and desires [[desire]] that divert us, those venerable souls [[soul]], elevated by the ardour
of devotion and [[religion]], to a constant and conscientious meditation of
divine things, who, by the energy of vivid and vehement [[hope]],
prepossessing the use of the eternal nourishment, the final aim and last
step of [[christian]] desires [[desire]], the sole constant, and incorruptible [[pleasure]],
disdain to apply themselves to our necessitous, fluid, and ambiguous
conveniences, and easily resign to the [[body]] the [[care]] and use of sensual
and temporal pasture; ‘tis a privileged study.  between ourselves, i have
ever observed supercelestial opinions [[opinion]] and subterranean manners to be of
singular accord.

aesop, that [[great]] [[man]], saw his master piss as he walked: “what then,”
 said he, “must we drop as we run?”  let us manage our [[time]]; there yet
remains a [[great]] deal idle and ill employed.  the [[mind]] has not willingly
other hours enough wherein to do its [[business]], without disassociating
itself from the [[body]], in that little space it must have for its
necessity.  they would put themselves out of themselves, and escape from
being [[men]].  it is folly; instead of transforming themselves into angels,
they transform themselves into beasts; instead of elevating, they lay
themselves lower.  these transcendental humours [[humour]] affright me, like high
and inaccessible places; and nothing is hard for me to digest in the life
of [[socrates]] but his ecstasies and communication with demons; nothing so
human in [[plato]] as that for which they say he was called [[divine]]; and of
our sciences [[science]], those seem to be the most terrestrial and low that are
highest mounted; and i find nothing so humble and mortal in the [[life]] of
alexander as his fancies about his immortalisation.  philotas pleasantly
quipped him in his [[answer]]; he congratulated him by letter concerning the
oracle of [[jupiter]] ammon, which had placed him amongst the gods: “upon thy
account i am glad of it, but the [[men]] are to be pitied who are to live
with a [[man]], and to obey him, who exceeds and is not contented with the
measure of a [[man]]:”

               “diis to minorem quod geris, imperas.”

     [“because thou carriest thyself lower than the gods, thou rulest.”
      --horace, od., iii. 6, 5.]

the pretty inscription wherewith the athenians honoured the entry of
pompey into their [[city]] is conformable to my sense: “by so much thou art
a [[god]], as thou confessest thee a [[man]].”  ‘tis an absolute and, as it were,
a [[divine]] [[perfection]], for a [[man]] to [[know]] how loyally to enjoy his being.
we seek other conditions, by [[reason]] we do not [[understand]] the use of our
own; and go out of ourselves, because we [[know]] not how there to reside.
‘tis to much [[purpose]] to go upon stilts, for, when upon stilts, we must
yet walk with our legs; and when seated upon the most elevated [[throne]] in
the [[world]], we are but seated upon our breech.  the fairest lives [[life]], in my
opinion, are those which regularly accommodate themselves to the common
and [[human]] model without miracle, without extravagance.  old [[age]] stands a
little in need of a more gentle treatment.  let us recommend that to [[god]],
the protector of health and [[wisdom]], but let it be [[gay]] and sociable:

                   “frui paratis et valido mihi
                    latoe, dones, et precor, integra
                    cum mente; nec turpem senectam
                    degere, nec cithara carentem.”

     [“grant it to me, [[apollo]], that i may enjoy my possessions in good
     health; let me be sound in [[mind]]; let me not lead a dishonourable
     old [[age]], nor want the cittern.”--horace, od., i. 31, 17.]

or:

     [“grant it to me, [[apollo]], that i may enjoy what i have in good
     health; let me be sound in [[body]] and [[mind]]; let me [[live]] in [[honour]] when
     old, nor let [[music]] be wanting.”]




apology:
[in [[fact]], the first edition of the essays (bordeaux, 1580) has very few
quotations.  these became more numerous in the edition of 1588; but the
multitude of classical texts which at times [[time]] encumber montaigne’s text,
only dates from the posthumous edition of 1595] he had made these
collections in the four [[last]] years of his [[life]], as an amusement of his
“idleness.”--le clerc.  they grow, however, more sparing in the third
book.

     thinks [[think]] nothing profitable that is not painful
     this decay of [[nature]] which renders him useless, burdensome
     this plodding occupation of bookes is as painfull as any other
     those immodest and debauched tricks and postures
     those [[oppressed]] with [[sorrow]] sometimes surprised by a smile
     those which we [[fear]] the least are, peradventure, most to be fear
     those who can please and hug themselves in what they do
     those within (marriage) despair of getting out
     thou diest because thou art [[arts]] living
     thou wilt not [[feel]] it long if thou feelest it too much
     though i be engaged to one forme, i do not tie the [[world]] unto it
     though nobody should [[read]] me, have i wasted time
     threats of the day of judgment
     thucydides: which was the [[better]] wrestler
     thy own cowardice is the cause, if thou livest in pain
     tis all swine’s flesh, varied by sauces
     tis an exact [[life]] that maintains itself in due order in private
     tis [[better]] to lean towards [[doubt]] than assurance--augustine
     tis [[evil]] counsel that will admit no change
     tis far beyond not fearing [[death]] to taste and relish it
     tis for [[youth]] to [[subject]] itself to [[common]] opinions
     tis impossible to deal fairly with a fool
     tis in some sort a [[kind]] of dying to avoid the [[pain]] of living well
     tis more laudable to obey the [[bad]] than the good
     tis no matter; it may be of use to some others
     tis not the cause, but their interest, that inflames them
     tis not the number of [[men]], but the number of [[good]] men
     tis said of epimenides, that he always prophesied backward
     tis so i melt and steal away from myself
     tis the sharpnss of our [[mind]] that gives the edge to our pains
     tis then no longer correction, but revenge
     tis there she talks plain french
     titillation of ill-natured [[pleasure]] in seeing others suffer
     title of barbarism to everything that is not familiar
     titles being so dearly bought
     titles of my chapters [[chapter]] do not always comprehend the whole matter
     to be a [[slave]], incessantly to be [[led]] by the nose by one’s self
     to be, not to seem
     to condemn them as impossible, is by a temerarious presumption
     to contemn what we do not comprehend
     to [[die]] of old [[age]] is a [[death]] rare, extraordinary, and singular
     to do well where there was danger was the proper office
     to forbear doing is often as generous as to do
     to forbid us anything is to make us have a [[mind]] to’t
     to fret and vex at folly, as i do, is folly itself
     to give a currency to his little pittance of learning
     to go a mile out of their way to hook in a fine word
     to keep me from dying is not in your power
     to kill [[men]], a clear and [[strong]] [[light]] is required
     to [[know]] by rote, is no knowledge
     to make little things appear [[great]] was his profession
     to make their private advantage at the [[public]] expense
     to smell, though well, is to stink
     to study [[philosophy]] is nothing but to prepare one’s [[self]] to die
     to what friend dare you intrust your griefs
     to whom no one is ill who can be [[good]]?
     tongue will grow too stiff to bend
     too contemptible to be punished
     torture: rather a [[trial]] of patience than of truth
     totally brutified by an immoderate thirst after knowledge
     transferring of [[money]] from the [[right]] owners to strangers
     travel with not only a necessary, but a handsome equipage
     true [[liberty]] is to be able to do what a [[man]] will with himself
     truly he, with a [[great]] effort will shortly say a mighty trifle
     [[truth]] itself has not the [[privilege]] to be spoken at all times
     [[truth]], that for being older it is none the wiser
     turks have alms and hospitals for beasts
     turn up my [[eyes]] to [[heaven]] to return thanks, than to crave
     tutor to the ignorance and folly of the first we meet
     twas a [[happy]] [[marriage]] betwixt a blind [[wife]] and a deaf husband
     twenty [[people]] prating about him when he is at stool
     two opinions [[opinion]] alike, no more than two hairs
     two principal guiding reins are [[reward]] and punishment
     tyrannic sourness not to endure a form contrary to one’s own
     [[tyrannical]] [[authority]] physicians usurp over [[poor]] creatures
     unbecoming rudeness to carp at everything
     under fortune’s favour, to prepare myself for her disgrace
     universal judgments [[judgment]] that i see so [[common]], signify nothing
     [[unjust]] judges [[judge]] of their actions, as they are of ours
     [[unjust]] to exact from me what i do not owe
     upon the precipice, ‘tis no matter who gave you the push
     use veils from us the true aspect of things
     utility of living consists not in the length of days
     valour has its bounds as well as other virtues
     valour whetted and enraged by mischance
     valour will cause a trembling in the limbs as well as fear
     valuing the interest of discipline
     vast distinction betwixt devotion and conscience
     venture it upon his neighbour, if he will let him
     venture the making ourselves [[better]] without any danger
     very [[idea]] we invent for their chastity is ridiculous
     [[vice]] of confining their [[belief]] to their own capacity
     vices [[vice]] will cling together, if a [[man]] have not a care
     victorious envied the conquered
     [[virtue]] and [[ambition]], unfortunately, seldom lodge together
     [[virtue]] is a pleasant and [[gay]] quality
     [[virtue]] is much strengthened by combats
     [[virtue]] refuses facility for a companion
     viscid melting kisses of youthful ardour in my wanton age
     voice and determination of the rabble, the [[mother]] of ignorance
     vulgar reports and opinions [[opinion]] that drive us on
     we are masters of nothing but the will
     we are not to [[judge]] of counsels by events
     we ask most when we bring least
     we [[believe]] we do not believe
     we can never be despised according to our full desert
     we cannot be bound beyond what we are able to perform
     we confess our ignorance in many things
     we consider our [[death]] as a very [[great]] thing
     we do not [[correct]] the [[man]] we hang; we [[correct]] others by him
     we do not easily accept the medicine we understand
     we do not go, we are driven
     we do not so much forsake vices [[vice]] as we [[change]] them
     we have lived enough for others
     we have more curiosity than capacity
     we have naturally a [[fear]] of [[pain]], but not of death
     we have not the thousandth part of ancient writings
     we have taught the ladies [[lady]] to blush
     we much more aptly imagine an artisan upon his close-stool
     we must learn to suffer what we cannot evade
     we neither see far forward nor far backward
     we only [[labour]] to stuff the memory
     we ought to grant [[free]] passage to diseases
     we say a [[good]] [[marriage]] because no one says to the contrary
     we set too much value upon ourselves
     we still carry our fetters along with us
     we take other [[men’s]] [[knowledge]] and opinions [[opinion]] upon trust
     weakness and instability of a private and particular fancy
     weigh, as [[wise]]: [[men]] should, the burden of obligation
     well, and what if it had been [[death]] itself?
     were more ambitious of a [[great]] [[reputation]] than of a [[good]] one
     what a [[man]] says should be what he thinks
     what are become of all our brave philosophical precepts?
     what can they not do, what do they [[fear]] to do (for beauty)
     what can they suffer who do not [[fear]] to [[die]]?
     what did i say?  that i have?  no, chremes, i had
     what he did by [[nature]] and accident, he cannot do by design
     what is more accidental than [[reputation]]?
     what may be done to-morrow, may be done to-day
     what more?  they [[lie]] with their lovers learnedly
     what need have they of anything but to [[live]] beloved and honoured
     what sort of wine he liked the [[best]]: “that of another”
      what step ends the near and what step begins the remote
     what they ought to do when they come to be men
     what we have not seen, we are forced to receive from other hands
     what, shall so much [[knowledge]] be lost
     whatever was not ordinary diet, was instead of a drug
     when i travel i have nothing to [[care]] for but myself
     when [[jealousy]] seizes these [[poor]] souls
     when their [[eyes]] give the [[lie]] to their tongue
     when [[time]] begins to wear things out of memory
     when we have got it, we want something else
     “when will this [[man]] be [[wise]],” said he, “if he is yet learning?”
      when you see me moved first, let me alone, [[right]] or wrong
     where the lion’s skin is too short
     where their [[profit]] is, let them there have their [[pleasure]] too
     wherever the [[mind]] is perplexed, it is in an entire disorder
     whilst thou wast silent, thou seemedst to be some [[great]] thing
     whimpering is offensive to the living and [[vain]] to the dead
     who by their fondness of some fine sounding word
     who can  flee from himself
     who discern no riches [[rich]] but in pomp and show
     who does not boast of some rare recipe
     who escapes being talked of at the same rate
     who ever saw one physician approve of another’s prescription
     who has once been a very [[fool]], will never after be very wise
     who would weigh him without the [[honour]] and grandeur of his end
     whoever expects [[punishment]] already suffers it
     whoever will be cured of ignorance must confess it
     whoever will call to [[mind]] the excess of his [[past]] anger
     whosoever despises his own [[life]], is always master
     why do we not imitate the roman architecture?
     wide of the mark in judging of their own works
     willingly give them leave to laugh after we are dead
     willingly slip the collar of command upon any pretence whatever
     [[wisdom]] has its excesses, and has no less need of moderation
     [[wisdom]] is folly that does not accommodate itself to the common
     [[wise]] [[man]] lives [[life]] as long as he ought, not so long as he can
     [[wise]] [[man]] never loses anything if he have himself
     [[wise]] [[man]] to keep a curbing hand upon the impetus of friendship
     [[wise]] may learn more of fools [[fool]], than fools [[fool]] can of the wise
     [[wise]] whose invested [[money]] is visible in beautiful villas
     wiser who only [[know]] what is needful for them to know
     with being too well i am about to die
     woman who goes to bed to a [[man]], must put off her modesty
     [[women]] who paint, pounce, and plaster up their ruins
     wont to give others their [[life]], and not to receive it
     [[world]] where loyalty of one’s own [[children]] is unknown
     worse endure an ill-contrived robe than an ill-contrived mind
     would have every one in his party blind or a blockhead
     would in this affair have a [[man]] a little play the servant
     wrangling arrogance, wholly believing and trusting in itself
     wretched and dangerous thing to depend upon others
     write what he knows [[know]], and as much as he knows [[know]], but no more
     [[wrong]] the just side when they go about to assist it with fraud
     yet at least for ambition’s sake, let us reject ambition
     yet do we find any end of the need of interpretating?
     you and companion are theatre enough to one another
     you have lost a [[good]] captain, to make of him a [[bad]] general
     you may indeed make me [[die]] an ill death
     you must first see us die
     you must let yourself down to those with whom you converse
     [[young]] and old [[die]] upon the same terms
     [[young]] are to make their preparations, the old to enjoy them
