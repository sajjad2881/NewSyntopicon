dedication

to the magnificent lorenzo di piero de’ medici

those who strive to obtain the [[good]] graces of a [[prince]] are accustomed to come before him with such things as they hold most precious, or in which they see him take most delight; whence one often sees horses, arms, cloth of gold, precious stones, and similar ornaments presented to princes [[prince]], worthy of their greatness.
desiring therefore to [[present]] myself to your magnificence with some testimony of my devotion towards you, i have not found among my possessions anything which i hold more dear than, or value so much as, the [[knowledge]] of the actions of [[great]] [[men]], acquired by long [[experience]] in contemporary affairs, and a continual study of antiquity; which, having reflected upon it with [[great]] and prolonged diligence, i now send, digested into a little volume, to your magnificence.
and although i may consider this [[work]] unworthy of your countenance, nevertheless i trust much to your benignity that it may be acceptable, seeing that it is not possible for me to make a [[better]] gift than to offer you the opportunity of understanding in the shortest [[time]] all that i have learnt in so many years, and with so many troubles and dangers; which [[work]] i have not embellished with swelling or magnificent words, nor stuffed with rounded periods, nor with any extrinsic allurements or adornments whatever, with which so many are accustomed to embellish their works [[work]]; for i have wished either that no [[honour]] should be given it, or else that the [[truth]] of the matter and the weightiness of the theme shall make it acceptable.
nor do i hold with those who regard it as a presumption if a [[man]] of low and humble condition dare to discuss and settle the concerns of princes [[prince]]; because, just as those who draw landscapes place themselves below in the plain to contemplate the [[nature]] of the mountains and of lofty places, and in order to contemplate the plains place themselves upon high mountains, even so to [[understand]] the [[nature]] of the [[people]] it needs to be a [[prince]], and to [[understand]] that of princes [[prince]] it needs to be of the [[people]].
take then, your magnificence, this little gift in the spirit in which i send it; wherein, if it be diligently [[read]] and considered by you, you will learn my extreme [[desire]] that you should attain that greatness which [[fortune]] and your other attributes promise. and if your magnificence from the summit of your greatness will sometimes turn your [[eyes]] to these lower regions, you will see how unmeritedly i suffer a [[great]] and continued malignity of [[fortune]].

chapter i.
how many kinds [[kind]] of principalities there are, and by what means they are acquired

all states, all powers [[power]], that have held and hold [[rule]] over [[men]] have been and are either republics [[republic]] or principalities.
principalities are either hereditary, in which the [[family]] has been long established; or they are new.
the new are either entirely new, as was milan to francesco sforza, or they are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary [[state]] of the [[prince]] who has acquired them, as was the [[kingdom]] of naples to that of the [[king]] of [[spain]].
such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to [[live]] under a [[prince]], or to [[live]] in [[freedom]]; and are acquired either by the arms of the [[prince]] himself, or of others, or else by [[fortune]] or by ability.
chapter ii.
concerning hereditary principalities

i will leave out all discussion on republics [[republic]], inasmuch as in another place i have written of them at length, and will address myself only to principalities. in doing so i will keep to the order indicated above, and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.
i say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states, and those long accustomed to the [[family]] of their [[prince]], than new ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of his [[ancestors]], and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, for a [[prince]] of average powers [[power]] to maintain himself in his [[state]], unless he be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive [[force]]; and if he should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the usurper, he will regain it.
we have in [[italy]], for [[example]], the duke of ferrara, who could not have withstood the attacks of the venetians in ’84, nor those of [[pope]] julius in ’10, unless he had been long established in his dominions. for the hereditary [[prince]] has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it happens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices [[vice]] cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects [[subject]] will be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and duration of his [[rule]] the memories and motives that make for [[change]] are lost, for one [[change]] always leaves the toothing for another.
chapter iii.
concerning mixed principalities

but the difficulties occur in a new principality. and firstly, if it be not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a [[state]] which, taken collectively, may be called composite, the changes [[change]] arise chiefly from an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for [[men]] [[change]] their rulers willingly, hoping to [[better]] themselves, and this [[hope]] induces them to take up arms against him who rules [[rule]]: wherein they are deceived, because they afterwards find by [[experience]] they have gone from [[bad]] to worse. this follows also on another [[natural]] and [[common]] necessity, which always causes a new [[prince]] to burden those who have submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships which he must put upon his new acquisition.
in this way you have enemies [[enemy]] in all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those [[friends]] who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the way they expected, and you cannot take [[strong]] measures against them, feeling bound to them. for, although one may be very [[strong]] in armed forces [[force]], yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill of the natives.
for these reasons [[reason]] louis the twelfth, [[king]] of [[france]], quickly occupied milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first [[time]] it only needed lodovico’s own forces [[force]]; because those who had opened the gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes [[hope]] of future benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new [[prince]]. it is very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second [[time]], they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the [[prince]], with little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the weakest places. thus to cause [[france]] to lose milan the first [[time]] it was enough for the duke lodovico[1] to raise insurrections on the borders; but to cause him to lose it a second [[time]] it was necessary to bring the whole [[world]] against him, and that his armies [[army]] should be defeated and driven out of [[italy]]; which followed from the causes above mentioned.
[1] duke lodovico was lodovico moro, a [[son]] of francesco sforza, who [[married]] beatrice d’este. he ruled over milan from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510.

nevertheless milan was taken from [[france]] both the first and the second [[time]]. the general reasons [[reason]] for the first have been discussed; it remains to name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and what any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more securely in his acquisition than did the [[king]] of [[france]].
now i say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an ancient [[state]] by him who acquires them, are either of the same [[country]] and [[language]], or they are not. when they are, it is easier to hold them, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the [[family]] of the [[prince]] who was ruling them; because the two peoples [[people]], preserving in other things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will [[live]] quietly together, as one has seen in brittany, burgundy, gascony, and normandy, which have been bound to [[france]] for so long a [[time]]: and, although there may be some difference in [[language]], nevertheless the customs are alike, and the [[people]] will easily be able to get on amongst themselves. he who has annexed them, if he wishes [[wish]] to hold them, has only to bear in [[mind]] two considerations: the one, that the [[family]] of their former [[lord]] is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws [[law]] nor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short [[time]] they will become entirely one [[body]] with the old principality.
but when states are acquired in a [[country]] differing in [[language]], customs, or laws [[law]], there are difficulties, and [[good]] [[fortune]] and [[great]] energy are needed to hold them, and one of the [[greatest]] and most real helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there. this would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made that of the turk in greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures taken by him for holding that [[state]], if he had not settled there, would not have been able to keep it. because, if one is on the spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are [[great]], and then one can no longer remedy them. besides this, the [[country]] is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects [[subject]] are satisfied by prompt recourse to the [[prince]]; thus, wishing to be [[good]], they have more cause to [[love]] him, and wishing to be otherwise, to [[fear]] him. he who would attack that [[state]] from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the [[prince]] resides there it can only be wrested from him with the [[greatest]] difficulty.
the other and [[better]] course is to send colonies to one or two places, which may be as keys to that [[state]], for it is necessary either to do this or else to keep there a [[great]] number of cavalry and infantry. a [[prince]] does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of the [[citizens]] from whom he takes lands [[land]] and houses to give them to the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining [[poor]] and scattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same [[time]] are anxious not to err for [[fear]] it should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled. in conclusion, i say that these colonies are not costly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being [[poor]] and scattered, cannot hurt. upon this, one has to remark that [[men]] ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a [[man]] ought to be of such a [[kind]] that one does not stand in [[fear]] of [[revenge]].
but in maintaining armed [[men]] there in place of colonies one spends much more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the [[state]], so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are exasperated, because the whole [[state]] is injured; through the shifting of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and all become hostile, and they are enemies [[enemy]] who, whilst beaten on their own ground, are yet able to do hurt. for every [[reason]], therefore, such guards are as useless as a colony is useful.
again, the [[prince]] who holds a [[country]] differing in the above respects [[respect]] ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking [[care]] that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of [[ambition]] or through [[fear]], as one has seen already. the romans were brought into greece by the ætolians; and in every other [[country]] where they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. and the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a [[country]], all the [[subject]] states are drawn to him, moved by the [[hatred]] which they [[feel]] against the ruling [[power]]. so that in [[respect]] to those [[subject]] states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the [[state]] which he has acquired there. he has only to take [[care]] that they do not get hold of too much [[power]] and too much [[authority]], and then with his own forces [[force]], and with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them, so as to remain entirely master in the [[country]]. and he who does not properly manage this [[business]] will soon lose what he has acquired, and whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles.
the romans, in the countries [[country]] which they annexed, observed closely these measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with[2] the minor powers [[power]], without increasing their [[strength]]; they kept down the greater, and did not allow any [[strong]] [[foreign]] powers [[power]] to gain [[authority]]. greece appears to me sufficient for an [[example]]. the achaeans and ætolians were kept friendly by them, the [[kingdom]] of macedonia was humbled, antiochus was driven out; yet the merits [[merit]] of the achaeans and ætolians never secured for them permission to increase their [[power]], nor did the persuasions of philip ever induce the romans to be his [[friends]] without first humbling him, nor did the influence of antiochus make them agree that he should retain any lordship over the [[country]]. because the romans did in these instances what all prudent princes [[prince]] ought to do, who have to regard not only [[present]] troubles, but also future ones, for which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine is no longer in [[time]] because the malady has become incurable; for it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of [[time]], not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure. thus it happens in affairs of [[state]], for when the evils [[evil]] that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a [[wise]] [[man]] to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them, there is no longer a remedy. therefore, the romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a [[war]], would not let them come to a head, for they knew that [[war]] is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to [[fight]] with philip and antiochus in greece so as not to have to do it in [[italy]]; they could have avoided both, but this they did not [[wish]]; nor did that ever please them which is forever in the mouths of the [[wise]] ones of our [[time]]:—let us enjoy the benefits of the time—but rather the benefits of their own valour and prudence, for [[time]] drives everything before it, and is able to bring with it [[good]] as well as [[evil]], and [[evil]] as well as [[good]].
[2] see remark in the introduction on the word “intrattenere.”

but let us turn to [[france]] and inquire whether she has done any of the things mentioned. i will speak of louis[3] (and not of charles)[4] as the one whose conduct is the [[better]] to be observed, he having held possession of [[italy]] for the longest period; and you will see that he has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a [[state]] composed of divers elements.
[3] louis xii, [[king]] of [[france]], “the [[father]] of the [[people]],” born 1462, died 1515.

[4] charles viii, [[king]] of [[france]], born 1470, died 1498.

king louis was brought into [[italy]] by the [[ambition]] of the venetians, who [[desired]] to obtain half the [[state]] of lombardy by his intervention. i will not blame the course taken by the [[king]], because, wishing to get a foothold in [[italy]], and having no [[friends]] there—seeing rather that every door was shut to him owing to the conduct of charles—he was forced to accept those friendships [[friendship]] which he could get, and he would have succeeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some mistakes. the [[king]], however, having acquired lombardy, regained at once the [[authority]] which charles had lost: genoa yielded; the florentines became his [[friends]]; the marquess of mantua, the duke of ferrara, the bentivogli, my [[lady]] of forli, the lords [[lord]] of faenza, of pesaro, of rimini, of camerino, of piombino, the lucchese, the pisans, the sienese—everybody made advances to him to become his friend. then could the venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them, which, in order that they might secure two towns in lombardy, had made the [[king]] master of two-thirds of [[italy]].
let any one now consider with what little difficulty the [[king]] could have maintained his position in [[italy]] had he observed the rules [[rule]] above laid down, and kept all his [[friends]] secure and protected; for although they were numerous they were both [[weak]] and timid, some afraid of the [[church]], some of the venetians, and thus they would always have been forced to stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have made himself secure against those who remained powerful. but he was no sooner in milan than he did the contrary by assisting [[pope]] alexander to occupy the romagna. it never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening himself, depriving himself of [[friends]] and of those who had thrown themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the [[church]] by adding much temporal [[power]] to the [[spiritual]], thus giving it greater [[authority]]. and having committed this prime error, he was obliged to [[follow]] it up, so much so that, to put an end to the [[ambition]] of alexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of tuscany, he was himself forced to come into [[italy]].
and as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the [[church]], and deprived himself of [[friends]], he, wishing to have the [[kingdom]] of naples, divided it with the [[king]] of [[spain]], and where he was the prime arbiter in [[italy]] he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that [[country]] and the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and whereas he could have left in the [[kingdom]] his own pensioner as [[king]], he drove him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, louis, out in turn.
the [[wish]] to acquire is in [[truth]] very [[natural]] and [[common]], and [[men]] always do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but when they cannot do so, yet [[wish]] to do so by any means, then there is folly and blame. therefore, if [[france]] could have attacked naples with her own forces [[force]] she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she ought not to have divided it. and if the partition which she made with the venetians in lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she got a foothold in [[italy]], this other partition merited blame, for it had not the excuse of that necessity.
therefore louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers [[power]], he increased the [[strength]] of one of the greater powers [[power]] in [[italy]], he brought in a [[foreign]] [[power]], he did not settle in the [[country]], he did not send colonies. which errors, had he lived, were not enough to injure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from the venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the [[church]], nor brought [[spain]] into [[italy]], it would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have consented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have kept off others from designs on lombardy, to which the venetians would never have consented except to become masters themselves there; also because the others would not [[wish]] to take lombardy from [[france]] in order to give it to the venetians, and to run counter to both they would not have had the [[courage]].
and if any one should say: “king louis yielded the romagna to alexander and the [[kingdom]] to [[spain]] to avoid [[war]],” i [[answer]] for the reasons [[reason]] given above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid [[war]], because it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage. and if another should allege the pledge which the [[king]] had given to the [[pope]] that he would assist him in the enterprise, in exchange for the dissolution of his marriage[5] and for the cap to rouen,[6] to that i reply what i shall write later on concerning the [[faith]] of princes [[prince]], and how it ought to be kept.
[5] louis xii divorced his [[wife]], jeanne, [[daughter]] of louis xi, and [[married]] in 1499 anne of brittany, widow of charles viii, in order to retain the duchy of brittany for the [[crown]].

[6] the archbishop of rouen. he was georges d’amboise, created a cardinal by alexander vi. born 1460, died 1510.

thus [[king]] louis lost lombardy by not having followed any of the conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries [[country]] and wished to retain them. nor is there any miracle in this, but much that is reasonable and quite [[natural]]. and on these matters i spoke at nantes with rouen, when valentino, as cesare borgia, the [[son]] of [[pope]] alexander, was usually called, occupied the romagna, and on cardinal rouen observing to me that the italians did not [[understand]] [[war]], i replied to him that the french did not [[understand]] statecraft, meaning that otherwise they would not have allowed the [[church]] to reach such greatness. and in [[fact]] it has been seen that the greatness of the [[church]] and of [[spain]] in [[italy]] has been caused by [[france]], and her ruin may be attributed to them. from this a general [[rule]] is drawn which never or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by astuteness or else by [[force]], and both are distrusted by him who has been raised to [[power]].
chapter iv.
why the [[kingdom]] of darius, conquered by alexander, did not rebel against the successors of alexander at his death

considering the difficulties which [[men]] have had to hold to a newly acquired [[state]], some might wonder how, seeing that alexander the [[great]] became the master of [[asia]] in a few years, and died whilst it was scarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole [[empire]] would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained themselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose among themselves from their own ambitions.
i [[answer]] that the principalities of which one has record are found to be governed in two different ways; either by a [[prince]], with a [[body]] of servants, who assist him to govern the [[kingdom]] as ministers by his favour and permission; or by a [[prince]] and barons, who hold that [[dignity]] by antiquity of [[blood]] and not by the grace of the [[prince]]. such barons have states and their own subjects [[subject]], who recognize them as lords [[lord]] and hold them in [[natural]] affection. those states that are governed by a [[prince]] and his servants hold their [[prince]] in more consideration, because in all the [[country]] there is no one who is recognized as superior to him, and if they yield [[obedience]] to another they do it as to a minister and official, and they do not bear him any particular affection.
the examples [[example]] of these two governments [[government]] in our [[time]] are the turk and the [[king]] of [[france]]. the entire [[monarchy]] of the turk is governed by one [[lord]], the others are his servants; and, dividing his [[kingdom]] into sanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and changes [[change]] them as he chooses. but the [[king]] of [[france]] is placed in the midst of an ancient [[body]] of lords [[lord]], acknowledged by their own subjects [[subject]], and beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the [[king]] take these away except at his peril. therefore, he who considers both of these states will recognize [[great]] difficulties in seizing the [[state]] of the turk, but, once it is conquered, [[great]] ease in holding it. the causes of the difficulties in seizing the [[kingdom]] of the turk are that the usurper cannot be called in by the princes [[prince]] of the [[kingdom]], nor can he [[hope]] to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the [[lord]] has around him. this arises from the reasons [[reason]] given above; for his ministers, being all slaves [[slave]] and bondmen, can only be corrupted with [[great]] difficulty, and one can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted, as they cannot carry the [[people]] with them, for the reasons [[reason]] assigned. hence, he who attacks the turk must bear in [[mind]] that he will find him [[united]], and he will have to rely more on his own [[strength]] than on the revolt of others; but, if once the turk has been conquered, and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies [[army]], there is nothing to [[fear]] but the [[family]] of this [[prince]], and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to [[fear]], the others having no credit with the [[people]]; and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his [[victory]], so he ought not to [[fear]] them after it.
the contrary happens in kingdoms [[kingdom]] governed like that of [[france]], because one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the [[kingdom]], for one always finds malcontents and such as [[desire]] a [[change]]. such [[men]], for the reasons [[reason]] given, can open the way into the [[state]] and render the [[victory]] easy; but if you [[wish]] to hold it afterwards, you meet with infinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from those you have crushed. nor is it enough for you to have exterminated the [[family]] of the [[prince]], because the lords [[lord]] that remain make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either to satisfy or exterminate them, that [[state]] is lost whenever [[time]] brings the opportunity.
now if you will consider what was the [[nature]] of the [[government]] of darius, you will find it similar to the [[kingdom]] of the turk, and therefore it was only necessary for alexander, first to overthrow him in the field, and then to take the [[country]] from him. after which [[victory]], darius being killed, the [[state]] remained secure to alexander, for the above reasons [[reason]]. and if his successors had been [[united]] they would have enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults raised in the [[kingdom]] except those they provoked themselves.
but it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted like that of [[france]]. hence arose those frequent rebellions against the romans in [[spain]], [[france]], and greece, owing to the many principalities there were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them endured, the romans always held an insecure possession; but with the [[power]] and long continuance of the [[empire]] the memory of them passed away, and the romans then became secure possessors. and when fighting afterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself his own parts of the [[country]], according to the [[authority]] he had assumed there; and the [[family]] of the former [[lord]] being exterminated, none other than the romans were acknowledged.
when these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with which alexander held the [[empire]] of [[asia]], or at the difficulties which others have had to keep an acquisition, such as pyrrhus and many more; this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the conqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the [[subject]] [[state]].
chapter v.
concerning the way to govern cities [[city]] or principalities which lived under their own laws [[law]] before they were annexed

whenever those states which have been acquired as stated have been accustomed to [[live]] under their own laws [[law]] and in [[freedom]], there are three courses for those who [[wish]] to hold them: the first is to ruin them, the next is to reside there in [[person]], the third is to permit them to [[live]] under their own laws [[law]], drawing a tribute, and establishing within it an [[oligarchy]] which will keep it friendly to you. because such a [[government]], being created by the [[prince]], knows [[know]] that it cannot stand without his [[friendship]] and interest, and does its utmost to support him; and therefore he who would keep a [[city]] accustomed to [[freedom]] will hold it more easily by the means of its own [[citizens]] than in any other way.
there are, for [[example]], the spartans and the romans. the spartans held [[athens]] and thebes, establishing there an [[oligarchy]]: nevertheless they lost them. the romans, in order to hold capua, [[carthage]], and numantia, dismantled them, and did not lose them. they wished to hold greece as the spartans held it, making it [[free]] and permitting its laws [[law]], and did not succeed. so to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities [[city]] in the [[country]], for in [[truth]] there is no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruining them. and he who becomes master of a [[city]] accustomed to [[freedom]] and does not [[destroy]] it, may expect to be destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of [[liberty]] and its ancient privileges [[privilege]] as a rallying point, which neither [[time]] nor benefits will ever cause it to forget. and whatever you may do or provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges [[privilege]] unless they are disunited or dispersed, but at every [[chance]] they immediately rally to them, as pisa after the hundred years she had been held in bondage by the florentines.
but when cities [[city]] or countries [[country]] are accustomed to [[live]] under a [[prince]], and his [[family]] is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old [[prince]], cannot agree in making one from amongst themselves, and they do not [[know]] how to govern themselves. for this [[reason]] they are very slow to take up arms, and a [[prince]] can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily. but in republics [[republic]] there is more vitality, greater [[hatred]], and more [[desire]] for vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of their former [[liberty]] to rest; so that the safest way is to [[destroy]] them or to reside there.
chapter vi.
concerning new principalities which are acquired by one’s own arms and ability

let no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities as i shall do, i adduce the highest examples [[example]] both of [[prince]] and of [[state]]; because [[men]], walking almost always in paths beaten by others, and following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely to the ways of others or attain to the [[power]] of those they imitate. a [[wise]] [[man]] ought always to [[follow]] the paths beaten by [[great]] [[men]], and to imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not [[equal]] theirs, at least it will savour of it. let him act like the clever archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far distant, and knowing the limits to which the [[strength]] of their bow attains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their [[strength]] or arrow to so [[great]] a height, but to be able with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they [[wish]] to reach.
i say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is a new [[prince]], more or less difficulty is found in keeping them, accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired the [[state]]. now, as the [[fact]] of becoming a [[prince]] from a private station presupposes either ability or [[fortune]], it is clear that one or other of these things will mitigate in some [[degree]] many difficulties. nevertheless, he who has relied least on [[fortune]] is established the strongest. further, it facilitates matters when the [[prince]], having no other [[state]], is compelled to reside there in [[person]].
but to come to those who, by their own ability and not through [[fortune]], have risen to be princes [[prince]], i say that [[moses]], cyrus, romulus, theseus, and such like are the most excellent examples [[example]]. and although one may not discuss [[moses]], he having been a mere executor of the will of [[god]], yet he ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy to speak with [[god]]. but in considering cyrus and others who have acquired or founded kingdoms [[kingdom]], all will be found admirable; and if their particular deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be found inferior to those of [[moses]], although he had so [[great]] a preceptor. and in examining their actions and lives [[life]] one cannot see that they owed anything to [[fortune]] beyond opportunity, which brought them the material to mould into the form which seemed [[best]] to them. without that opportunity their powers [[power]] of [[mind]] would have been extinguished, and without those powers [[power]] the opportunity would have come in [[vain]].
it was necessary, therefore, to [[moses]] that he should find the [[people]] of [[israel]] in [[egypt]] enslaved and [[oppressed]] by the [[egyptians]], in order that they should be disposed to [[follow]] him so as to be delivered out of bondage. it was necessary that romulus should not remain in alba, and that he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should become [[king]] of [[rome]] and founder of the fatherland. it was necessary that cyrus should find the persians discontented with the [[government]] of the medes, and the medes soft and effeminate through their long [[peace]]. theseus could not have shown his ability had he not found the athenians dispersed. these opportunities, therefore, made those [[men]] fortunate, and their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity whereby their [[country]] was ennobled and made famous.
those who by valorous ways become princes [[prince]], like these [[men]], acquire a principality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease. the difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules [[rule]] and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their [[government]] and its security. and it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its [[success]], than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemies [[enemy]] all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. this coolness arises partly from [[fear]] of the opponents, who have the laws [[law]] on their side, and partly from the incredulity of [[men]], who do not readily [[believe]] in new things until they have had a long [[experience]] of them. thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such [[wise]] that the [[prince]] is endangered along with them.
it is necessary, therefore, if we [[desire]] to discuss this matter thoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves or have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate their enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use [[force]]? in the first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass anything; but when they can rely on themselves and use [[force]], then they are rarely endangered. hence it is that all armed prophets [[prophet]] have conquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed. besides the reasons [[reason]] mentioned, the [[nature]] of the [[people]] is variable, and whilst it is easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion. and thus it is necessary to take such measures that, when they [[believe]] no longer, it may be possible to make them [[believe]] by [[force]].
if [[moses]], cyrus, theseus, and romulus had been unarmed they could not have enforced their constitutions [[constitution]] for long—as happened in our [[time]] to fra girolamo savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things immediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no means of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the unbelievers to [[believe]]. therefore such as these have [[great]] difficulties in consummating their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the ascent, yet with ability they will overcome them; but when these are overcome, and those who envied them their [[success]] are exterminated, they will begin to be respected, and they will continue afterwards powerful, secure, honoured, and [[happy]].
to these [[great]] examples [[example]] i [[wish]] to add a lesser one; still it bears some resemblance to them, and i [[wish]] it to suffice me for all of a like [[kind]]: it is hiero the syracusan.[1] this [[man]] rose from a private station to be [[prince]] of syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything to [[fortune]] but opportunity; for the syracusans, being [[oppressed]], chose him for their captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made their [[prince]]. he was of so [[great]] ability, even as a private citizen, that one who writes of him says he wanted nothing but a [[kingdom]] to be a [[king]]. this [[man]] abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old alliances, made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on such foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had endured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping.

chapter vii.
concerning new principalities which are acquired either by the arms of others or by [[good]] fortune

those who solely by [[good]] [[fortune]] become princes [[prince]] from being private [[citizens]] have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they have not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they have many when they reach the summit. such are those to whom some [[state]] is given either for [[money]] or by the favour of him who bestows it; as happened to many in greece, in the cities [[city]] of ionia and of the hellespont, where princes [[prince]] were made by darius, in order that they might hold the cities [[city]] both for his security and his [[glory]]; as also were those emperors [[emperor]] who, by the [[corruption]] of the soldiers, from being [[citizens]] came to [[empire]]. such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the [[fortune]] of him who has elevated them—two most inconstant and unstable things. neither have they the [[knowledge]] requisite for the position; because, unless they are [[men]] of [[great]] worth and ability, it is not reasonable to expect that they should [[know]] how to command, having always lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it because they have not forces [[force]] which they can keep friendly and faithful.
states that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in [[nature]] which are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and correspondencies[1] fixed in such a way that the first storm will not overthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become princes [[prince]] are [[men]] of so much ability that they [[know]] they have to be prepared at once to hold that which [[fortune]] has thrown into their laps, and that those foundations, which others have laid before they became princes [[prince]], they must lay afterwards.
[1] “le radici e corrispondenze,” their roots (i.e. foundations) and correspondencies or relations with other states—a [[common]] meaning of “correspondence” and “correspondency” in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

concerning these two methods of rising to be a [[prince]] by ability or [[fortune]], i [[wish]] to adduce two examples [[example]] within our own recollection, and these are francesco sforza[2] and cesare borgia. francesco, by proper means and with [[great]] ability, from being a private [[person]] rose to be duke of milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties he kept with little trouble. on the other hand, cesare borgia, called by the [[people]] duke valentino, acquired his [[state]] during the ascendancy of his [[father]], and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he had taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a [[wise]] and able [[man]] to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and fortunes [[fortune]] of others had bestowed on him.
[2] francesco sforza, born 1401, died 1466. he [[married]] bianca maria visconti, a [[natural]] [[daughter]] of filippo visconti, the duke of milan, on whose [[death]] he procured his own elevation to the duchy. machiavelli was the accredited agent of the florentine [[republic]] to cesare borgia (1478-1507) during the transactions which [[led]] up to the assassinations of the orsini and vitelli at sinigalia, and along with his letters to his chiefs [[chief]] in florence he has left an account, written ten years before the [[prince]], of the proceedings of the duke in his “descritione del modo tenuto dal duca valentino nello ammazzare vitellozzo vitelli,” etc., a translation of which is appended to the [[present]] [[work]].

because, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations may be able with [[great]] ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. if, therefore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be seen that he laid solid foundations for his future [[power]], and i do not consider it superfluous to discuss them, because i do not [[know]] what [[better]] precepts to give a new [[prince]] than the [[example]] of his actions; and if his dispositions were of no avail, that was not his [[fault]], but the extraordinary and extreme malignity of [[fortune]].
alexander the sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his [[son]], had many immediate and prospective difficulties. firstly, he did not see his way to make him master of any [[state]] that was not a [[state]] of the [[church]]; and if he was willing to rob the [[church]] he knew that the duke of milan and the venetians would not [[consent]], because faenza and rimini were already under the protection of the venetians. besides this, he saw the arms of [[italy]], especially those by which he might have been assisted, in hands that would [[fear]] the aggrandizement of the [[pope]], namely, the orsini and the colonnesi and their following. it behoved him, therefore, to upset this [[state]] of affairs and embroil the powers [[power]], so as to make himself securely master of part of their states. this was easy for him to do, because he found the venetians, moved by other reasons [[reason]], inclined to bring back the french into [[italy]]; he would not only not oppose this, but he would render it more easy by dissolving the former [[marriage]] of [[king]] louis. therefore the [[king]] came into [[italy]] with the assistance of the venetians and the [[consent]] of alexander. he was no sooner in milan than the [[pope]] had soldiers from him for the attempt on the romagna, which yielded to him on the [[reputation]] of the [[king]]. the duke, therefore, having acquired the romagna and beaten the colonnesi, while wishing to hold that and to advance further, was hindered by two things: the one, his forces [[force]] did not appear [[loyal]] to him, the other, the goodwill of [[france]]: that is to say, he feared that the forces [[force]] of the orsini, which he was using, would not stand to him, that not only might they hinder him from winning more, but might themselves seize what he had won, and that the [[king]] might also do the same. of the orsini he had a warning when, after taking faenza and attacking bologna, he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack. and as to the [[king]], he learned his [[mind]] when he himself, after taking the duchy of urbino, attacked tuscany, and the [[king]] made him desist from that undertaking; hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the arms and the [[luck]] of others.
for the first thing he weakened the orsini and colonnesi parties in [[rome]], by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen, making them his gentlemen, giving them [[good]] [[pay]], and, according to their rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirely to the duke. after this he awaited an opportunity to crush the orsini, having scattered the adherents of the colonna house. this came to him soon and he used it well; for the orsini, perceiving at length that the aggrandizement of the duke and the [[church]] was ruin to them, called a meeting of the magione in perugia. from this sprung the rebellion at urbino and the tumults in the romagna, with endless dangers to the duke, all of which he overcame with the [[help]] of the french. having restored his [[authority]], not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the french or other outside forces [[force]], he had recourse to his wiles, and he knew so well how to conceal his [[mind]] that, by the mediation of signor pagolo—whom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds [[kind]] of attention, giving him [[money]], apparel, and horses—the orsini were reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his [[power]] at sinigalia.[3] having exterminated the leaders, and turned their partisans into his [[friends]], the duke laid sufficiently [[good]] foundations to his [[power]], having all the romagna and the duchy of urbino; and the [[people]] now beginning to appreciate their [[prosperity]], he gained them all over to himself. and as this point is worthy of notice, and to be imitated by others, i am not willing to leave it out.
[3] sinigalia, 31st december 1502.

when the duke occupied the romagna he found it under the [[rule]] of [[weak]] masters, who rather plundered their subjects [[subject]] than ruled them, and gave them more cause for disunion than for union, so that the [[country]] was full of robbery, quarrels, and every [[kind]] of [[violence]]; and so, wishing to bring back [[peace]] and [[obedience]] to [[authority]], he considered it necessary to give it a [[good]] governor. thereupon he promoted messer ramiro d’orco,[4] a swift and cruel [[man]], to whom he gave the fullest [[power]]. this [[man]] in a short [[time]] restored [[peace]] and unity with the [[greatest]] [[success]]. afterwards the duke considered that it was not advisable to confer such excessive [[authority]], for he had no [[doubt]] but that he would become odious, so he set up a court of [[judgment]] in the [[country]], under a most excellent president, wherein all cities [[city]] had their advocates. and because he knew that the [[past]] severity had caused some [[hatred]] against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds [[mind]] of the [[people]], and gain them entirely to himself, he [[desired]] to show that, if any [[cruelty]] had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in the [[natural]] sternness of the minister. under this pretence he took ramiro, and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the piazza at cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side. the barbarity of this spectacle caused the [[people]] to be at once satisfied and dismayed.
[4] ramiro d’orco. ramiro de lorqua.

but let us return whence we started. i say that the duke, finding himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate dangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a [[great]] measure crushed those forces [[force]] in his vicinity that could injure him if he wished to proceed with his [[conquest]], had next to consider [[france]], for he knew that the [[king]], who too late was aware of his mistake, would not support him. and from this [[time]] he began to seek new alliances and to temporize with [[france]] in the expedition which she was making towards the [[kingdom]] of naples against the spaniards who were besieging gaeta. it was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would have quickly accomplished had alexander lived.
such was his line of action as to [[present]] affairs. but as to the future he had to [[fear]], in the first place, that a new successor to the [[church]] might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. firstly, by exterminating the families [[family]] of those lords [[lord]] whom he had despoiled, so as to take away that pretext from the [[pope]]. secondly, by winning to himself all the gentlemen of [[rome]], so as to be able to curb the [[pope]] with their aid, as has been observed. thirdly, by converting the college more to himself. fourthly, by acquiring so much [[power]] before the [[pope]] should [[die]] that he could by his own measures resist the first shock. of these four things, at the [[death]] of alexander, he had accomplished three. for he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords [[lord]] as he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he had won over the roman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party in the college. and as to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become master of tuscany, for he already possessed perugia and piombino, and pisa was under his protection. and as he had no longer to study [[france]] (for the french were already driven out of the [[kingdom]] of naples by the spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill), he pounced down upon pisa. after this, lucca and siena yielded at once, partly through [[hatred]] and partly through [[fear]] of the florentines; and the florentines would have had no remedy had he continued to [[prosper]], as he was prospering the year that alexander died, for he had acquired so much [[power]] and [[reputation]] that he would have stood by himself, and no longer have depended on the [[luck]] and the forces [[force]] of others, but solely on his own [[power]] and ability.
but alexander died five years after he had first drawn the [[sword]]. he left the duke with the [[state]] of romagna alone consolidated, with the rest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies [[army]], and sick unto [[death]]. yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and he knew so well how [[men]] are to be won or lost, and so firm were the foundations which in so short a [[time]] he had laid, that if he had not had those armies [[army]] on his back, or if he had been in [[good]] health, he would have overcome all difficulties. and it is seen that his foundations were [[good]], for the romagna awaited him for more than a month. in [[rome]], although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst the baglioni, the vitelli, and the orsini might come to [[rome]], they could not effect anything against him. if he could not have made [[pope]] him whom he wished, at least the one whom he did not [[wish]] would not have been elected. but if he had been in sound health at the [[death]] of alexander,[5] everything would have been different to him. on the day that julius the second[6] was elected, he told me that he had [[thought]] of everything that might occur at the [[death]] of his [[father]], and had provided a remedy for all, except that he had never anticipated that, when the [[death]] did happen, he himself would be on the point to [[die]].
[5] alexander vi died of fever, 18th august 1503.

[6] julius ii was giuliano della rovere, cardinal of san pietro ad vincula, born 1443, died 1513.

when all the actions of the duke are recalled, i do not [[know]] how to blame him, but rather it appears to be, as i have said, that i ought to offer him for imitation to all those who, by the [[fortune]] or the arms of others, are raised to [[government]]. because he, having a lofty spirit and far-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise, and only the shortness of the [[life]] of alexander and his own sickness frustrated his designs. therefore, he who considers it necessary to secure himself in his new principality, to [[win]] [[friends]], to overcome either by [[force]] or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the [[people]], to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate those who have [[power]] or [[reason]] to hurt him, to [[change]] the old order of things for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to [[destroy]] a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain [[friendship]] with kings [[king]] and princes [[prince]] in such a way that they must [[help]] him with zeal and offend with caution, cannot find a more lively [[example]] than the actions of this [[man]].
only can he be blamed for the election of julius the second, in whom he made a [[bad]] [[choice]], because, as is said, not being able to elect a [[pope]] to his own [[mind]], he could have hindered any other from being elected [[pope]]; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to [[fear]] him if they became pontiffs. for [[men]] injure either from [[fear]] or [[hatred]]. those whom he had injured, amongst others, were san pietro ad vincula, colonna, san giorgio, and ascanio.[7] the rest, in becoming [[pope]], had to [[fear]] him, rouen and the spaniards excepted; the latter from their relationship and obligations, the former from his influence, the [[kingdom]] of [[france]] having relations with him. therefore, above everything, the duke ought to have created a spaniard [[pope]], and, failing him, he ought to have consented to rouen and not san pietro ad vincula. he who believes [[belief]] that new benefits will cause [[great]] personages to forget old injuries is deceived. therefore, the duke erred in his [[choice]], and it was the cause of his ultimate ruin.
[7] san giorgio is raffaello riario. ascanio is ascanio sforza.

chapter viii.
concerning those who have obtained a principality by wickedness

although a [[prince]] may rise from a private station in two ways, neither of which can be entirely attributed to [[fortune]] or genius, yet it is manifest to me that i must not be silent on them, although one could be more copiously treated when i discuss republics [[republic]]. these methods are when, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the principality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private [[person]] becomes the [[prince]] of his [[country]]. and speaking of the first method, it will be illustrated by two examples—one ancient, the other modern—and without entering further into the [[subject]], i consider these two examples [[example]] will suffice those who may be compelled to [[follow]] them.
agathocles, the sicilian,[1] became [[king]] of syracuse not only from a private but from a low and abject position. this [[man]], the [[son]] of a potter, through all the changes [[change]] in his fortunes [[fortune]] always [[led]] an infamous [[life]]. nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of [[mind]] and [[body]] that, having devoted himself to the [[military]] profession, he rose through its ranks to be praetor of syracuse. being established in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself [[prince]] and to seize by [[violence]], without obligation to others, that which had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding for this [[purpose]] with amilcar, the carthaginian, who, with his [[army]], was fighting in sicily. one morning he assembled the [[people]] and the senate of syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the [[republic]], and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the [[people]]; these [[dead]], he seized and held the princedom of that [[city]] without any civil commotion. and although he was twice routed by the carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not only was he able to defend his [[city]], but leaving part of his [[men]] for its defence, with the others he attacked [[africa]], and in a short [[time]] raised the siege of syracuse. the carthaginians, reduced to extreme necessity, were compelled to come to terms with agathocles, and, leaving sicily to him, had to be content with the possession of [[africa]].
[1] agathocles the sicilian, born 361 b.c., died 289 b.c.

therefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this [[man]] will see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to [[fortune]], inasmuch as he attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any one, but step by step in the [[military]] profession, which steps were gained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly held by him with many hazardous dangers. yet it cannot be called talent to slay fellow-citizens, to [[deceive]] [[friends]], to be without [[faith]], without [[mercy]], without [[religion]]; such methods may gain [[empire]], but not [[glory]]. still, if the [[courage]] of agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his greatness of [[mind]] in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain. nevertheless, his barbarous [[cruelty]] and inhumanity with infinite wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent [[men]]. what he achieved cannot be attributed either to [[fortune]] or genius.
in our times [[time]], during the [[rule]] of alexander the sixth, oliverotto da fermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up by his maternal uncle, giovanni fogliani, and in the early days of his [[youth]] sent to [[fight]] under pagolo vitelli, that, being trained under his discipline, he might attain some high position in the [[military]] profession. after pagolo died, he fought under his [[brother]] vitellozzo, and in a very short [[time]], being endowed with wit and a vigorous [[body]] and [[mind]], he became the first [[man]] in his profession. but it appearing a paltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some [[citizens]] of fermo, to whom the [[slavery]] of their [[country]] was dearer than its [[liberty]], and with the [[help]] of the vitelleschi, to seize fermo. so he wrote to giovanni fogliani that, having been away from [[home]] for many years, he wished to visit him and his [[city]], and in some measure to look upon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire anything except [[honour]], yet, in order that the [[citizens]] should see he had not spent his [[time]] in [[vain]], he [[desired]] to come honourably, so would be accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his [[friends]] and retainers; and he entreated giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by the fermians, all of which would be not only to his [[honour]], but also to that of giovanni himself, who had brought him up.
giovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew, and he caused him to be honourably received by the fermians, and he lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invited giovanni fogliani and the chiefs [[chief]] of fermo. when the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual in such banquets were finished, oliverotto artfully began [[certain]] grave discourses, speaking of the greatness of [[pope]] alexander and his [[son]] cesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse giovanni and others answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a chamber, whither giovanni and the rest of the [[citizens]] went in after him. no sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places and slaughtered giovanni and the rest. after these murders oliverotto, mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the [[chief]] magistrate in the palace, so that in [[fear]] the [[people]] were forced to obey him, and to form a [[government]], of which he made himself the [[prince]]. he killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and strengthened himself with new civil and [[military]] ordinances, in such a way that, in the year during which he held the principality, not only was he secure in the [[city]] of fermo, but he had become formidable to all his neighbours. and his destruction would have been as difficult as that of agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by cesare borgia, who took him with the orsini and vitelli at sinigalia, as was stated above. thus one year after he had committed this parricide, he was strangled, together with vitellozzo, whom he had made his leader in valour and wickedness.
some may wonder how it can happen that agathocles, and his like, after infinite treacheries and cruelties, should [[live]] for long secure in his [[country]], and defend himself from external enemies [[enemy]], and never be conspired against by his own [[citizens]]; seeing that many others, by means of [[cruelty]], have never been able even in peaceful times [[time]] to hold the [[state]], still less in the doubtful times [[time]] of [[war]]. i [[believe]] that this follows from severities[2] being badly or properly used. those may be called properly used, if of [[evil]] it is possible to speak well, that are applied at one blow and are necessary to one’s security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects [[subject]]. the badly employed are those which, notwithstanding they may be few in the commencement, multiply with [[time]] rather than decrease. those who practise the first [[system]] are able, by aid of [[god]] or [[man]], to mitigate in some [[degree]] their [[rule]], as agathocles did. it is impossible for those who [[follow]] the other to maintain themselves.
[2] mr burd suggests that this word probably comes near the [[modern]] equivalent of machiavelli’s [[thought]] when he speaks of “crudelta” than the more obvious “cruelties.”

hence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a [[state]], the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling [[men]] he will be able to reassure them, and [[win]] them to himself by benefits. he who does otherwise, either from timidity or [[evil]] [[advice]], is always compelled to keep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects [[subject]], nor can they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs [[wrong]]. for injuries ought to be done all at one [[time]], so that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that the flavour of them may [[last]] longer.
and above all things, a [[prince]] ought to [[live]] amongst his [[people]] in such a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of [[good]] or [[evil]], shall make him [[change]]; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled times [[time]], you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not [[help]] you, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be under any obligation to you for them.
chapter ix.
concerning a civil principality

but coming to the other point—where a leading citizen becomes the [[prince]] of his [[country]], not by wickedness or any intolerable [[violence]], but by the favour of his fellow citizens—this may be called a civil principality: nor is genius or [[fortune]] altogether necessary to attain to it, but rather a [[happy]] shrewdness. i say then that such a principality is obtained either by the favour of the [[people]] or by the favour of the nobles [[noble]]. because in all cities [[city]] these two distinct parties are found, and from this it arises that the [[people]] do not [[wish]] to be ruled nor [[oppressed]] by the nobles [[noble]], and the nobles [[noble]] [[wish]] to [[rule]] and [[oppress]] the [[people]]; and from these two opposite desires [[desire]] there arises in cities [[city]] one of three results, either a principality, self-government, or [[anarchy]].
a principality is created either by the [[people]] or by the nobles [[noble]], accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the nobles [[noble]], seeing they cannot withstand the [[people]], begin to cry up the [[reputation]] of one of themselves, and they make him a [[prince]], so that under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. the [[people]], finding they cannot resist the nobles [[noble]], also cry up the [[reputation]] of one of themselves, and make him a [[prince]] so as to be defended by his [[authority]]. he who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles [[noble]] maintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid of the [[people]], because the former finds himself with many around him who consider themselves his equals [[equal]], and because of this he can neither [[rule]] nor manage them to his liking. but he who reaches sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, and has none around him, or few, who are not prepared to obey him.
besides this, one cannot by [[fair]] dealing, and without injury to others, satisfy the nobles [[noble]], but you can satisfy the [[people]], for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles [[noble]], the latter wishing to [[oppress]], while the former only [[desire]] not to be [[oppressed]]. it is to be added also that a [[prince]] can never secure himself against a hostile [[people]], because of there being too many, whilst from the nobles [[noble]] he can secure himself, as they are few in number. the worst that a [[prince]] may expect from a hostile [[people]] is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile nobles [[noble]] he has not only to [[fear]] abandonment, but also that they will rise against him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and astute, always come forward in [[time]] to save themselves, and to obtain favours from him whom they expect to prevail. further, the [[prince]] is compelled to [[live]] always with the same [[people]], but he can do well without the same nobles [[noble]], being able to make and unmake them daily, and to give or take away [[authority]] when it pleases him.
therefore, to make this point clearer, i say that the nobles [[noble]] ought to be looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your [[fortune]], or they do not. those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought to be honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt with in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a [[natural]] want of [[courage]], in which case you ought to make use of them, especially of those who are of [[good]] counsel; and thus, whilst in [[prosperity]] you [[honour]] them, in adversity you do not have to [[fear]] them. but when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it is a token that they are giving more [[thought]] to themselves than to you, and a [[prince]] ought to guard against such, and to [[fear]] them as if they were open enemies [[enemy]], because in adversity they always [[help]] to ruin him.
therefore, one who becomes a [[prince]] through the favour of the [[people]] ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only ask not to be [[oppressed]] by him. but one who, in opposition to the [[people]], becomes a [[prince]] by the favour of the nobles [[noble]], ought, above everything, to seek to [[win]] the [[people]] over to himself, and this he may easily do if he takes them under his protection. because [[men]], when they receive [[good]] from him of whom they were expecting [[evil]], are bound more closely to their benefactor; thus the [[people]] quickly become more devoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their favours; and the [[prince]] can [[win]] their affections in many ways, but as these vary according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules [[rule]], so i omit them; but, i repeat, it is necessary for a [[prince]] to have the [[people]] friendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity.
nabis,[1] [[prince]] of the spartans, sustained the attack of all greece, and of a victorious roman [[army]], and against them he defended his [[country]] and his [[government]]; and for the overcoming of this peril it was only necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this would not have been sufficient had the [[people]] been hostile. and do not let any one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that “he who builds on the [[people]], builds on the mud,” for this is true when a private citizen makes a foundation there, and persuades himself that the [[people]] will [[free]] him when he is [[oppressed]] by his enemies [[enemy]] or by the magistrates; wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as happened to the gracchi in [[rome]] and to messer giorgio scali[2] in florence. but granted a [[prince]] who has established himself as above, who can command, and is a [[man]] of [[courage]], undismayed in adversity, who does not fail in other qualifications, and who, by his resolution and energy, keeps the whole [[people]] encouraged—such a one will never find himself deceived in them, and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well.

these principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from the civil to the absolute order of [[government]], for such princes [[prince]] either [[rule]] personally or through magistrates. in the latter case their [[government]] is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on the goodwill of those [[citizens]] who are raised to the magistracy, and who, especially in troubled times [[time]], can [[destroy]] the [[government]] with [[great]] ease, either by intrigue or open defiance; and the [[prince]] has not the [[chance]] amid tumults to exercise absolute [[authority]], because the [[citizens]] and subjects [[subject]], accustomed to receive orders from magistrates, are not of a [[mind]] to obey him amid these confusions, and there will always be in doubtful times [[time]] a scarcity of [[men]] whom he can trust. for such a [[prince]] cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times [[time]], when [[citizens]] have need of the [[state]], because then every one agrees with him; they all promise, and when [[death]] is far distant they all [[wish]] to [[die]] for him; but in troubled times [[time]], when the [[state]] has need of its [[citizens]], then he finds but few. and so much the more is this experiment dangerous, inasmuch as it can only be tried once. therefore a [[wise]] [[prince]] ought to adopt such a course that his [[citizens]] will always in every sort and [[kind]] of circumstance have need of the [[state]] and of him, and then he will always find them faithful.
chapter x.
concerning the way in which the [[strength]] of all principalities ought to be measured

it is necessary to consider another point in examining the [[character]] of these principalities: that is, whether a [[prince]] has such [[power]] that, in case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether he has always need of the assistance of others. and to make this quite clear i say that i consider those who are able to support themselves by their own resources who can, either by abundance of [[men]] or [[money]], raise a sufficient [[army]] to join [[battle]] against any one who comes to attack them; and i consider those always to have need of others who cannot show themselves against the [[enemy]] in the field, but are forced to defend themselves by sheltering behind walls. the first case has been discussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. in the second case one can say nothing except to encourage such princes [[prince]] to provision and fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the [[country]]. and whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the other concerns of his subjects [[subject]] in the way stated above, and to be often repeated, will never be attacked without [[great]] caution, for [[men]] are always adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town well fortified, and is not hated by his [[people]].
the cities [[city]] of germany are absolutely [[free]], they own but little [[country]] around them, and they yield [[obedience]] to the [[emperor]] when it suits them, nor do they [[fear]] this or any other [[power]] they may have near them, because they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks [[think]] the taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they have proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they always keep in [[public]] depots enough for one year’s eating, drinking, and firing. and beyond this, to keep the [[people]] quiet and without loss to the [[state]], they always have the means of giving [[work]] to the [[community]] in those labours [[labour]] that are the [[life]] and [[strength]] of the [[city]], and on the pursuit of which the [[people]] are supported; they also hold [[military]] exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them.
therefore, a [[prince]] who has a [[strong]] [[city]], and had not made himself odious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only be driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this [[world]] are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an [[army]] a whole year in the field without being interfered with. and whoever should reply: if the [[people]] have [[property]] outside the [[city]], and see it burnt, they will not remain patient, and the long siege and self-interest will make them forget their [[prince]]; to this i [[answer]] that a powerful and courageous [[prince]] will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one [[time]] [[hope]] to his subjects [[subject]] that the [[evil]] will not be for long, at another [[time]] [[fear]] of the [[cruelty]] of the [[enemy]], then preserving himself adroitly from those subjects [[subject]] who seem to him to be too bold.
further, the [[enemy]] would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin the [[country]] at the [[time]] when the spirits of the [[people]] are still hot and ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the [[prince]] to hesitate; because after a [[time]], when spirits have cooled, the damage is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer any remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with their [[prince]], he appearing to be under obligations to them now that their houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his defence. for it is the [[nature]] of [[men]] to be bound by the benefits they confer as much as by those they receive. therefore, if everything is well considered, it will not be difficult for a [[wise]] [[prince]] to keep the minds [[mind]] of his [[citizens]] steadfast from first to [[last]], when he does not fail to support and defend them.
chapter xi.
concerning ecclesiastical principalities

it only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching which all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they are acquired either by capacity or [[good]] [[fortune]], and they can be held without either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of [[religion]], which are so all-powerful, and of such a [[character]] that the principalities may be held no matter how their princes [[prince]] behave and [[live]]. these princes [[prince]] alone have states and do not defend them; and they have subjects [[subject]] and do not [[rule]] them; and the states, although unguarded, are not taken from them, and the subjects [[subject]], although not ruled, do not [[care]], and they have neither the [[desire]] nor the ability to alienate themselves. such principalities only are secure and [[happy]]. but being upheld by powers [[power]], to which the [[human]] [[mind]] cannot reach, i shall speak no more of them, because, being exalted and maintained by [[god]], it would be the act of a presumptuous and rash [[man]] to discuss them.
nevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the [[church]] has attained such greatness in temporal [[power]], seeing that from alexander backwards the italian potentates (not only those who have been called potentates, but every baron and [[lord]], though the smallest) have valued the temporal [[power]] very slightly—yet now a [[king]] of [[france]] trembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from [[italy]], and to ruin the venetians—although this may be very manifest, it does not appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.
before charles, [[king]] of [[france]], passed into [[italy]],[1] this [[country]] was under the dominion of the [[pope]], the venetians, the [[king]] of naples, the duke of milan, and the florentines. these potentates had two principal anxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter [[italy]] under arms; the other, that none of themselves should seize more territory. those about whom there was the most [[anxiety]] were the [[pope]] and the venetians. to restrain the venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as it was for the defence of ferrara; and to keep down the [[pope]] they made use of the barons of [[rome]], who, being divided into two factions, orsini and colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with arms in their hands under the [[eyes]] of the pontiff, kept the pontificate [[weak]] and powerless. and although there might arise sometimes a courageous [[pope]], such as sixtus, yet neither [[fortune]] nor [[wisdom]] could rid him of these annoyances. and the short [[life]] of a [[pope]] is also a cause of weakness; for in the ten years, which is the average [[life]] of a [[pope]], he can with difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one [[people]] should almost [[destroy]] the colonnesi, another would arise hostile to the orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet would not have [[time]] to ruin the orsini. this was the [[reason]] why the temporal powers [[power]] of the [[pope]] were little esteemed in [[italy]].
[1] charles viii invaded [[italy]] in 1494.

alexander the sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that have ever been showed how a [[pope]] with both [[money]] and arms was able to prevail; and through the instrumentality of the duke valentino, and by [[reason]] of the entry of the french, he brought about all those things which i have discussed above in the actions of the duke. and although his intention was not to aggrandize the [[church]], but the duke, nevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the [[church]], which, after his [[death]] and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all his labours [[labour]].
pope julius came afterwards and found the [[church]] [[strong]], possessing all the romagna, the barons of [[rome]] reduced to impotence, and, through the chastisements of alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found the way open to accumulate [[money]] in a manner such as had never been practised before alexander’s [[time]]. such things julius not only followed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain bologna, to ruin the venetians, and to drive the french out of [[italy]]. all of these enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit, inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the [[church]] and not any private [[person]]. he kept also the orsini and colonnesi factions within the bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them some [[mind]] to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm: the one, the greatness of the [[church]], with which he terrified them; and the other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused the disorders among them. for whenever these factions have their cardinals they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster the factions in [[rome]] and out of it, and the barons are compelled to support them, and thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders and tumults among the barons. for these reasons [[reason]] his holiness [[pope]] leo[2] found the pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that, if others made it [[great]] in arms, he will make it still greater and more venerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues [[virtue]].
[2] [[pope]] leo x was the cardinal de’ medici.

chapter xii.
how many kinds [[kind]] of soldiery there are, and concerning mercenaries

having discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such principalities as in the beginning i proposed to discuss, and having considered in some [[degree]] the causes of there being [[good]] or [[bad]], and having shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and to hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of offence and defence which belong to each of them.
we have seen above how necessary it is for a [[prince]] to have his foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to ruin. the [[chief]] foundations of all states, new as well as old or composite, are [[good]] laws [[law]] and [[good]] arms; and as there cannot be [[good]] laws [[law]] where the [[state]] is not well armed, it follows that where they are well armed they have [[good]] laws [[law]]. i shall leave the laws [[law]] out of the discussion and shall speak of the arms.
i say, therefore, that the arms with which a [[prince]] defends his [[state]] are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed. mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his [[state]] based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful, valiant before [[friends]], cowardly before enemies [[enemy]]; they have neither the [[fear]] of [[god]] nor fidelity to [[men]], and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is; for in [[peace]] one is robbed by them, and in [[war]] by the [[enemy]]. the [[fact]] is, they have no other attraction or [[reason]] for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing to [[die]] for you. they are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make [[war]], but if [[war]] comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which i should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of [[italy]] has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes [[hope]] for many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were. thus it was that charles, [[king]] of [[france]], was allowed to seize [[italy]] with chalk in hand;[1] and he who told us that our sins [[sin]] were the cause of it told the [[truth]], but they were not the sins [[sin]] he imagined, but those which i have related. and as they were the sins [[sin]] of princes [[prince]], it is the princes [[prince]] who have also [[suffered]] the penalty.
[1] “with chalk in hand,” “col gesso.” this is one of the bons mots of alexander vi, and refers to the ease with which charles viii seized [[italy]], implying that it was only necessary for him to send his quartermasters to chalk up the billets for his soldiers to conquer the [[country]]. cf. “the [[history]] of henry vii,” by [[lord]] bacon: “king charles had conquered the realm of naples, and lost it again, in a [[kind]] of a felicity of a [[dream]]. he passed the whole length of [[italy]] without [[resistance]]: so that it was true what [[pope]] alexander was wont to say: that the frenchmen came into [[italy]] with chalk in their hands, to mark up their lodgings, rather than with swords [[sword]] to [[fight]].”

i [[wish]] to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. the mercenary captains are either capable [[men]] or they are not; if they are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are ruined in the usual way.
and if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way, whether mercenary or not, i reply that when arms have to be resorted to, either by a [[prince]] or a [[republic]], then the [[prince]] ought to go in [[person]] and perform the [[duty]] of a captain; the [[republic]] has to send its [[citizens]], and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws [[law]] so that he does not leave the command. and [[experience]] has shown princes [[prince]] and republics [[republic]], single-handed, making the [[greatest]] [[progress]], and mercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to bring a [[republic]], armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its [[citizens]] than it is to bring one armed with [[foreign]] arms. [[rome]] and sparta stood for many ages [[age]] armed and [[free]]. the switzers are completely armed and quite [[free]].
of ancient mercenaries, for [[example]], there are the carthaginians, who were [[oppressed]] by their mercenary soldiers after the first [[war]] with the romans, although the carthaginians had their own [[citizens]] for captains. after the [[death]] of epaminondas, philip of macedon was made captain of their soldiers by the thebans, and after [[victory]] he took away their [[liberty]].
duke filippo being [[dead]], the milanese enlisted francesco sforza against the venetians, and he, having overcome the [[enemy]] at caravaggio,[2] allied himself with them to crush the milanese, his masters. his [[father]], sforza, having been engaged by queen johanna[3] of naples, left her unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms of the [[king]] of aragon, in order to save her [[kingdom]]. and if the venetians and florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms, and yet their captains did not make themselves princes [[prince]], but have defended them, i reply that the florentines in this case have been favoured by [[chance]], for of the able captains, of whom they might have stood in [[fear]], some have not conquered, some have been opposed, and others have turned their ambitions elsewhere. one who did not conquer was giovanni acuto,[4] and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved; but every one will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the florentines would have stood at his discretion. sforza had the bracceschi always against him, so they watched each other. francesco turned his [[ambition]] to lombardy; braccio against the [[church]] and the [[kingdom]] of naples. but let us come to that which happened a short while ago. the florentines appointed as their captain pagolo vitelli, a most prudent [[man]], who from a private position had risen to the [[greatest]] renown. if this [[man]] had taken pisa, nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the florentines to keep in with him, for if he became the soldier of their enemies [[enemy]] they had no means of resisting, and if they held to him they must obey him. the venetians, if their achievements are considered, will be seen to have acted safely and gloriously so long as they sent to [[war]] their own [[men]], when with armed gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. this was before they turned to enterprises on [[land]], but when they began to [[fight]] on [[land]] they forsook this [[virtue]] and followed the custom of [[italy]]. and in the beginning of their expansion on [[land]], through not having much territory, and because of their [[great]] [[reputation]], they had not much to [[fear]] from their captains; but when they expanded, as under carmignuola,[5] they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him a most valiant [[man]] (they beat the duke of milan under his leadership), and, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the [[war]], they feared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this [[reason]] they were not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to lose again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order to secure themselves, to murder him. they had afterwards for their captains bartolomeo da bergamo, roberto da san severino, the count of pitigliano,[6] and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not gain, as happened afterwards at vaila,[7] where in one [[battle]] they lost that which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much trouble. because from such arms conquests come but slowly, long delayed and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.

[7] [[battle]] of vaila in 1509.

and as with these examples [[example]] i have reached [[italy]], which has been ruled for many years by mercenaries, i [[wish]] to discuss them more seriously, in order that, having seen their rise and [[progress]], one may be [[better]] prepared to counteract them. you must [[understand]] that the [[empire]] has recently come to be repudiated in [[italy]], that the [[pope]] has acquired more temporal [[power]], and that [[italy]] has been divided up into more states, for the [[reason]] that many of the [[great]] cities [[city]] took up arms against their nobles [[noble]], who, formerly favoured by the [[emperor]], were oppressing them, whilst the [[church]] was favouring them so as to gain [[authority]] in temporal [[power]]: in many others their [[citizens]] became princes [[prince]]. from this it came to pass that [[italy]] fell partly into the hands of the [[church]] and of republics [[republic]], and, the [[church]] consisting of priests [[priest]] and the [[republic]] of [[citizens]] unaccustomed to arms, both commenced to enlist foreigners.
the first who gave renown to this soldiery was alberigo da conio,[8] the romagnian. from the school of this [[man]] sprang, among others, braccio and sforza, who in their [[time]] were the arbiters of [[italy]]. after these came all the other captains who till now have directed the arms of [[italy]]; and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been overrun by charles, robbed by louis, ravaged by ferdinand, and insulted by the switzers. the [[principle]] that has guided them has been, first, to lower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own. they did this because, subsisting on their [[pay]] and without territory, they were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not give them any [[authority]]; so they were [[led]] to employ cavalry, with a moderate [[force]] of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs were brought to such a pass that, in an [[army]] of twenty thousand soldiers, there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. they had, besides this, used every art [[arts]] to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners [[prisoner]] and liberating without ransom. they did not attack towns at night, nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night; they did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did they campaign in the winter. all these things were permitted by their [[military]] rules [[rule]], and devised by them to avoid, as i have said, both fatigue and dangers; thus they have brought [[italy]] to [[slavery]] and contempt.

chapter xiii.
concerning auxiliaries, mixed soldiery, and one’s own

auxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a [[prince]] is called in with his forces [[force]] to aid and defend, as was done by [[pope]] julius in the most recent times [[time]]; for he, having, in the enterprise against ferrara, had [[poor]] proof of his mercenaries, turned to auxiliaries, and stipulated with ferdinand, [[king]] of [[spain]],[1] for his assistance with [[men]] and arms. these arms may be useful and [[good]] in themselves, but for him who calls them in they are always disadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their captive.
[1] ferdinand v (f. ii of aragon and sicily, f. iii of naples), surnamed “the catholic,” born 1452, died 1516.

and although ancient histories [[history]] may be full of examples [[example]], i do not [[wish]] to leave this recent one of [[pope]] julius the second, the peril of which cannot fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get ferrara, threw himself entirely into the hands of the foreigner. but his [[good]] [[fortune]] brought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his rash [[choice]]; because, having his auxiliaries routed at ravenna, and the switzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all expectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did not become [[prisoner]] to his enemies [[enemy]], they having fled, nor to his auxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs.
the florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand frenchmen to take pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other [[time]] of their troubles.
the [[emperor]] of constantinople,[2] to oppose his neighbours, sent ten thousand turks into greece, who, on the [[war]] being finished, were not willing to quit; this was the beginning of the servitude of greece to the infidels.
[2] joannes cantacuzenus, born 1300, died 1383.

therefore, let him who has no [[desire]] to conquer make use of these arms, for they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with them the ruin is ready made; they are all [[united]], all yield [[obedience]] to others; but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more [[time]] and [[better]] opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one [[community]], they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you have made their head, is not able all at once to assume enough [[authority]] to injure you. in conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most dangerous; in auxiliaries, valour. the [[wise]] [[prince]], therefore, has always avoided these arms and turned to his own; and has been willing rather to lose with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming that a real [[victory]] which is gained with the arms of others.
i shall never hesitate to cite cesare borgia and his actions. this duke entered the romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only french soldiers, and with them he captured imola and forli; but afterwards, such forces [[force]] not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries, discerning less danger in them, and enlisted the orsini and vitelli; whom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and dangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own [[men]]. and the difference between one and the other of these forces [[force]] can easily be seen when one considers the difference there was in the [[reputation]] of the duke, when he had the french, when he had the orsini and vitelli, and when he relied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and found it ever increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when every one saw that he was complete master of his own forces [[force]].
i was not intending to go beyond italian and recent examples [[example]], but i am unwilling to leave out hiero, the syracusan, he being one of those i have named above. this [[man]], as i have said, made head of the [[army]] by the syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted like our italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him that he could neither keep them not let them go, he had them all cut to pieces, and afterwards made [[war]] with his own forces [[force]] and not with aliens.
i [[wish]] also to recall to memory an instance from the old testament applicable to this [[subject]]. [[david]] offered himself to saul to [[fight]] with goliath, the philistine champion, and, to give him [[courage]], saul armed him with his own [[weapons]]; which [[david]] rejected as soon as he had them on his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to meet the [[enemy]] with his sling and his knife. in conclusion, the arms of others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind you fast.
charles the seventh,[3] the [[father]] of [[king]] louis the eleventh,[4] having by [[good]] [[fortune]] and valour liberated [[france]] from the english, recognized the necessity of being armed with forces [[force]] of his own, and he established in his [[kingdom]] ordinances concerning men-at-arms and infantry. afterwards his [[son]], [[king]] louis, abolished the infantry and began to enlist the switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as is now seen, a source of peril to that [[kingdom]]; because, having raised the [[reputation]] of the switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of his own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his men-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so accustomed to [[fight]] along with switzers, it does not appear that they can now conquer without them. hence it arises that the french cannot stand against the switzers, and without the switzers they do not come off well against others. the armies [[army]] of the french have thus become mixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms together are much [[better]] than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone, but much inferior to one’s own forces [[force]]. and this [[example]] proves it, for the [[kingdom]] of [[france]] would be unconquerable if the ordinance of charles had been enlarged or maintained.
[3] charles vii of [[france]], surnamed “the victorious,” born 1403, died 1461.

[4] louis xi, [[son]] of the above, born 1423, died 1483.

but the scanty [[wisdom]] of [[man]], on entering into an affair which looks well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as i have said above of hectic fevers. therefore, if he who rules [[rule]] a principality cannot recognize evils [[evil]] until they are upon him, he is not truly [[wise]]; and this insight is given to few. and if the first disaster to the roman empire[5] should be examined, it will be found to have commenced only with the enlisting of the goths; because from that [[time]] the vigour of the roman [[empire]] began to decline, and all that valour which had raised it passed away to others.
[5] “many speakers to the house the other night in the debate on the reduction of armaments seemed to show a most lamentable ignorance of the conditions under which the british [[empire]] maintains its existence. when mr balfour replied to the allegations that the roman [[empire]] sank under the weight of its [[military]] obligations, he said that this was ‘wholly unhistorical.’ he might well have added that the roman [[power]] was at its zenith when every citizen acknowledged his liability to [[fight]] for the [[state]], but that it began to decline as soon as this obligation was no longer recognised.”—pall mall gazette, 15th may 1906.

i conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having its own forces [[force]]; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on [[good]] [[fortune]], not having the valour which in adversity would defend it. and it has always been the [[opinion]] and [[judgment]] of [[wise]] [[men]] that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or [[power]] not founded on its own [[strength]]. and one’s own forces [[force]] are those which are composed either of subjects [[subject]], [[citizens]], or dependents; all others are mercenaries or auxiliaries. and the way to make ready one’s own forces [[force]] will be easily found if the rules [[rule]] suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one will consider how philip, the [[father]] of alexander the [[great]], and many republics [[republic]] and princes [[prince]] have armed and organized themselves, to which rules [[rule]] i entirely commit myself.
chapter xiv.
that which concerns a [[prince]] on the [[subject]] of the art [[arts]] of war

a [[prince]] ought to have no other aim or [[thought]], nor select anything else for his study, than [[war]] and its rules [[rule]] and discipline; for this is the sole art [[arts]] that belongs to him who rules [[rule]], and it is of such [[force]] that it not only upholds those who are born princes [[prince]], but it often enables [[men]] to rise from a private station to that rank. and, on the contrary, it is seen that when princes [[prince]] have [[thought]] more of ease than of arms they have lost their states. and the first cause of your losing it is to neglect this art [[arts]]; and what enables you to acquire a [[state]] is to be master of the art [[arts]]. francesco sforza, through being martial, from a private [[person]] became duke of milan; and the sons [[son]], through avoiding the hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons [[person]]. for among other evils [[evil]] which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a [[prince]] ought to guard himself, as is shown later on. because there is nothing proportionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not reasonable that he who is armed should yield [[obedience]] willingly to him who is unarmed, or that the unarmed [[man]] should be secure among armed servants. because, there being in the one disdain and in the other suspicion, it is not possible for them to [[work]] well together. and therefore a [[prince]] who does not [[understand]] the art [[arts]] of [[war]], over and above the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them. he ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts [[thought]] this [[subject]] of [[war]], and in [[peace]] he should addict himself more to its exercise than in [[war]]; this he can do in two ways, the one by action, the other by study.
as regards action, he ought above all things to keep his [[men]] well organized and drilled, to [[follow]] incessantly the chase, by which he accustoms his [[body]] to hardships, and learns something of the [[nature]] of localities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valleys open out, how the plains [[lie]], and to [[understand]] the [[nature]] of rivers and marshes, and in all this to take the [[greatest]] [[care]]. which [[knowledge]] is useful in two ways. firstly, he learns to [[know]] his [[country]], and is [[better]] able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by means of the [[knowledge]] and observation of that locality, he understands with ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter; because the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and marshes that are, for instance, in tuscany, have a [[certain]] resemblance to those of other countries [[country]], so that with a [[knowledge]] of the aspect of one [[country]] one can easily arrive at a [[knowledge]] of others. and the [[prince]] that lacks this [[skill]] lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should possess, for it teaches [[teach]] him to surprise his [[enemy]], to select quarters, to lead armies [[army]], to array the [[battle]], to besiege towns to advantage.
philopoemen,[1] [[prince]] of the achaeans, among other praises [[praise]] which writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in [[time]] of [[peace]] he never had anything in his [[mind]] but the rules [[rule]] of [[war]]; and when he was in the [[country]] with [[friends]], he often stopped and reasoned with them: “if the [[enemy]] should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here with our [[army]], with whom would be the advantage? how should one [[best]] advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? if we should [[wish]] to retreat, how ought we to pursue?” and he would set forth to them, as he went, all the chances [[chance]] that could befall an [[army]]; he would listen to their [[opinion]] and [[state]] his, confirming it with reasons [[reason]], so that by these continual discussions there could never arise, in [[time]] of [[war]], any unexpected circumstances that he could not deal with.
[1] philopoemen, “the [[last]] of the greeks [[greek]],” born 252 b.c., died 183 b.c.

but to exercise the [[intellect]] the [[prince]] should [[read]] histories [[history]], and study there the actions of illustrious [[men]], to see how they have borne themselves in [[war]], to examine the causes of their victories [[victory]] and defeat, so as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as an illustrious [[man]] did, who took as an exemplar one who had been praised and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he always kept in his [[mind]], as it is said alexander the [[great]] imitated achilles, caesar alexander, scipio cyrus. and whoever reads the [[life]] of cyrus, written by xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the [[life]] of scipio how that imitation was his [[glory]], and how in chastity, affability, [[humanity]], and liberality scipio conformed to those things which have been written of cyrus by xenophon. a [[wise]] [[prince]] ought to observe some such rules [[rule]], and never in peaceful times [[time]] stand idle, but increase his resources with industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity, so that if [[fortune]] chances [[chance]] it may find him prepared to resist her blows.
chapter xv.
concerning things for which [[men]], and especially princes [[prince]], are praised or blamed

it remains now to see what ought to be the rules [[rule]] of conduct for a [[prince]] towards [[subject]] and [[friends]]. and as i [[know]] that many have written on this point, i expect i shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning it again, especially as in discussing it i shall depart from the methods of other [[people]]. but, it being my intention to write a thing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me more appropriate to [[follow]] up the real [[truth]] of the matter than the [[imagination]] of it; for many have pictured republics [[republic]] and principalities which in [[fact]] have never been known or seen, because how one lives [[life]] is so far distant from how one ought to [[live]], that he who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a [[man]] who wishes [[wish]] to act entirely up to his professions of [[virtue]] soon meets with what destroys him among so much that is [[evil]].
hence it is necessary for a [[prince]] wishing to hold his own to [[know]] how to do [[wrong]], and to make use of it or not according to necessity. therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a [[prince]], and discussing those which are real, i say that all [[men]] when they are spoken of, and chiefly princes [[prince]] for being more highly placed, are remarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or [[praise]]; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using a tuscan term (because an avaricious [[person]] in our [[language]] is still he who desires [[desire]] to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed generous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; one affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous; one [[religious]], another unbelieving, and the like. and i [[know]] that every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a [[prince]] to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered [[good]]; but because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for [[human]] conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently prudent that he may [[know]] how to avoid the reproach of those vices [[vice]] which would lose him his [[state]]; and also to keep himself, if it be possible, from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he may with less hesitation abandon himself to them. and again, he need not make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices [[vice]] without which the [[state]] can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like [[virtue]], if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which looks like [[vice]], yet followed brings him security and [[prosperity]].
chapter xvi.
concerning liberality and meanness

commencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, i say that it would be well to be reputed liberal. nevertheless, liberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the [[reputation]] for it, injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the reproach of its opposite. therefore, any one wishing to maintain among [[men]] the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence; so that a [[prince]] thus inclined will consume in such acts all his [[property]], and will be compelled in the end, if he [[wish]] to maintain the name of liberal, to unduly weigh down his [[people]], and tax them, and do everything he can to get [[money]]. this will soon make him odious to his subjects [[subject]], and becoming [[poor]] he will be little valued by any one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly.
therefore, a [[prince]], not being able to exercise this [[virtue]] of liberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if he is [[wise]] he ought not to [[fear]] the [[reputation]] of being mean, for in [[time]] he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that with his economy his revenues [[revenue]] are enough, that he can defend himself against all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without burdening his [[people]]; thus it comes to pass that he exercises liberality towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless, and meanness towards those to whom he does not give, who are few.
we have not seen [[great]] things done in our [[time]] except by those who have been considered mean; the rest have failed. [[pope]] julius the second was assisted in reaching the papacy by a [[reputation]] for liberality, yet he did not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made [[war]] on the [[king]] of [[france]]; and he made many wars [[war]] without imposing any extraordinary tax on his subjects [[subject]], for he supplied his additional expenses out of his long thriftiness. the [[present]] [[king]] of [[spain]] would not have undertaken or conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. a [[prince]], therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects [[subject]], that he can defend himself, that he does not become [[poor]] and abject, that he is not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account a [[reputation]] for being mean, for it is one of those vices [[vice]] which will enable him to govern.
and if any one should say: caesar obtained [[empire]] by liberality, and many others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal, and by being considered so, i [[answer]]: either you are a [[prince]] in [[fact]], or in a way to become one. in the first case this liberality is dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal; and caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in [[rome]]; but if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his expenses, he would have destroyed his [[government]]. and if any one should reply: many have been princes [[prince]], and have done [[great]] things with armies [[army]], who have been considered very liberal, i reply: either a [[prince]] spends that which is his own or his subjects’ or else that of others. in the first case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to neglect any opportunity for liberality. and to the [[prince]] who goes forth with his [[army]], supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion, handling that which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary, otherwise he would not be followed by soldiers. and of that which is neither yours nor your subjects’ you can be a ready giver, as were cyrus, caesar, and alexander; because it does not take away your [[reputation]] if you squander that of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own that injures you.
and there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst you exercise it you lose the [[power]] to do so, and so become either [[poor]] or despised, or else, in avoiding [[poverty]], rapacious and hated. and a [[prince]] should guard himself, above all things, against being despised and hated; and liberality leads you to both. therefore it is wiser to have a [[reputation]] for meanness which brings reproach without [[hatred]], than to be compelled through seeking a [[reputation]] for liberality to incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with [[hatred]].
chapter xvii.
concerning [[cruelty]] and clemency, and whether it is [[better]] to be loved than feared

coming now to the other qualities mentioned above, i say that every [[prince]] ought to [[desire]] to be considered clement and not cruel. nevertheless he ought to take [[care]] not to misuse this clemency. cesare borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his [[cruelty]] reconciled the romagna, unified it, and restored it to [[peace]] and loyalty. and if this be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more merciful than the florentine [[people]], who, to avoid a [[reputation]] for [[cruelty]], permitted pistoia to be destroyed.[1] therefore a [[prince]], so long as he keeps his subjects [[subject]] [[united]] and [[loyal]], ought not to [[mind]] the reproach of [[cruelty]]; because with a few examples [[example]] he will be more merciful than those who, through too much [[mercy]], allow disorders to arise, from which [[follow]] murders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole [[people]], whilst those executions which originate with a [[prince]] offend the [[individual]] only.
[1] during the rioting between the cancellieri and panciatichi factions in 1502 and 1503.

and of all princes [[prince]], it is impossible for the new [[prince]] to avoid the imputation of [[cruelty]], owing to new states being full of dangers. hence [[virgil]], through the mouth of dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign owing to its being new, saying:
“res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt
moliri, et late fines custode tueri.”[2]

nevertheless he ought to be slow to [[believe]] and to act, nor should he himself show [[fear]], but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and [[humanity]], so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and too much distrust render him intolerable.
[2] . . . against my will, my fate
a [[throne]] unsettled, and an infant [[state]],
bid me defend my realms with all my pow’rs,
and guard with these severities my shores.

christopher pitt.

upon this a [[question]] arises: whether it be [[better]] to be loved than feared or feared than loved? it may be answered that one should [[wish]] to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one [[person]], it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. because this is to be asserted in general of [[men]], that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their [[blood]], [[property]], [[life]], and [[children]], as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. and that [[prince]] who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships [[friendship]] that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of [[mind]], may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in [[time]] of need cannot be relied upon; and [[men]] have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for [[love]] is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of [[men]], is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but [[fear]] preserves you by a dread of [[punishment]] which never fails.
nevertheless a [[prince]] ought to inspire [[fear]] in such a way that, if he does not [[win]] [[love]], he avoids [[hatred]]; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the [[property]] of his [[citizens]] and subjects [[subject]] and from their [[women]]. but when it is necessary for him to proceed against the [[life]] of someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause, but above all things he must keep his hands off the [[property]] of others, because [[men]] more quickly forget the [[death]] of their [[father]] than the loss of their patrimony. besides, pretexts for taking away the [[property]] are never wanting; for he who has once begun to [[live]] by robbery will always find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons [[reason]] for taking [[life]], on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse. but when a [[prince]] is with his [[army]], and has under control a multitude of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the [[reputation]] of [[cruelty]], for without it he would never hold his [[army]] [[united]] or disposed to its duties [[duty]].
among the wonderful deeds of hannibal this one is enumerated: that having [[led]] an enormous [[army]], composed of many various races [[race]] of [[men]], to [[fight]] in [[foreign]] lands [[land]], no dissensions arose either among them or against the [[prince]], whether in his [[bad]] or in his [[good]] [[fortune]]. this arose from nothing else than his inhuman [[cruelty]], which, with his boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his soldiers, but without that [[cruelty]], his other virtues [[virtue]] were not sufficient to [[produce]] this effect. and short-sighted writers [[admire]] his deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal cause of them. that it is true his other virtues [[virtue]] would not have been sufficient for him may be proved by the case of scipio, that most excellent [[man]], not only of his own times [[time]] but within the memory of [[man]], against whom, nevertheless, his [[army]] rebelled in [[spain]]; this arose from nothing but his too [[great]] forbearance, which gave his soldiers more license than is consistent with [[military]] discipline. for this he was upbraided in the senate by fabius maximus, and called the corrupter of the roman soldiery. the locrians were laid waste by a legate of scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate punished, owing entirely to his easy [[nature]]. insomuch that someone in the senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many [[men]] who knew much [[better]] how not to err than to [[correct]] the errors of others. this disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have destroyed in [[time]] the fame and [[glory]] of scipio; but, he being under the control of the senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed itself, but contributed to his [[glory]].
returning to the [[question]] of being feared or loved, i come to the conclusion that, [[men]] loving according to their own will and fearing according to that of the [[prince]], a [[wise]] [[prince]] should establish himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must endeavour only to avoid [[hatred]], as is noted.
chapter xviii.[1]
concerning the way in which princes [[prince]] should keep faith

[1] “the [[present]] [[chapter]] has given greater offence than any other portion of machiavelli’s writings.” burd, “il principe,” p. 297.

every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a [[prince]] to keep [[faith]], and to [[live]] with integrity and not with craft. nevertheless our [[experience]] has been that those princes [[prince]] who have done [[great]] things have held [[good]] [[faith]] of little account, and have known how to circumvent the [[intellect]] of [[men]] by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on their word. you must [[know]] there are two ways of contesting,[2] the one by the [[law]], the other by [[force]]; the first method is proper to [[men]], the second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is necessary to have recourse to the second. therefore it is necessary for a [[prince]] to [[understand]] how to avail himself of the beast and the [[man]]. this has been figuratively taught to princes [[prince]] by ancient writers, who describe how achilles and many other princes [[prince]] of old were given to the centaur chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half [[man]], so it is necessary for a [[prince]] to [[know]] how to make use of both natures [[nature]], and that one without the other is not durable. a [[prince]], therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves. therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves. those who rely simply on the lion do not [[understand]] what they are about. therefore a [[wise]] [[lord]] cannot, nor ought he to, keep [[faith]] when such observance may be turned against him, and when the reasons [[reason]] that caused him to pledge it [[exist]] no longer. if [[men]] were entirely [[good]] this precept would not hold, but because they are [[bad]], and will not keep [[faith]] with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them. nor will there ever be wanting to a [[prince]] legitimate reasons [[reason]] to excuse this non-observance. of this endless [[modern]] examples [[example]] could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made void and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes [[prince]]; and he who has known [[best]] how to employ the fox has succeeded [[best]].
[2] “contesting,” i.e. “striving for mastery.” mr burd points out that this passage is imitated directly from cicero’s “de officiis”: “nam cum sint duo genera decertandi, unum per disceptationem, alterum per vim; cumque illud proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum est ad posterius, si uti non licet superiore.”

but it is necessary to [[know]] well how to [[disguise]] this characteristic, and to be a [[great]] pretender and dissembler; and [[men]] are so simple, and so [[subject]] to [[present]] necessities, that he who seeks to [[deceive]] will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. one recent [[example]] i cannot pass over in [[silence]]. alexander the sixth did nothing else but [[deceive]] [[men]], nor ever [[thought]] of doing otherwise, and he always found victims; for there never was a [[man]] who had greater [[power]] in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to his wishes [[wish]],[3] because he well understood this side of [[mankind]].
[3] “nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad votum).” the words “ad votum” are omitted in the testina addition, 1550.

alexander never did what he said,
cesare never said what he did.

italian proverb.

therefore it is unnecessary for a [[prince]] to have all the [[good]] qualities i have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. and i shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, [[religious]], upright, and to be so, but with a [[mind]] so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and [[know]] how to [[change]] to the opposite.
and you have to [[understand]] this, that a [[prince]], especially a new one, cannot observe all those things for which [[men]] are esteemed, being often forced, in order to maintain the [[state]], to act contrary to fidelity,[4] [[friendship]], [[humanity]], and [[religion]]. therefore it is necessary for him to have a [[mind]] ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and variations of [[fortune]] [[force]] it, yet, as i have said above, not to diverge from the [[good]] if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then to [[know]] how to set about it.
[4] “contrary to fidelity” or “faith,” “contro alla fede,” and “tutto fede,” “altogether faithful,” in the next paragraph. it is noteworthy that these two phrases, “contro alla fede” and “tutto fede,” were omitted in the testina edition, which was published with the sanction of the papal authorities [[authority]]. it may be that the meaning attached to the word “fede” was “the [[faith]],” i.e. the catholic creed, and not as rendered here “fidelity” and “faithful.” observe that the word “religione” was [[suffered]] to stand in the text of the testina, being used to signify indifferently every shade of [[belief]], as witness “the [[religion]],” a phrase inevitably employed to designate the huguenot heresy. south in his sermon ix, p. 69, ed. 1843, comments on this passage as follows: “that [[great]] patron and coryphaeus of this tribe, nicolo machiavel, laid down this for a master [[rule]] in his [[political]] scheme: ‘that the show of [[religion]] was helpful to the politician, but the reality of it hurtful and pernicious.’”

for this [[reason]] a [[prince]] ought to take [[care]] that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and [[religious]]. there is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this [[last]] quality, inasmuch as [[men]] [[judge]] generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. every one sees what you appear to be, few really [[know]] what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the [[opinion]] of the many, who have the majesty of the [[state]] to defend them; and in the actions of all [[men]], and especially of princes [[prince]], which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges [[judge]] by the result.
for that [[reason]], let a [[prince]] have the credit of conquering and holding his [[state]], the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the [[world]] there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on.
one prince[5] of the [[present]] [[time]], whom it is not well to name, never preaches anything else but [[peace]] and [[good]] [[faith]], and to both he is most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of [[reputation]] and [[kingdom]] many a [[time]].
[5] ferdinand of aragon. “when machiavelli was writing the [[prince]] it would have been clearly impossible to mention ferdinand’s name here without giving offence.” burd’s “il principe,” p. 308.

chapter xix.
that one should avoid being despised and hated

now, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, i have spoken of the more important ones, the others i [[wish]] to discuss briefly under this generality, that the [[prince]] must consider, as has been in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him hated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he will have fulfilled his part, and he need not [[fear]] any danger in other reproaches.
it makes him hated above all things, as i have said, to be rapacious, and to be a violator of the [[property]] and [[women]] of his subjects [[subject]], from both of which he must abstain. and when neither their [[property]] nor their [[honor]] is touched, the majority of [[men]] [[live]] content, and he has only to contend with the [[ambition]] of a few, whom he can curb with ease in many ways.
it makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a [[prince]] should guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his actions greatness, [[courage]], gravity, and fortitude; and in his private dealings with his subjects [[subject]] let him show that his judgments [[judgment]] are irrevocable, and maintain himself in such [[reputation]] that no one can [[hope]] either to [[deceive]] him or to get round him.
that [[prince]] is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself, and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for, provided it is well known that he is an excellent [[man]] and revered by his [[people]], he can only be attacked with difficulty. for this [[reason]] a [[prince]] ought to have two fears [[fear]], one from within, on account of his subjects [[subject]], the other from without, on account of external powers [[power]]. from the latter he is defended by being well armed and having [[good]] allies, and if he is well armed he will have [[good]] [[friends]], and affairs will always remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they should have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should affairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and has lived as i have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resist every attack, as i said nabis the spartan did.
but concerning his subjects [[subject]], when affairs outside are disturbed he has only to [[fear]] that they will conspire secretly, from which a [[prince]] can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by keeping the [[people]] satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for him to accomplish, as i said above at length. and one of the most efficacious remedies that a [[prince]] can have against conspiracies is not to be hated and despised by the [[people]], for he who conspires against a [[prince]] always expects to please them by his removal; but when the conspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have the [[courage]] to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront a conspirator are infinite. and as [[experience]] shows, many have been the conspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires cannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he believes [[belief]] to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your [[mind]] to a malcontent you have given him the material with which to content himself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that, seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the other to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or a thoroughly obstinate [[enemy]] of the [[prince]], to keep [[faith]] with you.
and, to reduce the matter into a small compass, i say that, on the side of the conspirator, there is nothing but [[fear]], [[jealousy]], prospect of [[punishment]] to terrify him; but on the side of the [[prince]] there is the majesty of the principality, the laws [[law]], the protection of [[friends]] and the [[state]] to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the popular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to conspire. for whereas in general the conspirator has to [[fear]] before the execution of his plot, in this case he has also to [[fear]] the sequel to the crime; because on account of it he has the [[people]] for an [[enemy]], and thus cannot [[hope]] for any escape.
endless examples [[example]] could be given on this [[subject]], but i will be content with one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers [[father]]. messer annibale bentivogli, who was [[prince]] in bologna (grandfather of the [[present]] annibale), having been murdered by the canneschi, who had conspired against him, not one of his [[family]] survived but messer giovanni,[1] who was in [[childhood]]: immediately after his assassination the [[people]] rose and murdered all the canneschi. this sprung from the popular goodwill which the house of bentivogli enjoyed in those days in bologna; which was so [[great]] that, although none remained there after the [[death]] of annibale who was able to [[rule]] the [[state]], the bolognese, having information that there was one of the bentivogli [[family]] in florence, who up to that [[time]] had been considered the [[son]] of a blacksmith, sent to florence for him and gave him the [[government]] of their [[city]], and it was ruled by him until messer giovanni came in due course to the [[government]].
[1] giovanni bentivogli, born in bologna 1438, died at milan 1508. he ruled bologna from 1462 to 1506. machiavelli’s [[strong]] condemnation of conspiracies may get its edge from his own very recent [[experience]] (february 1513), when he had been arrested and tortured for his alleged complicity in the boscoli conspiracy.

for this [[reason]] i consider that a [[prince]] ought to reckon conspiracies of little account when his [[people]] hold him in esteem; but when it is hostile to him, and bears [[hatred]] towards him, he ought to [[fear]] everything and everybody. and well-ordered states and [[wise]] princes [[prince]] have taken every [[care]] not to drive the nobles [[noble]] to desperation, and to keep the [[people]] satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important objects a [[prince]] can have.
among the [[best]] ordered and governed kingdoms [[kingdom]] of our times [[time]] is [[france]], and in it are found many [[good]] [[institutions]] on which depend the [[liberty]] and security of the [[king]]; of these the first is the [[parliament]] and its [[authority]], because he who founded the [[kingdom]], knowing the [[ambition]] of the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the [[hatred]] of the [[people]], founded in [[fear]], against the nobles [[noble]], he wished to [[protect]] them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular [[care]] of the [[king]]; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be liable to from the nobles [[noble]] for favouring the [[people]], and from the [[people]] for favouring the nobles [[noble]], he set up an arbiter, who should be one who could beat down the [[great]] and favour the lesser without reproach to the [[king]]. neither could you have a [[better]] or a more prudent arrangement, or a greater source of security to the [[king]] and [[kingdom]]. from this one can draw another important conclusion, that princes [[prince]] ought to leave affairs of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in their own hands. and further, i consider that a [[prince]] ought to cherish the nobles [[noble]], but not so as to make himself hated by the [[people]].
it may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives [[life]] and deaths [[death]] of the roman emperors [[emperor]] that many of them would be an [[example]] contrary to my [[opinion]], seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed [[great]] qualities of [[soul]], nevertheless they have lost their [[empire]] or have been killed by subjects [[subject]] who have conspired against them. wishing, therefore, to [[answer]] these objections, i will recall the characters [[character]] of some of the emperors [[emperor]], and will show that the causes of their ruin were not different to those alleged by me; at the same [[time]] i will only submit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the affairs of those times [[time]].
it seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors [[emperor]] who succeeded to the [[empire]] from marcus the philosopher down to maximinus; they were marcus and his [[son]] commodus, pertinax, julian, severus and his [[son]] antoninus caracalla, macrinus, heliogabalus, alexander, and maximinus.
there is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the [[ambition]] of the nobles [[noble]] and the insolence of the [[people]] only have to be contended with, the roman emperors [[emperor]] had a third difficulty in having to put up with the [[cruelty]] and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so beset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and [[people]]; because the [[people]] loved [[peace]], and for this [[reason]] they loved the unaspiring [[prince]], whilst the soldiers loved the warlike [[prince]] who was bold, cruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise upon the [[people]], so that they could get double [[pay]] and give vent to their own greed and [[cruelty]]. hence it arose that those emperors [[emperor]] were always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no [[great]] [[authority]], and most of them, especially those who came new to the principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours [[humour]], were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about injuring the [[people]]. which course was necessary, because, as princes [[prince]] cannot [[help]] being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the [[hatred]] of the most powerful. therefore, those emperors [[emperor]] who through inexperience had need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the [[people]]; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not, accordingly as the [[prince]] knew how to maintain [[authority]] over them.
from these causes it arose that marcus, pertinax, and alexander, being all [[men]] of modest [[life]], lovers of [[justice]], enemies [[enemy]] to [[cruelty]], humane, and benignant, came to a [[sad]] end except marcus; he alone lived and died honoured, because he had succeeded to the [[throne]] by hereditary title, and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the [[people]]; and afterwards, being possessed of many virtues [[virtue]] which made him respected, he always kept both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated nor despised.
but pertinax was created [[emperor]] against the wishes [[wish]] of the soldiers, who, being accustomed to [[live]] licentiously under commodus, could not endure the honest [[life]] to which pertinax wished to reduce them; thus, having given cause for [[hatred]], to which [[hatred]] there was added contempt for his old [[age]], he was overthrown at the very beginning of his administration. and here it should be noted that [[hatred]] is acquired as much by [[good]] works [[work]] as by [[bad]] ones, therefore, as i said before, a [[prince]] wishing to keep his [[state]] is very often forced to do [[evil]]; for when that [[body]] is [[corrupt]] whom you [[think]] you have need of to maintain yourself—it may be either the [[people]] or the soldiers or the nobles—you have to submit to its humours [[humour]] and to gratify them, and then [[good]] works [[work]] will do you harm.
but let us come to alexander, who was a [[man]] of such [[great]] goodness, that among the other praises [[praise]] which are accorded him is this, that in the fourteen years he held the [[empire]] no one was ever put to [[death]] by him unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a [[man]] who allowed himself to be governed by his [[mother]], he became despised, the [[army]] conspired against him, and murdered him.
turning now to the opposite characters [[character]] of commodus, severus, antoninus caracalla, and maximinus, you will find them all cruel and rapacious-men who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to commit every [[kind]] of [[iniquity]] against the [[people]]; and all, except severus, came to a [[bad]] end; but in severus there was so much valour that, keeping the soldiers friendly, although the [[people]] were [[oppressed]] by him, he reigned successfully; for his valour made him so much admired in the sight of the soldiers and [[people]] that the latter were kept in a way astonished and awed and the former respectful and satisfied. and because the actions of this [[man]], as a new [[prince]], were [[great]], i [[wish]] to show briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, which natures [[nature]], as i said above, it is necessary for a [[prince]] to imitate.
knowing the sloth of the [[emperor]] julian, he persuaded the [[army]] in sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be [[right]] to go to [[rome]] and avenge the [[death]] of pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the [[throne]], he moved the [[army]] on [[rome]], and reached [[italy]] before it was known that he had started. on his arrival at [[rome]], the senate, through [[fear]], elected him [[emperor]] and killed julian. after this there remained for severus, who wished to make himself master of the whole [[empire]], two difficulties; one in [[asia]], where niger, head of the asiatic [[army]], had caused himself to be proclaimed [[emperor]]; the other in the west where albinus was, who also aspired to the [[throne]]. and as he considered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided to attack niger and to [[deceive]] albinus. to the latter he wrote that, being elected [[emperor]] by the senate, he was willing to share that [[dignity]] with him and sent him the title of caesar; and, moreover, that the senate had made albinus his colleague; which things were accepted by albinus as true. but after severus had conquered and killed niger, and settled oriental affairs, he returned to [[rome]] and complained to the senate that albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had by treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was compelled to punish him. afterwards he sought him out in [[france]], and took from him his [[government]] and [[life]]. he who will, therefore, carefully examine the actions of this [[man]] will find him a most valiant lion and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one, and not hated by the [[army]]; and it need not be wondered at that he, a new [[man]], was able to hold the [[empire]] so well, because his supreme renown always protected him from that [[hatred]] which the [[people]] might have conceived against him for his [[violence]].
but his [[son]] antoninus was a most eminent [[man]], and had very excellent qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the [[people]] and acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike [[man]], most enduring of fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which caused him to be beloved by the armies [[army]]. nevertheless, his ferocity and cruelties were so [[great]] and so unheard of that, after endless [[single]] murders, he killed a large number of the [[people]] of [[rome]] and all those of alexandria. he became hated by the whole [[world]], and also feared by those he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst of his [[army]] by a centurion. and here it must be noted that such-like deaths [[death]], which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate [[courage]], cannot be avoided by princes [[prince]], because any one who does not [[fear]] to [[die]] can inflict them; but a [[prince]] may [[fear]] them the less because they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the [[state]]. antoninus had not taken this [[care]], but had contumeliously killed a [[brother]] of that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, and proved the emperor’s ruin.
but let us come to commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to hold the [[empire]], for, being the [[son]] of marcus, he had inherited it, and he had only to [[follow]] in the footsteps of his [[father]] to please his [[people]] and soldiers; but, being by [[nature]] cruel and brutal, he gave himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he might indulge his rapacity upon the [[people]]; on the other hand, not maintaining his [[dignity]], often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the imperial majesty, he fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being hated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against and was killed.
it remains to discuss the [[character]] of maximinus. he was a very warlike [[man]], and the armies [[army]], being disgusted with the effeminacy of alexander, of whom i have already spoken, killed him and elected maximinus to the [[throne]]. this he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated and despised; the one, his having kept sheep in thrace, which brought him into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a [[great]] indignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession to his dominions deferred going to [[rome]] and taking possession of the imperial seat; he had also gained a [[reputation]] for the utmost ferocity by having, through his prefects in [[rome]] and elsewhere in the [[empire]], practised many cruelties, so that the whole [[world]] was moved to anger at the meanness of his birth and to [[fear]] at his barbarity. first [[africa]] rebelled, then the senate with all the [[people]] of [[rome]], and all [[italy]] conspired against him, to which may be added his own [[army]]; this latter, besieging aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were disgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so many against him, murdered him.
i do not [[wish]] to discuss heliogabalus, macrinus, or julian, who, being thoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but i will bring this discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes [[prince]] in our times [[time]] have this difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far less [[degree]], because, notwithstanding one has to give them some indulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes [[prince]] have armies [[army]] that are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were the armies [[army]] of the roman [[empire]]; and whereas it was then more necessary to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the [[people]], it is now more necessary to all princes [[prince]], except the turk and the soldan, to satisfy the [[people]] rather the soldiers, because the [[people]] are the more powerful.
from the above i have excepted the turk, who always keeps round him twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend the security and [[strength]] of the [[kingdom]], and it is necessary that, putting aside every consideration for the [[people]], he should keep them his [[friends]]. the [[kingdom]] of the soldan is similar; being entirely in the hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the [[people]], he must keep them his [[friends]]. but you must note that the [[state]] of the soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the [[reason]] that it is like the [[christian]] pontificate, which cannot be called either an hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons [[son]] of the old [[prince]] are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by those who have [[authority]], and the sons [[son]] remain only noblemen. and this being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality, because there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in new ones; for although the [[prince]] is new, the [[constitution]] of the [[state]] is old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditary [[lord]].
but returning to the [[subject]] of our discourse, i say that whoever will consider it will acknowledge that either [[hatred]] or contempt has been fatal to the above-named emperors [[emperor]], and it will be recognized also how it happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number in another, only one in each way came to a [[happy]] end and the rest to unhappy ones. because it would have been useless and dangerous for pertinax and alexander, being new princes [[prince]], to imitate marcus, who was heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly destructive to caracalla, commodus, and maximinus to have imitated severus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread in his footsteps. therefore a [[prince]], new to the principality, cannot imitate the actions of marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to [[follow]] those of severus, but he ought to take from severus those parts which are necessary to found his [[state]], and from marcus those which are proper and glorious to keep a [[state]] that may already be stable and firm.
chapter xx.
are fortresses, and many other things to which princes [[prince]] often resort, advantageous or hurtful?

1. some princes [[prince]], so as to hold securely the [[state]], have disarmed their subjects [[subject]]; others have kept their [[subject]] towns distracted by factions; others have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning of their governments [[government]]; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown and destroyed them. and although one cannot give a final [[judgment]] on all of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those states in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless i will speak as comprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.
2. there never was a new [[prince]] who has disarmed his subjects [[subject]]; rather when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by arming them, those arms become yours, those [[men]] who were distrusted become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your subjects [[subject]] become your adherents. and whereas all subjects [[subject]] cannot be armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they quite [[understand]], makes the former your dependents, and the latter, considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and service should have the most [[reward]], excuse you. but when you disarm them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions [[opinion]] breeds [[hatred]] against you. and because you cannot remain unarmed, it follows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the [[character]] already shown; even if they should be [[good]] they would not be sufficient to defend you against powerful enemies [[enemy]] and distrusted subjects [[subject]]. therefore, as i have said, a new [[prince]] in a new principality has always distributed arms. histories [[history]] are full of examples [[example]]. but when a [[prince]] acquires a new [[state]], which he adds as a province to his old one, then it is necessary to disarm the [[men]] of that [[state]], except those who have been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with [[time]] and opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters should be managed in such a way that all the armed [[men]] in the [[state]] shall be your own soldiers who in your old [[state]] were living near you.
3. our forefathers, and those who were reckoned [[wise]], were accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold pistoia by factions and pisa by fortresses; and with this [[idea]] they fostered quarrels in some of their tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily. this may have been well enough in those times [[time]] when [[italy]] was in a way balanced, but i do not [[believe]] that it can be accepted as a precept for to-day, because i do not [[believe]] that factions can ever be of use; rather it is [[certain]] that when the [[enemy]] comes upon you in divided cities [[city]] you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always assist the outside forces [[force]] and the other will not be able to resist. the venetians, moved, as i [[believe]], by the above reasons [[reason]], fostered the guelph and ghibelline factions in their tributary cities [[city]]; and although they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these disputes amongst them, so that the [[citizens]], distracted by their differences, should not unite against them. which, as we saw, did not afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at vaila, one party at once took [[courage]] and seized the [[state]]. such methods argue, therefore, weakness in the [[prince]], because these factions will never be permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the more easily to manage subjects [[subject]] are only useful in times [[time]] of [[peace]], but if [[war]] comes this policy proves fallacious.
4. without [[doubt]] princes [[prince]] become [[great]] when they overcome the difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore [[fortune]], especially when she desires [[desire]] to make a new [[prince]] [[great]], who has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes enemies [[enemy]] to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a ladder which his enemies [[enemy]] have raised. for this [[reason]] many consider that a [[wise]] [[prince]], when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown may rise higher.
5. princes [[prince]], especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistance in those [[men]] who in the beginning of their [[rule]] were distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted. pandolfo petrucci, [[prince]] of siena, ruled his [[state]] more by those who had been distrusted than by others. but on this [[question]] one cannot speak generally, for it varies so much with the [[individual]]; i will only say this, that those [[men]] who at the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are of a description to need assistance to support themselves, can always be gained over with the [[greatest]] ease, and they will be tightly held to serve the [[prince]] with fidelity, inasmuch as they [[know]] it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the [[bad]] impression which he had formed of them; and thus the [[prince]] always extracts more [[profit]] from them than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect his affairs. and since the matter demands it, i must not fail to warn a [[prince]], who by means of secret favours has acquired a new [[state]], that he must well consider the reasons [[reason]] which induced those to favour him who did so; and if it be not a [[natural]] affection towards him, but only discontent with their [[government]], then he will only keep them friendly with [[great]] trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfy them. and weighing well the reasons [[reason]] for this in those examples [[example]] which can be taken from ancient and [[modern]] affairs, we shall find that it is easier for the [[prince]] to make [[friends]] of those [[men]] who were contented under the former [[government]], and are therefore his enemies [[enemy]], than of those who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it.
6. it has been a custom with princes [[prince]], in order to hold their states more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit to those who might design to [[work]] against them, and as a place of refuge from a first attack. i [[praise]] this [[system]] because it has been made use of formerly. notwithstanding that, messer nicolo vitelli in our times [[time]] has been seen to demolish two fortresses in citta di castello so that he might keep that [[state]]; guido ubaldo, duke of urbino, on returning to his dominion, whence he had been driven by cesare borgia, razed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the bentivogli returning to bologna came to a similar decision. fortresses, therefore, are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you [[good]] in one way they injure you in another. and this [[question]] can be reasoned thus: the [[prince]] who has more to [[fear]] from the [[people]] than from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to [[fear]] from foreigners than from the [[people]] ought to leave them alone. the castle of milan, built by francesco sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the house of sforza than any other disorder in the [[state]]. for this [[reason]] the [[best]] possible fortress is—not to be hated by the [[people]], because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the [[people]] hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist a [[people]] who have taken arms against you. it has not been seen in our times [[time]] that such fortresses have been of use to any [[prince]], unless to the countess of forli,[1] when the count girolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from milan, and thus recover her [[state]]; and the posture of affairs was such at that [[time]] that the foreigners could not assist the [[people]]. but fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when cesare borgia attacked her, and when the [[people]], her [[enemy]], were allied with foreigners. therefore, it would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have been hated by the [[people]] than to have had the fortresses. all these things considered then, i shall [[praise]] him who builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and i shall blame whoever, trusting in them, cares [[care]] little about being hated by the [[people]].
[1] catherine sforza, a [[daughter]] of galeazzo sforza and lucrezia landriani, born 1463, died 1509. it was to the countess of forli that machiavelli was sent as envoy on 1499. a letter from fortunati to the countess announces the appointment: “i have been with the signori,” wrote fortunati, “to learn whom they would send and when. they tell me that nicolo machiavelli, a learned [[young]] florentine [[noble]], secretary to my lords [[lord]] of the ten, is to leave with me at once.” cf. “catherine sforza,” by count pasolini, translated by p. sylvester, 1898.

chapter xxi.
how a [[prince]] should conduct himself so as to gain renown

nothing makes a [[prince]] so much esteemed as [[great]] enterprises and setting a fine [[example]]. we have in our [[time]] ferdinand of aragon, the [[present]] [[king]] of [[spain]]. he can almost be called a new [[prince]], because he has risen, by fame and [[glory]], from being an insignificant [[king]] to be the foremost [[king]] in christendom; and if you will consider his deeds you will find them all [[great]] and some of them extraordinary. in the beginning of his reign he attacked granada, and this enterprise was the foundation of his dominions. he did this quietly at first and without any [[fear]] of hindrance, for he held the minds [[mind]] of the barons of castile occupied in thinking of the [[war]] and not anticipating any innovations; thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring [[power]] and [[authority]] over them. he was able with the [[money]] of the [[church]] and of the [[people]] to sustain his armies [[army]], and by that long [[war]] to lay the foundation for the [[military]] [[skill]] which has since distinguished him. further, always using [[religion]] as a plea, so as to undertake greater schemes, he devoted himself with pious [[cruelty]] to driving out and clearing his [[kingdom]] of the moors; nor could there be a more admirable [[example]], nor one more rare. under this same cloak he assailed [[africa]], he came down on [[italy]], he has finally attacked [[france]]; and thus his achievements and designs have always been [[great]], and have kept the minds [[mind]] of his [[people]] in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of them. and his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other, that [[men]] have never been given [[time]] to [[work]] steadily against him.
again, it much assists a [[prince]] to set unusual examples [[example]] in internal affairs, similar to those which are related of messer bernabo da milano, who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil [[life]] doing some extraordinary thing, either [[good]] or [[bad]], would take some method of rewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about. and a [[prince]] ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gain for himself the [[reputation]] of being a [[great]] and remarkable [[man]].
a [[prince]] is also respected when he is either a true friend or a downright [[enemy]], that is to say, when, without any reservation, he declares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course will always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two of your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a [[character]] that, if one of them conquers, you have either to [[fear]] him or not. in either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare yourself and to make [[war]] strenuously; because, in the first case, if you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the conqueror, to the [[pleasure]] and satisfaction of him who has been conquered, and you will have no reasons [[reason]] to offer, nor anything to [[protect]] or to shelter you. because he who conquers does not want doubtful [[friends]] who will not aid him in the [[time]] of [[trial]]; and he who loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, [[sword]] in hand, court his [[fate]].
antiochus went into greece, being sent for by the ætolians to drive out the romans. he sent envoys to the achaeans, who were [[friends]] of the romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the romans urged them to take up arms. this [[question]] came to be discussed in the council of the achaeans, where the legate of antiochus urged them to stand neutral. to this the roman legate answered: “as for that which has been said, that it is [[better]] and more advantageous for your [[state]] not to interfere in our [[war]], nothing can be more erroneous; because by not interfering you will be left, without favour or consideration, the guerdon of the conqueror.” thus it will always happen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutrality, whilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with arms. and irresolute princes [[prince]], to avoid [[present]] dangers, generally [[follow]] the neutral path, and are generally ruined. but when a [[prince]] declares himself gallantly in favour of one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, although the victor may be powerful and may have him at his [[mercy]], yet he is indebted to him, and there is established a bond of amity; and [[men]] are never so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing you. victories [[victory]] after all are never so complete that the victor must not show some regard, especially to [[justice]]. but if he with whom you ally yourself loses, you may be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he may aid you, and you become companions on a [[fortune]] that may rise again.
in the second case, when those who [[fight]] are of such a [[character]] that you have no [[anxiety]] as to who may conquer, so much the more is it greater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction of one by the aid of another who, if he had been [[wise]], would have saved him; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with your assistance, he remains at your discretion. and here it is to be noted that a [[prince]] ought to take [[care]] never to make an [[alliance]] with one more powerful than himself for the purposes [[purpose]] of attacking others, unless necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers you are at his discretion, and princes [[prince]] ought to avoid as much as possible being at the discretion of any one. the venetians joined with [[france]] against the duke of milan, and this [[alliance]], which caused their ruin, could have been avoided. but when it cannot be avoided, as happened to the florentines when the [[pope]] and [[spain]] sent armies [[army]] to attack lombardy, then in such a case, for the above reasons [[reason]], the [[prince]] ought to favour one of the parties.
never let any [[government]] imagine that it can choose perfectly safe courses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones, because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid one trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish the [[character]] of troubles, and for [[choice]] to take the lesser [[evil]].
a [[prince]] ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to [[honour]] the proficient in every art [[arts]]. at the same [[time]] he should encourage his [[citizens]] to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and agriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not be deterred from improving his possessions for [[fear]] lest they be taken away from him or another from opening up [[trade]] for [[fear]] of taxes; but the [[prince]] ought to offer rewards [[reward]] to whoever wishes [[wish]] to do these things and designs in any way to [[honour]] his [[city]] or [[state]].
further, he ought to entertain the [[people]] with festivals and spectacles at convenient seasons of the year; and as every [[city]] is divided into guilds or into societies [[society]],[1] he ought to hold such bodies [[body]] in esteem, and associate with them sometimes, and show himself an [[example]] of courtesy and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty of his rank, for this he must never [[consent]] to abate in anything.
[1] “guilds or societies [[society]],” “in arti o in tribu.” “arti” were craft or [[trade]] guilds, cf. florio: “arte . . . a whole company of any [[trade]] in any [[city]] or corporation town.” the guilds of florence are most admirably described by mr edgcumbe staley in his [[work]] on the [[subject]] (methuen, 1906). [[institutions]] of a somewhat similar [[character]], called “artel,” [[exist]] in russia to-day, cf. sir mackenzie wallace’s “russia,” ed. 1905: “the sons [[son]] . . . were always during the working season members of an artel. in some of the larger towns there are artels of a much more complex kind— permanent associations, possessing large [[capital]], and pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the [[individual]] members.” the word “artel,” despite its apparent similarity, has, mr aylmer maude assures me, no connection with “ars” or “arte.” its root is that of the verb “rotisya,” to bind oneself by an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only another form of “rota,” which now signifies a “regimental company.” in both words the underlying [[idea]] is that of a [[body]] of [[men]] [[united]] by an oath. “tribu” were possibly gentile groups, [[united]] by [[common]] descent, and included individuals [[individual]] connected by [[marriage]]. perhaps our words “sects” or “clans” would be most appropriate.

chapter xxii.
concerning the secretaries of princes

the [[choice]] of servants is of no little importance to a [[prince]], and they are [[good]] or not according to the discrimination of the [[prince]]. and the first [[opinion]] which one forms of a [[prince]], and of his understanding, is by observing the [[men]] he has around him; and when they are capable and faithful he may always be considered [[wise]], because he has known how to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful. but when they are otherwise one cannot form a [[good]] [[opinion]] of him, for the prime error which he made was in choosing them.
there were none who knew messer antonio da venafro as the servant of pandolfo petrucci, [[prince]] of siena, who would not consider pandolfo to be a very clever [[man]] in having venafro for his servant. because there are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself; another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is the most excellent, the second is [[good]], the third is useless. therefore, it follows necessarily that, if pandolfo was not in the first rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has [[judgment]] to [[know]] [[good]] and [[bad]] when it is said and done, although he himself may not have the initiative, yet he can recognize the [[good]] and the [[bad]] in his servant, and the one he can [[praise]] and the other [[correct]]; thus the servant cannot [[hope]] to [[deceive]] him, and is kept honest.
but to enable a [[prince]] to form an [[opinion]] of his servant there is one test which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his own interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own [[profit]] in everything, such a [[man]] will never make a [[good]] servant, nor will you ever be able to trust him; because he who has the [[state]] of another in his hands ought never to [[think]] of himself, but always of his [[prince]], and never [[pay]] any attention to matters in which the [[prince]] is not concerned.
on the other hand, to keep his servant honest the [[prince]] ought to study him, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with him the honours [[honour]] and cares [[care]]; and at the same [[time]] let him see that he cannot stand alone, so that many honours [[honour]] may not make him [[desire]] more, many riches [[rich]] make him [[wish]] for more, and that many cares [[care]] may make him dread chances [[chance]]. when, therefore, servants, and princes [[prince]] towards servants, are thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise, the end will always be disastrous for either one or the other.
chapter xxiii.
how flatterers should be avoided

i do not [[wish]] to leave out an important branch of this [[subject]], for it is a danger from which princes [[prince]] are with difficulty preserved, unless they are very careful and discriminating. it is that of flatterers, of whom courts are full, because [[men]] are so self-complacent in their own affairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with difficulty from this pest, and if they [[wish]] to defend themselves they run the danger of falling into contempt. because there is no other way of guarding oneself from flatterers except letting [[men]] [[understand]] that to tell you the [[truth]] does not offend you; but when every one may tell you the [[truth]], [[respect]] for you abates.
therefore a [[wise]] [[prince]] ought to hold a third course by choosing the [[wise]] [[men]] in his [[state]], and giving to them only the [[liberty]] of speaking the [[truth]] to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires, and of none others; but he ought to [[question]] them upon everything, and listen to their opinions [[opinion]], and afterwards form his own conclusions. with these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry himself in such a way that each of them should [[know]] that, the more freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of these, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be steadfast in his resolutions. he who does otherwise is either overthrown by flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions [[opinion]] that he falls into contempt.
i [[wish]] on this [[subject]] to adduce a [[modern]] [[example]]. fra luca, the [[man]] of affairs to maximilian,[1] the [[present]] [[emperor]], speaking of his majesty, said: he consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything. this arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the above; for the [[emperor]] is a secretive man—he does not communicate his designs to any one, nor does he receive opinions [[opinion]] on them. but as in carrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are at once obstructed by those [[men]] whom he has around him, and he, being pliant, is diverted from them. hence it follows that those things he does one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he wishes [[wish]] or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions.
[1] maximilian i, born in 1459, died 1519, [[emperor]] of the holy roman [[empire]]. he [[married]], first, [[mary]], [[daughter]] of charles the bold; after her [[death]], bianca sforza; and thus became involved in italian [[politics]].

a [[prince]], therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he wishes [[wish]] and not when others [[wish]]; he ought rather to discourage every one from offering [[advice]] unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to be a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning the things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any consideration, has not told him the [[truth]], he should let his anger be [[felt]].
and if there are some who [[think]] that a [[prince]] who conveys an impression of his [[wisdom]] is not so through his own ability, but through the [[good]] advisers that he has around him, beyond [[doubt]] they are deceived, because this is an axiom which never fails: that a [[prince]] who is not [[wise]] himself will never take [[good]] [[advice]], unless by [[chance]] he has yielded his affairs entirely to one [[person]] who happens to be a very prudent [[man]]. in this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would not be for long, because such a governor would in a short [[time]] take away his [[state]] from him.
but if a [[prince]] who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more than one he will never get [[united]] counsels, nor will he [[know]] how to unite them. each of the counsellors will [[think]] of his own interests, and the [[prince]] will not [[know]] how to control them or to see through them. and they are not to be found otherwise, because [[men]] will always prove untrue to you unless they are kept honest by constraint. therefore it must be inferred that [[good]] counsels, whencesoever they come, are born of the [[wisdom]] of the [[prince]], and not the [[wisdom]] of the [[prince]] from [[good]] counsels.
chapter xxiv.
why the princes [[prince]] of [[italy]] have lost their states

the previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new [[prince]] to appear well established, and render him at once more secure and fixed in the [[state]] than if he had been long seated there. for the actions of a new [[prince]] are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more [[men]] and bind far tighter than ancient [[blood]]; because [[men]] are attracted more by the [[present]] than by the [[past]], and when they find the [[present]] [[good]] they enjoy it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost defence of a [[prince]] if he fails them not in other things. thus it will be a double [[glory]] for him to have established a new principality, and adorned and strengthened it with [[good]] laws [[law]], [[good]] arms, [[good]] allies, and with a [[good]] [[example]]; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a [[prince]], shall lose his [[state]] by want of [[wisdom]].
and if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in [[italy]] in our times [[time]], such as the [[king]] of naples, the duke of milan, and others, there will be found in them, firstly, one [[common]] defect in regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in the next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the [[people]] hostile, or if he has had the [[people]] friendly, he has not known how to secure the nobles [[noble]]. in the absence of these defects states that have [[power]] enough to keep an [[army]] in the field cannot be lost.
philip of macedon, not the [[father]] of alexander the [[great]], but he who was conquered by titus quintius, had not much territory compared to the greatness of the romans and of greece who attacked him, yet being a warlike [[man]] who knew how to attract the [[people]] and secure the nobles [[noble]], he sustained the [[war]] against his enemies [[enemy]] for many years, and if in the end he lost the dominion of some cities [[city]], nevertheless he retained the [[kingdom]].
therefore, do not let our princes [[prince]] accuse [[fortune]] for the loss of their principalities after so many years’ possession, but rather their own sloth, because in quiet times [[time]] they never [[thought]] there could be a [[change]] (it is a [[common]] defect in [[man]] not to make any provision in the calm against the tempest), and when afterwards the [[bad]] times [[time]] came they [[thought]] of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that the [[people]], disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would recall them. this course, when others fail, may be [[good]], but it is very [[bad]] to have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would never [[wish]] to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on to restore you. this again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable, [[certain]], and durable that depend on yourself and your valour.
chapter xxv.
what [[fortune]] can effect in [[human]] affairs and how to withstand her

it is not unknown to me how many [[men]] have had, and still have, the [[opinion]] that the affairs of the [[world]] are in such [[wise]] governed by [[fortune]] and by [[god]] that [[men]] with their [[wisdom]] cannot direct them and that no one can even [[help]] them; and because of this they would have us [[believe]] that it is not necessary to [[labour]] much in affairs, but to let [[chance]] govern them. this [[opinion]] has been more credited in our times [[time]] because of the [[great]] changes [[change]] in affairs which have been seen, and may still be seen, every day, beyond all [[human]] conjecture. sometimes pondering over this, i am in some [[degree]] inclined to their [[opinion]]. nevertheless, not to extinguish our [[free]] will, i hold it to be true that [[fortune]] is the arbiter of one-half of our actions,[1] but that she still leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.
[1] frederick the [[great]] was accustomed to say: “the older one gets the more convinced one becomes that his majesty [[king]] [[chance]] does three-quarters of the [[business]] of this miserable [[universe]].” sorel’s “eastern [[question]].”

i compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood overflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away the soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to its [[violence]], without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet, though its [[nature]] be such, it does not [[follow]] therefore that [[men]], when the weather becomes [[fair]], shall not make provision, both with defences and barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may pass away by canal, and their [[force]] be neither so unrestrained nor so dangerous. so it happens with [[fortune]], who shows her [[power]] where valour has not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces [[force]] where she knows [[know]] that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain her.
and if you will consider [[italy]], which is the seat of these changes [[change]], and which has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open [[country]] without barriers and without any defence. for if it had been defended by proper valour, as are germany, [[spain]], and [[france]], either this [[invasion]] would not have made the [[great]] changes [[change]] it has made or it would not have come at all. and this i consider enough to say concerning [[resistance]] to [[fortune]] in general.
but confining myself more to the particular, i say that a [[prince]] may be seen [[happy]] to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any [[change]] of disposition or [[character]]. this, i [[believe]], arises firstly from causes that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the [[prince]] who relies entirely on [[fortune]] is lost when it changes [[change]]. i [[believe]] also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times [[time]], and that he whose actions do not accord with the times [[time]] will not be successful. because [[men]] are seen, in affairs that lead to the end which every [[man]] has before him, namely, [[glory]] and riches [[rich]], to get there by various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by [[force]], another by [[skill]]; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method. one can also see of two cautious [[men]] the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly, two [[men]] by different observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times [[time]]. this follows from what i have said, that two [[men]] working differently bring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains his object and the other does not.
changes in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs himself with caution and patience, times [[time]] and affairs converge in such a way that his administration is successful, his [[fortune]] is made; but if times [[time]] and affairs [[change]], he is ruined if he does not [[change]] his course of action. but a [[man]] is not often found sufficiently circumspect to [[know]] how to accommodate himself to the [[change]], both because he cannot deviate from what [[nature]] inclines him to do, and also because, having always prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it is well to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious [[man]], when it is [[time]] to turn adventurous, does not [[know]] how to do it, hence he is ruined; but had he changed his conduct with the times [[time]] [[fortune]] would not have changed.
pope julius the second went to [[work]] impetuously in all his affairs, and found the times [[time]] and circumstances conform so well to that line of action that he always met with [[success]]. consider his first enterprise against bologna, messer giovanni bentivogli being still alive. the venetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the [[king]] of [[spain]], and he had the enterprise still under discussion with the [[king]] of [[france]]; nevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his accustomed boldness and energy, a move which made [[spain]] and the venetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from [[fear]], the former from [[desire]] to recover the [[kingdom]] of naples; on the other hand, he drew after him the [[king]] of [[france]], because that [[king]], having observed the movement, and desiring to make the [[pope]] his friend so as to humble the venetians, found it impossible to refuse him. therefore julius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff with simple [[human]] [[wisdom]] could have done; for if he had waited in [[rome]] until he could get away, with his plans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would have done, he would never have succeeded. because the [[king]] of [[france]] would have made a thousand excuses, and the others would have raised a thousand fears [[fear]].
i will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they all succeeded, for the shortness of his [[life]] did not let him [[experience]] the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go cautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have deviated from those ways to which [[nature]] inclined him.
i conclude, therefore that, [[fortune]] being changeful and [[mankind]] steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement [[men]] are successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. for my part i consider that it is [[better]] to be adventurous than cautious, because [[fortune]] is a woman, and if you [[wish]] to keep her under it is necessary to beat and ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who go to [[work]] more coldly. she is, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of [[young]] [[men]], because they are less cautious, more [[violent]], and with more audacity command her.
chapter xxvi.
an exhortation to liberate [[italy]] from the barbarians

having carefully considered the [[subject]] of the above discourses, and wondering within myself whether the [[present]] times [[time]] were propitious to a new [[prince]], and whether there were elements that would give an opportunity to a [[wise]] and [[virtuous]] one to introduce a new order of things which would do [[honour]] to him and [[good]] to the [[people]] of this [[country]], it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new [[prince]] that i never knew a [[time]] more fit than the [[present]].
and if, as i said, it was necessary that the [[people]] of [[israel]] should be captive so as to make manifest the ability of [[moses]]; that the persians should be [[oppressed]] by the medes so as to discover the greatness of the [[soul]] of cyrus; and that the athenians should be dispersed to illustrate the capabilities of theseus: then at the [[present]] [[time]], in order to discover the [[virtue]] of an italian spirit, it was necessary that [[italy]] should be reduced to the extremity that she is now in, that she should be more enslaved than the hebrews, more [[oppressed]] than the persians, more scattered than the athenians; without head, without order, beaten, despoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every [[kind]] of desolation.
although lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us [[think]] he was ordained by [[god]] for our redemption, nevertheless it was afterwards seen, in the height of his [[career]], that [[fortune]] rejected him; so that [[italy]], left as without [[life]], waits for him who shall yet heal her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of lombardy, to the swindling and taxing of the [[kingdom]] and of tuscany, and cleanse those sores that for long have festered. it is seen how she entreats [[god]] to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs [[wrong]] and barbarous insolencies. it is seen also that she is ready and willing to [[follow]] a banner if only someone will raise it.
nor is there to be seen at [[present]] one in whom she can place more [[hope]] than in your illustrious house,[1] with its valour and [[fortune]], favoured by [[god]] and by the [[church]] of which it is now the [[chief]], and which could be made the head of this redemption. this will not be difficult if you will recall to yourself the actions and lives [[life]] of the [[men]] i have named. and although they were [[great]] and wonderful [[men]], yet they were [[men]], and each one of them had no more opportunity than the [[present]] offers, for their enterprises were neither more just nor easier than this, nor was [[god]] more their friend than he is yours.
[1] giuliano de medici. he had just been created a cardinal by leo x. in 1523 giuliano was elected [[pope]], and took the title of clement vii.

with us there is [[great]] [[justice]], because that [[war]] is just which is necessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other [[hope]] but in them. here there is the [[greatest]] willingness, and where the willingness is [[great]] the difficulties cannot be [[great]] if you will only [[follow]] those [[men]] to whom i have directed your attention. further than this, how extraordinarily the ways of [[god]] have been manifested beyond [[example]]: the sea is divided, a cloud has [[led]] the way, the rock has poured forth water, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to your greatness; you ought to do the rest. [[god]] is not willing to do everything, and thus take away our [[free]] will and that share of [[glory]] which belongs to us.
and it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named italians have been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious house; and if in so many revolutions [[revolution]] in [[italy]], and in so many campaigns, it has always appeared as if [[military]] [[virtue]] were exhausted, this has happened because the old order of things was not [[good]], and none of us have known how to find a new one. and nothing honours [[honour]] a [[man]] more than to establish new laws [[law]] and new ordinances when he himself was newly risen. such things when they are well founded and dignified will make him revered and admired, and in [[italy]] there are not wanting opportunities to bring such into use in every form.
here there is [[great]] valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head. look attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how superior the italians are in [[strength]], dexterity, and subtlety. but when it comes to armies [[army]] they do not bear comparison, and this springs entirely from the insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are capable are not [[obedient]], and each one seems to himself to [[know]], there having never been any one so distinguished above the rest, either by valour or [[fortune]], that others would yield to him. hence it is that for so long a [[time]], and during so much fighting in the [[past]] twenty years, whenever there has been an [[army]] wholly italian, it has always given a [[poor]] account of itself; the first witness to this is il taro, afterwards allesandria, capua, genoa, vaila, bologna, mestri.[2]
[2] the battles [[battle]] of il taro, 1495; alessandria, 1499; capua, 1501; genoa, 1507; vaila, 1509; bologna, 1511; mestri, 1513.

if, therefore, your illustrious house wishes [[wish]] to [[follow]] these remarkable [[men]] who have redeemed their [[country]], it is necessary before all things, as a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your own forces [[force]], because there can be no more faithful, truer, or [[better]] soldiers. and although singly they are [[good]], altogether they will be much [[better]] when they find themselves commanded by their [[prince]], honoured by him, and maintained at his expense. therefore it is necessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended against foreigners by italian valour.
and although swiss and spanish infantry may be considered very formidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by [[reason]] of which a third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be relied upon to overthrow them. for the spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close combat. owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the spaniards are unable to resist french cavalry, and the switzers are overthrown by spanish infantry. and although a complete proof of this latter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the [[battle]] of ravenna, when the spanish infantry were confronted by [[german]] battalions, who [[follow]] the same tactics as the swiss; when the spaniards, by agility of [[body]] and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of the germans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been over with them. it is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but a variation upon the old. and these are the [[kind]] of improvements which confer [[reputation]] and [[power]] upon a new [[prince]].
this opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for letting [[italy]] at [[last]] see her liberator appear. nor can one express the [[love]] with which he would be received in all those provinces which have [[suffered]] so much from these [[foreign]] scourings, with what thirst for [[revenge]], with what stubborn [[faith]], with what devotion, with what tears. what door would be closed to him? who would refuse [[obedience]] to him? what envy would hinder him? what italian would refuse him homage? to all of us this barbarous dominion stinks. let, therefore, your illustrious house take up this charge with that [[courage]] and [[hope]] with which all just enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard our native [[country]] may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be verified that saying of petrarch:
virtu contro al furore
    prendera l’arme, e fia il combatter corto:
che l’antico valore
    negli italici cuor non e ancor morto.

virtue against fury shall advance the [[fight]],
    and it i’ th’ combat soon shall put to flight:
for the old roman valour is not [[dead]],
    nor in th’ italians’ brests extinguished.

description of the methods adopted by the duke valentino when murdering vitellozzo vitelli, oliverotto da fermo, the signor pagolo, and the duke di gravina orsini

by nicolo machiavelli

the duke valentino had returned from lombardy, where he had been to clear himself with the [[king]] of [[france]] from the calumnies which had been raised against him by the florentines concerning the rebellion of arezzo and other towns in the val di chiana, and had arrived at imola, whence he intended with his [[army]] to enter upon the campaign against giovanni bentivogli, the [[tyrant]] of bologna: for he intended to bring that [[city]] under his domination, and to make it the head of his romagnian duchy.
these matters coming to the [[knowledge]] of the vitelli and orsini and their following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too powerful, and it was feared that, having seized bologna, he would seek to [[destroy]] them in order that he might become supreme in [[italy]]. upon this a meeting was called at magione in the district of perugia, to which came the cardinal, pagolo, and the duke di gravina orsini, vitellozzo vitelli, oliverotto da fermo, gianpagolo baglioni, the [[tyrant]] of perugia, and messer antonio da venafro, sent by pandolfo petrucci, the [[prince]] of siena. here were discussed the [[power]] and [[courage]] of the duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which might otherwise bring danger to the rest of being ruined. and they decided not to abandon the bentivogli, but to strive to [[win]] over the florentines; and they sent their [[men]] to one place and another, promising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite with them against the [[common]] [[enemy]]. this meeting was at once reported throughout all [[italy]], and those who were discontented under the duke, among whom were the [[people]] of urbino, took [[hope]] of effecting a [[revolution]].
thus it arose that, [[men’s]] minds [[mind]] being thus unsettled, it was decided by [[certain]] [[men]] of urbino to seize the fortress of san leo, which was held for the duke, and which they captured by the following means. the castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there; so the conspirators watched, and when [[certain]] beams which were being carried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from being drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping upon the bridge and thence into the fortress. upon this capture being effected, the whole [[state]] rebelled and recalled the old duke, being encouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the diet at magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.
those who heard of the rebellion at urbino [[thought]] they would not lose the opportunity, and at once assembled their [[men]] so as to take any town, should any remain in the hands of the duke in that [[state]]; and they sent again to florence to beg that [[republic]] to join with them in destroying the [[common]] firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and that they ought not to wait for another opportunity.
but the florentines, from [[hatred]], for sundry reasons [[reason]], of the vitelli and orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent nicolo machiavelli, their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against his enemies [[enemy]]. the duke was found full of [[fear]] at imola, because, against everybody’s expectation, his soldiers had at once gone over to the [[enemy]] and he found himself disarmed and [[war]] at his door. but recovering [[courage]] from the offers of the florentines, he decided to temporize before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him, and to negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance. this latter he obtained in two ways, by sending to the [[king]] of [[france]] for [[men]] and by enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort: to all he gave [[money]].
notwithstanding this, his enemies [[enemy]] drew near to him, and approached fossombrone, where they encountered some [[men]] of the duke and, with the aid of the orsini and vitelli, routed them. when this happened, the duke resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with offers of reconciliation, and being a most [[perfect]] dissembler he did not fail in any practices to make the insurgents [[understand]] that he wished every [[man]] who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough for him to have the title of [[prince]], whilst others might have the principality.
and the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent signor pagolo to him to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their [[army]] to a standstill. but the duke did not stop his preparations, and took every [[care]] to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such preparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his [[troops]] in separate parties to every part of the romagna. in the meanwhile there came also to him five hundred french lancers, and although he found himself sufficiently [[strong]] to take vengeance on his enemies [[enemy]] in open [[war]], he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to outwit them, and for this [[reason]] he did not stop the [[work]] of reconciliation.
and that this might be effected the duke concluded a [[peace]] with them in which he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand ducats at once; he promised not to injure the bentivogli; and he formed an [[alliance]] with giovanni; and moreover he would not [[force]] them to come personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so. on the other hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of urbino and other places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and not to make [[war]] against or ally themselves with any one without his permission.
this reconciliation being completed, guido ubaldo, the duke of urbino, again fled to venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in his [[state]]; because, trusting in the [[people]], he did not [[wish]] that the fortresses, which he did not [[think]] he could defend, should be held by the [[enemy]], since by these means a check would be kept upon his [[friends]]. but the duke valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed his [[men]] throughout the romagna, set out for imola at the end of november together with his french men-at-arms: thence he went to cesena, where he stayed some [[time]] to negotiate with the envoys of the vitelli and orsini, who had assembled with their [[men]] in the duchy of urbino, as to the enterprise in which they should now take part; but nothing being concluded, oliverotto da fermo was sent to propose that if the duke wished to undertake an expedition against tuscany they were ready; if he did not [[wish]] it, then they would besiege sinigalia. to this the duke replied that he did not [[wish]] to enter into [[war]] with tuscany, and thus become hostile to the florentines, but that he was very willing to proceed against sinigalia.
it happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give it up to any one but the duke in [[person]]; therefore they exhorted him to come there. this appeared a [[good]] opportunity to the duke, as, being invited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no suspicions. and the more to reassure them, he allowed all the french men-at-arms who were with him in lombardy to depart, except the hundred lancers under mons. di candales, his brother-in-law. he left cesena about the middle of december, and went to fano, and with the utmost cunning and cleverness he persuaded the vitelli and orsini to wait for him at sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance would cast a [[doubt]] upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation, and that he was a [[man]] who wished to make use of the arms and councils of his [[friends]]. but vitellozzo remained very stubborn, for the [[death]] of his [[brother]] warned him that he should not offend a [[prince]] and afterwards trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by pagolo orsini, whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises, he agreed to wait.
upon this the duke, before his departure from fano, which was to be on 30th december 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most trusted followers, among whom were don michele and the monsignor d’euna, who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as vitellozzo, pagolo orsini, the duke di gravina, and oliverotto should arrive, his followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting [[certain]] [[men]] to [[certain]] pairs, who should entertain them until they reached sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they came to the duke’s quarters, where they should be seized.
the duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to assemble by daybreak at the metauro, a river five miles distant from fano, and await him there. he found himself, therefore, on the [[last]] day of december at the metauro with his [[men]], and having sent a cavalcade of about two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the infantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.
fano and sinigalia are two cities [[city]] of la marca situated on the shore of the adriatic sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who goes towards sinigalia has the mountains on his [[right]] hand, the bases of which are touched by the sea in some places. the [[city]] of sinigalia is distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot and from the shore about a mile. on the side opposite to the [[city]] runs a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards fano, facing the high road. thus he who draws near to sinigalia comes for a [[good]] space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river which passes by sinigalia. if he turns to his left hand along the bank of it, and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge which crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that leads into sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. before this gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which the bank of the river forms one side.
the vitelli and orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and to [[honour]] him in [[person]], sent away their [[men]] to several castles distant from sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the [[men]] of the duke; and they left in sinigalia only oliverotto and his band, which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty horsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. matters having been thus arranged, the duke valentino left for sinigalia, and when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass over, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and the other towards the [[country]], and a way was left in the middle through which the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.
vitellozzo, pagolo, and the duke di gravina on mules, accompanied by a few horsemen, went towards the duke; vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his approaching death—a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the [[man]] and his former [[fortune]], caused some amazement. and it is said that when he parted from his [[men]] before setting out for sinigalia to meet the duke he acted as if it were his [[last]] parting from them. he recommended his house and its fortunes [[fortune]] to his captains, and advised his nephews that it was not the [[fortune]] of their house, but the virtues [[virtue]] of their fathers [[father]] that should be kept in [[mind]]. these three, therefore, came before the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him with goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were commissioned to look after them.
but the duke noticing that oliverotto, who had remained with his band in sinigalia, was missing—for oliverotto was waiting in the square before his quarters near the river, keeping his [[men]] in order and drilling them—signalled with his eye to don michelle, to whom the [[care]] of oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that oliverotto should not escape. therefore don michele rode off and joined oliverotto, telling him that it was not [[right]] to keep his [[men]] out of their quarters, because these might be taken up by the [[men]] of the duke; and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come himself to meet the duke. and oliverotto, having taken this [[advice]], came before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and oliverotto, having made his obeisance, joined the others.
so the whole party entered sinigalia, dismounted at the duke’s quarters, and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made them prisoners [[prisoner]]; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that the [[men]] of oliverotto and the orsini should be stripped of their arms. those of oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of the orsini and vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment of the destruction of their masters, had [[time]] to prepare themselves, and bearing in [[mind]] the valour and discipline of the orsinian and vitellian houses, they stood together against the hostile forces [[force]] of the [[country]] and saved themselves.
but the duke’s soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the [[men]] of oliverotto, began to sack sinigalia, and if the duke had not repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have completely sacked it. night having come and the tumult being silenced, the duke prepared to kill vitellozzo and oliverotto; he [[led]] them into a room and caused them to be strangled. neither of them used words in keeping with their [[past]] lives [[life]]: vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of the [[pope]] full pardon for his sins [[sin]]; oliverotto cringed and laid the blame for all injuries against the duke on vitellozzo. pagolo and the duke di gravina orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from [[rome]] that the [[pope]] had taken the cardinal orsino, the archbishop of florence, and messer jacopo da santa croce. after which news, on 18th january 1502, in the castle of pieve, they also were strangled in the same way.
the [[life]] of castruccio castracani of lucca

castruccio castracani 1284-1328
it appears, dearest zanobi and luigi, a wonderful thing to those who have considered the matter, that all [[men]], or the larger number of them, who have performed [[great]] deeds in the [[world]], and excelled all others in their day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity; or have been aggrieved by [[fortune]] in some outrageous way. they have either been exposed to the [[mercy]] of wild beasts, or they have had so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to be sons [[son]] of jove or of some other deity. it would be wearisome to relate who these persons [[person]] may have been because they are well known to everybody, and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to those who [[read]] them, they are omitted. i [[believe]] that these lowly beginnings of [[great]] [[men]] occur because [[fortune]] is desirous of showing to the [[world]] that such [[men]] owe much to her and little to [[wisdom]], because she begins to show her hand when [[wisdom]] can really take no part in their [[career]]: thus all [[success]] must be attributed to her. castruccio castracani of lucca was one of those [[men]] who did [[great]] deeds, if he is measured by the times [[time]] in which he lived and the [[city]] in which he was born; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth, as the course of this [[history]] will show. it appeared to be desirable to recall his memory, because i have discerned in him such indications of valour and [[fortune]] as should make him a [[great]] exemplar to [[men]]. i [[think]] also that i ought to call your attention to his actions, because you of all [[men]] i [[know]] delight most in [[noble]] deeds.
the [[family]] of castracani was formerly numbered among the [[noble]] families [[family]] of lucca, but in the days of which i speak it had somewhat fallen in estate, as so often happens in this [[world]]. to this [[family]] was born a [[son]] antonio, who became a [[priest]] of the order of san michele of lucca, and for this [[reason]] was honoured with the title of messer antonio. he had an only sister, who had been [[married]] to buonaccorso cenami, but buonaccorso dying she became a widow, and not wishing to [[marry]] again went to [[live]] with her [[brother]]. messer antonio had a vineyard behind the house where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any [[person]] could have access to it without difficulty. one morning, shortly after sunrise, madonna dianora, as the sister of messer antonio was called, had [[occasion]] to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves of a vine she turned her [[eyes]] in that direction, and heard something resembling the cry of an infant. whereupon she went towards it, and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and who seemed to be crying for its [[mother]]. partly wondering and partly fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it to the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is customary, and showed it to messer antonio when he returned [[home]]. when he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised or compassionate than his sister. they discussed between themselves what should be done, and seeing that he was [[priest]] and that she had no [[children]], they finally determined to bring it up. they had a nurse for it, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. they baptized it, and gave it the name of castruccio after their [[father]]. as the years passed castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those lessons which messer antonio imparted to him. messer antonio intended to make a [[priest]] of him, and in [[time]] would have inducted him into his canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with this object; but antonio discovered that the [[character]] of castruccio was quite unfitted for the priesthood. as soon as castruccio reached the [[age]] of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of messer antonio and madonna dianora and no longer to [[fear]] them; he left off reading ecclesiastical books [[book]], and turned to playing with arms, delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running, leaping, and wrestling with other boys. in all exercises he far excelled his companions in [[courage]] and bodily [[strength]], and if at any [[time]] he did turn to books [[book]], only those pleased him which told of wars [[war]] and the mighty deeds of [[men]]. messer antonio beheld all this with vexation and [[sorrow]].
there lived in the [[city]] of lucca a gentleman of the guinigi [[family]], named messer francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches [[rich]], bodily [[strength]], and valour excelled all other [[men]] in lucca. he had often fought under the command of the visconti of milan, and as a ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in lucca. this gentleman resided in lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most mornings and evenings under the balcony of the podesta, which is at the top of the square of san michele, the finest square in lucca, and he had often seen castruccio taking part with other [[children]] of the street in those games of which i have spoken. noticing that castruccio far excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a [[royal]] [[authority]] over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, messer francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. being informed of the circumstances of the bringing up of castruccio he [[felt]] a greater [[desire]] to have him near to him. therefore he called him one day and [[asked]] him whether he would more willingly [[live]] in the house of a gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in the house of a [[priest]], where he would learn nothing but masses and the services of the [[church]]. messer francesco could see that it pleased castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by messer francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable, nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and take up those of a soldier. this reply delighted messer francesco, and in a very short [[time]] he obtained the [[consent]] of messer antonio, who was driven to yield by his [[knowledge]] of the [[nature]] of the lad, and the [[fear]] that he would not be able to hold him much longer.
thus castruccio passed from the house of messer antonio the [[priest]] to the house of messer francesco guinigi the soldier, and it was astonishing to find that in a very short [[time]] he manifested all that [[virtue]] and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true gentleman. in the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and tournaments, although still a [[youth]], he was observed beyond all others, and he excelled in all exercises of [[strength]] and dexterity. but what enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to others, for he was deferential to the [[great]] [[men]], modest with his equals [[equal]], and courteous to his inferiors. these gifts made him beloved, not only by all the guinigi [[family]], but by all lucca. when castruccio had reached his eighteenth year, the ghibellines were driven from pavia by the guelphs, and messer francesco was sent by the visconti to assist the ghibellines, and with him went castruccio, in charge of his forces [[force]]. castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and [[courage]] in this expedition, acquiring greater [[reputation]] than any other captain, and his name and fame were known, not only in pavia, but throughout all lombardy.
castruccio, having returned to lucca in far higher estimation than he left it, did not omit to use all the means in his [[power]] to gain as many [[friends]] as he could, neglecting none of those [[arts]] which are necessary for that [[purpose]]. about this [[time]] messer francesco died, leaving a [[son]] thirteen years of [[age]] named pagolo, and having appointed castruccio to be his son’s tutor and administrator of his estate. before he died francesco called castruccio to him, and prayed him to show pagolo that goodwill which he (francesco) had always shown to him, and to render to the [[son]] the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the [[father]]. upon the [[death]] of francesco, castruccio became the governor and tutor of pagolo, which increased enormously his [[power]] and position, and created a [[certain]] amount of envy against him in lucca in place of the former universal goodwill, for many [[men]] suspected him of harbouring [[tyrannical]] intentions. among these the leading [[man]] was giorgio degli opizi, the head of the guelph party. this [[man]] hoped after the [[death]] of messer francesco to become the [[chief]] [[man]] in lucca, but it seemed to him that castruccio, with the [[great]] abilities which he already showed, and holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity; therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob castruccio of his eminence. castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that messer giorgio might be able to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of [[king]] ruberto of naples and have him driven out of lucca.
the [[lord]] of pisa at that [[time]] was uguccione of the faggiuola of arezzo, who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became their [[lord]]. there resided in [[paris]] some exiled ghibellines from lucca, with whom castruccio held communications with the object of effecting their restoration by the [[help]] of uguccione. castruccio also brought into his plans [[friends]] from lucca who would not endure the [[authority]] of the opizi. having fixed upon a plan to be followed, castruccio cautiously fortified the tower of the onesti, filling it with supplies and munitions of [[war]], in order that it might stand a siege for a few days in case of need. when the night came which had been agreed upon with uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and pisa with many [[men]], the signal was given, and without being observed uguccione approached the gate of san piero and set [[fire]] to the portcullis. castruccio raised a [[great]] uproar within the [[city]], calling the [[people]] to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. uguccione entered with his [[men]], poured through the town, and killed messer giorgio with all his [[family]] and many of his [[friends]] and supporters. the governor was driven out, and the [[government]] reformed according to the wishes [[wish]] of uguccione, to the detriment of the [[city]], because it was found that more than one hundred families [[family]] were exiled at that [[time]]. of those who fled, part went to florence and part to pistoia, which [[city]] was the headquarters of the guelph party, and for this [[reason]] it became most hostile to uguccione and the lucchese.
as it now appeared to the florentines and others of the guelph party that the ghibellines absorbed too much [[power]] in tuscany, they determined to restore the exiled guelphs to lucca. they assembled a large [[army]] in the val di nievole, and seized montecatini; from thence they marched to montecarlo, in order to secure the [[free]] passage into lucca. upon this uguccione assembled his pisan and lucchese forces [[force]], and with a number of [[german]] cavalry which he drew out of lombardy, he moved against the quarters of the florentines, who upon the appearance of the [[enemy]] withdrew from montecarlo, and posted themselves between montecatini and pescia. uguccione now took up a position near to montecarlo, and within about two miles of the [[enemy]], and slight skirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence. owing to the illness of uguccione, the pisans and lucchese delayed coming to [[battle]] with the [[enemy]]. uguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the [[army]] in the hands of castruccio. this [[change]] brought about the ruin of the guelphs, who, thinking that the hostile [[army]] having lost its captain had lost its head, grew over-confident. castruccio observed this, and allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this [[belief]]; he also showed signs of [[fear]], and did not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used. on the other side, the guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidences of [[fear]], and every day they drew out in the order of [[battle]] in front of the [[army]] of castruccio. presently, deeming that the [[enemy]] was sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decided to join [[battle]] with them. first he spoke a few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of [[victory]] if they would but obey his commands. castruccio had noticed how the [[enemy]] had placed all his [[best]] [[troops]] in the centre of the line of [[battle]], and his less reliable [[men]] on the wings of the [[army]]; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant [[men]] on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre. observing this order of [[battle]], he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight of the hostile [[army]], who, as usual, had come in their insolence to defy him. he then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the wings. thus, when they came into contact with the [[enemy]], only the wings of the two armies [[army]] became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained out of action, for these two portions of the line of [[battle]] were separated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach each other. by this expedient the more valiant part of castruccio’s [[men]] were opposed to the weaker part of the enemy’s [[troops]], and the most efficient [[men]] of the [[enemy]] were disengaged; and thus the florentines were unable to [[fight]] with those who were arrayed opposite to them, or to give any assistance to their own flanks. so, without much difficulty, castruccio put the [[enemy]] to flight on both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to attack, without having a [[chance]] of displaying their valour. the defeat was complete, and the loss in [[men]] very heavy, there being more than ten thousand [[men]] killed with many officers and knights of the guelph party in tuscany, and also many princes [[prince]] who had come to [[help]] them, among whom were piero, the [[brother]] of [[king]] ruberto, and carlo, his nephew, and filippo, the [[lord]] of taranto. on the part of castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred [[men]], among whom was francesco, the [[son]] of uguccione, who, being [[young]] and rash, was killed in the first onset.
this [[victory]] so greatly increased the [[reputation]] of castruccio that uguccione conceived some [[jealousy]] and suspicion of him, because it appeared to uguccione that this [[victory]] had given him no increase of [[power]], but rather than diminished it. being of this [[mind]], he only waited for an opportunity to give effect to it. this occurred on the [[death]] of pier agnolo micheli, a [[man]] of [[great]] repute and abilities in lucca, the murderer of whom fled to the house of castruccio for refuge. on the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were driven off by castruccio, and the murderer escaped. this affair coming to the [[knowledge]] of uguccione, who was then at pisa, it appeared to him a proper opportunity to punish castruccio. he therefore sent for his [[son]] neri, who was the governor of lucca, and commissioned him to take castruccio [[prisoner]] at a banquet and put him to [[death]]. castruccio, fearing no [[evil]], went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertained at supper, and then thrown into prison. but neri, fearing to put him to [[death]] lest the [[people]] should be incensed, kept him alive, in order to hear further from his [[father]] concerning his intentions. ugucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his [[son]], and at once set out from pisa to lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the [[business]] in his own way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the pisans rebelled and put his deputy to [[death]] and created count gaddo della gherardesca their [[lord]]. before uguccione reached lucca he heard of the occurrences at pisa, but it did not appear [[wise]] to him to turn back, lest the lucchese with the [[example]] of pisa before them should close their gates against him. but the lucchese, having heard of what had happened at pisa, availed themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of castruccio, notwithstanding that uguccione had arrived in their [[city]]. they first began to speak of it in private circles, afterwards openly in the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult, and with arms in their hands went to uguccione and demanded that castruccio should be set at [[liberty]]. uguccione, fearing that worse might happen, released him from prison. whereupon castruccio gathered his [[friends]] around him, and with the [[help]] of the [[people]] attacked uguccione; who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode away with his [[friends]] to lombardy, to the lords [[lord]] of scale, where he died in [[poverty]].
but castruccio from being a [[prisoner]] became almost a [[prince]] in lucca, and he carried himself so discreetly with his [[friends]] and the [[people]] that they appointed him captain of their [[army]] for one year. having obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in [[war]], he planned the recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of uguccione, and with the [[help]] of the pisans, with whom he had concluded a treaty, he marched to serezzana. to capture this place he constructed a fort against it, which is called to-day zerezzanello; in the course of two months castruccio captured the town. with the [[reputation]] gained at that siege, he rapidly seized massa, carrara, and lavenza, and in a short [[time]] had overrun the whole of lunigiana. in order to close the pass which leads from lombardy to lunigiana, he besieged pontremoli and wrested it from the hands of messer anastagio palavicini, who was the [[lord]] of it. after this [[victory]] he returned to lucca, and was welcomed by the whole [[people]]. and now castruccio, deeming it imprudent any longer to defer making himself a [[prince]], got himself created the [[lord]] of lucca by the [[help]] of pazzino del poggio, puccinello dal portico, francesco boccansacchi, and cecco guinigi, all of whom he had corrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected [[prince]] by the [[people]]. at this [[time]] frederick of bavaria, the [[king]] of the romans, came into [[italy]] to assume the imperial [[crown]], and castruccio, in order that he might make [[friends]] with him, met him at the head of five hundred horsemen. castruccio had left as his deputy in lucca, pagolo guinigi, who was held in high estimation, because of the people’s [[love]] for the memory of his [[father]]. castruccio was received in [[great]] [[honour]] by frederick, and many privileges [[privilege]] were conferred upon him, and he was appointed the emperor’s lieutenant in tuscany. at this [[time]] the pisans were in [[great]] [[fear]] of gaddo della gherardesca, whom they had driven out of pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to frederick. frederick created castruccio the [[lord]] of pisa, and the pisans, in dread of the guelph party, and particularly of the florentines, were constrained to accept him as their [[lord]].
frederick, having appointed a governor in [[rome]] to watch his italian affairs, returned to germany. all the tuscan and lombardian ghibellines, who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to castruccio for [[help]] and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his [[country]], if enabled to recover it with his assistance. among these exiles were matteo guidi, nardo scolari, lapo uberti, gerozzo nardi, and piero buonaccorsi, all exiled florentines and ghibellines. castruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of all tuscany by the aid of these [[men]] and of his own forces [[force]]; and in order to gain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a league with messer matteo visconti, the [[prince]] of milan, and organized for him the forces [[force]] of his [[city]] and the [[country]] districts. as lucca had five gates, he divided his own [[country]] districts into five parts, which he supplied with arms, and enrolled the [[men]] under captains and ensigns, so that he could quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers, without those whom he could summon to his assistance from pisa. while he surrounded himself with these forces [[force]] and allies, it happened at messer matteo visconti was attacked by the guelphs of piacenza, who had driven out the ghibellines with the assistance of a florentine [[army]] and the [[king]] ruberto. messer matteo called upon castruccio to invade the florentines in their own territories, so that, being attacked at [[home]], they should be compelled to draw their [[army]] out of lombardy in order to defend themselves. castruccio invaded the valdarno, and seized fucecchio and san miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the [[country]]. whereupon the florentines recalled their [[army]], which had scarcely reached tuscany, when castruccio was forced by other necessities to return to lucca.
there resided in the [[city]] of lucca the poggio [[family]], who were so powerful that they could not only elevate castruccio, but even advance him to the [[dignity]] of [[prince]]; and it appearing to them they had not received such rewards [[reward]] for their services as they deserved, they incited other families [[family]] to rebel and to drive castruccio out of lucca. they found their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set upon the lieutenant whom castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him. they endeavoured to raise the [[people]] in revolt, but stefano di poggio, a peaceable old [[man]] who had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened and compelled them by his [[authority]] to lay down their arms; and he offered to be their mediator with castruccio to obtain from him what they [[desired]]. therefore they laid down their arms with no greater [[intelligence]] than they had taken them up. castruccio, having heard the news of what had happened at lucca, at once put pagolo guinigi in command of the [[army]], and with a troop of cavalry set out for [[home]]. contrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he posted his [[men]] in the most advantageous places throughout the [[city]]. as it appeared to stefano that castruccio ought to be very much obliged to him, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf, for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged castruccio to pardon the other members of his [[family]] by [[reason]] of their [[youth]], their former friendships [[friendship]], and the obligations which castruccio was under to their house. to this castruccio graciously responded, and begged stefano to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more [[pleasure]] to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him [[anxiety]] to hear of its inception. he encouraged stefano to bring his [[family]] to him, saying that he thanked [[god]] for having given him the opportunity of showing his clemency and liberality. upon the word of stefano and castruccio they surrendered, and with stefano were immediately thrown into prison and put to [[death]]. meanwhile the florentines had recovered san miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to castruccio to make [[peace]], as it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at lucca to leave him. he approached the florentines with the proposal of a truce, which they readily entertained, for they were weary of the [[war]], and desirous of getting rid of the expenses of it. a treaty was concluded with them for two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests they had made. castruccio thus released from this trouble, turned his attention to affairs in lucca, and in order that he should not again be [[subject]] to the perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various pretences and reasons [[reason]], first wiped out all those who by their [[ambition]] might aspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving them of [[country]] and [[property]], and those whom he had in his hands of [[life]] also, stating that he had found by [[experience]] that none of them were to be trusted. then for his further security he raised a fortress in lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out of the [[state]].
whilst castruccio made [[peace]] with the florentines, and strengthened his position in lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open [[war]], of increasing his importance elsewhere. it appeared to him that if he could get possession of pistoia, he would have one foot in florence, which was his [[great]] [[desire]]. he, therefore, in various ways made [[friends]] with the mountaineers, and worked matters so in pistoia that both parties confided their secrets to him. pistoia was divided, as it always had been, into the bianchi and neri parties; the head of the bianchi was bastiano di possente, and of the neri, jacopo da gia. each of these [[men]] held secret communications with castruccio, and each [[desired]] to drive the other out of the [[city]]; and, after many threatenings, they came to blows. jacopo fortified himself at the florentine gate, bastiano at that of the lucchese side of the [[city]]; both trusted more in castruccio than in the florentines, because they believed that castruccio was far more ready and willing to [[fight]] than the florentines, and they both sent to him for assistance. he gave promises to both, saying to bastiano that he would come in [[person]], and to jacopo that he would send his pupil, pagolo guinigi. at the appointed [[time]] he sent forward pagolo by way of pisa, and went himself direct to pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the [[city]], and both were admitted as [[friends]]. thus the two leaders entered, and at a signal given by castruccio, one killed jacopo da gia, and the other bastiano di possente, and both took prisoners [[prisoner]] or killed the partisans of either faction. without further opposition pistoia passed into the hands of castruccio, who, having forced the signoria to leave the palace, compelled the [[people]] to yield [[obedience]] to him, making them many promises and remitting their old debts. the countryside flocked to the [[city]] to see the new [[prince]], and all were filled with [[hope]] and quickly settled down, influenced in a [[great]] measure by his [[great]] valour.
about this [[time]] [[great]] disturbances arose in [[rome]], owing to the dearness of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at avignon. the [[german]] governor, enrico, was much blamed for what happened—murders and tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put an end to them. this caused enrico much [[anxiety]] lest the romans should call in ruberto, the [[king]] of naples, who would drive the germans out of the [[city]], and bring back the [[pope]]. having no nearer friend to whom he could apply for [[help]] than castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not only to give him assistance, but also to come in [[person]] to [[rome]]. castruccio considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the [[emperor]] this service, because he believed that he himself would not be safe if at any [[time]] the [[emperor]] ceased to hold [[rome]]. leaving pagolo guinigi in command at lucca, castruccio set out for [[rome]] with six hundred horsemen, where he was received by enrico with the [[greatest]] distinction. in a short [[time]] the presence of castruccio obtained such [[respect]] for the [[emperor]] that, without bloodshed or [[violence]], [[good]] order was restored, chiefly by [[reason]] of castruccio having sent by sea from the [[country]] round pisa large quantities of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble. when he had chastised some of the roman leaders, and admonished others, voluntary [[obedience]] was rendered to enrico. castruccio received many honours [[honour]], and was made a roman senator. this [[dignity]] was assumed with the [[greatest]] pomp, castruccio being clothed in a brocaded toga, which had the following words embroidered on its front: “i am what [[god]] wills.” whilst on the back was: “what [[god]] desires [[desire]] shall be.”
during this [[time]] the florentines, who were much enraged that castruccio should have seized pistoia during the truce, considered how they could tempt the [[city]] to rebel, to do which they [[thought]] would not be difficult in his absence. among the exiled pistoians in florence were baldo cecchi and jacopo baldini, both [[men]] of leading and ready to face danger. these [[men]] kept up communications with their [[friends]] in pistoia, and with the aid of the florentines entered the [[city]] by night, and after driving out some of castruccio’s officials and partisans, and killing others, they restored the [[city]] to its [[freedom]]. the news of this greatly angered castruccio, and taking leave of enrico, he pressed on in [[great]] haste to pistoia. when the florentines heard of his return, knowing that he would lose no [[time]], they decided to intercept him with their forces [[force]] in the val di nievole, under the [[belief]] that by doing so they would cut off his road to pistoia. assembling a [[great]] [[army]] of the supporters of the guelph cause, the florentines entered the pistoian territories. on the other hand, castruccio reached montecarlo with his [[army]]; and having heard where the florentines’ lay, he decided not to encounter it in the plains of pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of pescia, but, as far as he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the pass of serravalle. he believed that if he succeeded in this design, [[victory]] was assured, although he was informed that the florentines had thirty thousand [[men]], whilst he had only twelve thousand. although he had every confidence in his own abilities and the valour of his [[troops]], yet he hesitated to attack his [[enemy]] in the open lest he should be overwhelmed by numbers. serravalle is a castle between pescia and pistoia, situated on a hill which blocks the val di nievole, not in the exact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places narrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently, but is still narrow, especially at the summit where the waters divide, so that twenty [[men]] side by side could hold it. the [[lord]] of serravalle was manfred, a [[german]], who, before castruccio became [[lord]] of pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of the castle, it being [[common]] to the lucchese and the pistoians, and unclaimed by either—neither of them wishing to displace manfred as long as he kept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations to no one. for these reasons [[reason]], and also because the castle was well fortified, he had always been able to maintain his position. it was here that castruccio had determined to fall upon his [[enemy]], for here his few [[men]] would have the advantage, and there was no [[fear]] lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile [[force]] before they became engaged, they should not stand. as soon as this trouble with florence arose, castruccio saw the immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate [[friendship]] with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so with him that four hundred of his [[men]] were to be admitted into the castle the night before the attack on the florentines, and the castellan put to [[death]].
castruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the florentines to persist in their [[desire]] to carry the seat of [[war]] away from pistoia into the val di nievole, therefore he did not move his [[army]] from montecarlo. thus the florentines hurried on until they reached their encampment under serravalle, intending to cross the hill on the following morning. in the meantime, castruccio had seized the castle at night, had also moved his [[army]] from montecarlo, and marching from thence at midnight in [[dead]] [[silence]], had reached the foot of serravalle: thus he and the florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same [[time]] in the morning. castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the castle. the florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of their [[army]] which was following, never expecting to find castruccio in possession of the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized the castle. thus it happened that the florentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry of castruccio, and so close were they upon it they had scarcely [[time]] to pull down their visors. it was a case of unready soldiers being attacked by ready, and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own, although some few of them got through. when the noise of the fighting reached the florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion. the cavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were unable to get their [[men]] either backward or forward, owing to the narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought to be done or what could be done. in a short [[time]] the cavalry who were engaged with the enemy’s infantry were scattered or killed without having made any effective defence because of their unfortunate position, although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout [[resistance]]. retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on both flanks, whilst in front were their enemies [[enemy]], and in the rear their [[friends]]. when castruccio saw that his [[men]] were unable to strike a decisive blow at the [[enemy]] and put them to flight, he sent one thousand infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole [[force]] to fall upon the flank of the [[enemy]]. these orders they carried out with such fury that the florentines could not sustain the attack, but gave way, and were soon in full retreat—conquered more by their unfortunate position than by the valour of their [[enemy]]. those in the rear turned towards pistoia, and spread through the plains, each [[man]] seeking only his own safety. the defeat was complete and very sanguinary. many captains were taken prisoners [[prisoner]], among whom were bandini dei rossi, francesco brunelleschi, and giovanni della tosa, all florentine noblemen, with many tuscans and neapolitans who fought on the florentine side, having been sent by [[king]] ruberto to assist the guelphs. immediately the pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out the [[friends]] of the guelphs, and surrendered to castruccio. he was not content with occupying prato and all the castles on the plains on both sides of the arno, but marched his [[army]] into the plain of peretola, about two miles from florence. here he remained many days, dividing the spoils, and celebrating his [[victory]] with feasts and games, holding horse races [[race]], and foot races [[race]] for [[men]] and [[women]]. he also struck medals in commemoration of the defeat of the florentines. he endeavoured to [[corrupt]] some of the [[citizens]] of florence, who were to open the [[city]] gates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the participators in it taken and beheaded, among whom were tommaso lupacci and lambertuccio frescobaldi. this defeat caused the florentines [[great]] [[anxiety]], and despairing of preserving their [[liberty]], they sent envoys to [[king]] ruberto of naples, offering him the dominion of their [[city]]; and he, knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the guelph cause was to him, accepted it. he agreed with the florentines to receive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and he sent his [[son]] carlo to florence with four thousand horsemen.
shortly after this the florentines were relieved in some [[degree]] of the pressure of castruccio’s [[army]], owing to his being compelled to leave his positions before florence and march on pisa, in order to suppress a conspiracy that had been raised against him by benedetto lanfranchi, one of the first [[men]] in pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland should be under the dominion of the lucchese. he had formed this conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of castruccio, and drive out the garrison. as, however, in a conspiracy paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few are not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy lanfranchi encountered a [[person]] who revealed the design to castruccio. this betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to bonifacio cerchi and giovanni guidi, two florentine exiles who were suffering their [[banishment]] in pisa. thereupon castruccio seized benedetto and put him to [[death]], and beheaded many other [[noble]] [[citizens]], and drove their families [[family]] into [[exile]]. it now appeared to castruccio that both pisa and pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much [[thought]] and energy upon securing his position there, and this gave the florentines their opportunity to reorganize their [[army]], and to await the coming of carlo, the [[son]] of the [[king]] of naples. when carlo arrived they decided to lose no more [[time]], and assembled a [[great]] [[army]] of more than thirty thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry—having called to their aid every guelph there was in [[italy]]. they consulted whether they should attack pistoia or pisa first, and decided that it would be [[better]] to march on the latter—a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more likely to succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed that the [[surrender]] of pistoia would [[follow]] the acquisition of pisa.
in the early part of may 1328, the florentines put in motion this [[army]] and quickly occupied lastra, signa, montelupo, and empoli, passing from thence on to san miniato. when castruccio heard of the enormous [[army]] which the florentines were sending against him, he was in no [[degree]] alarmed, believing that the [[time]] had now arrived when [[fortune]] would deliver the [[empire]] of tuscany into his hands, for he had no [[reason]] to [[think]] that his [[enemy]] would make a [[better]] [[fight]], or had [[better]] prospects of [[success]], than at pisa or serravalle. he assembled twenty thousand foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this [[army]] went to fucecchio, whilst he sent pagolo guinigi to pisa with five thousand infantry. fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers arno and gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain. moreover, the [[enemy]] could not hinder its being victualled unless they divided their forces [[force]], nor could they approach it either from the direction of lucca or pisa, nor could they get through to pisa, or attack castruccio’s forces [[force]] except at a disadvantage. in one case they would find themselves placed between his two armies [[army]], the one under his own command and the other under pagolo, and in the other case they would have to cross the arno to get to close quarters with the [[enemy]], an undertaking of [[great]] hazard. in order to tempt the florentines to take this latter course, castruccio withdrew his [[men]] from the banks of the river and placed them under the walls of fucecchio, leaving a wide expanse of [[land]] between them and the river.
the florentines, having occupied san miniato, held a council of [[war]] to decide whether they should attack pisa or the [[army]] of castruccio, and, having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the latter. the river arno was at that [[time]] low enough to be fordable, yet the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the saddles of the horsemen. on the morning of 10 june 1328, the florentines commenced the [[battle]] by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten thousand infantry. castruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, and who well knew what to do, at once attacked the florentines with five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them to issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one thousand [[light]] infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the arno. the infantry of the florentines were so much impeded by their arms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the river, whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more difficult for the others, by [[reason]] of the few who had crossed having broken up the bed of the river, and this being deep with mud, many of the horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could not move. when the florentine captains saw the difficulties their [[men]] were meeting, they withdrew them and moved higher up the river, hoping to find the river bed less [[treacherous]] and the banks more adapted for landing. these [[men]] were met at the bank by the forces [[force]] which castruccio had already sent forward, who, being [[light]] armed with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with tremendous shouts into the faces and bodies [[body]] of the cavalry. the horses, alarmed by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and trampled each other in [[great]] confusion. the [[fight]] between the [[men]] of castruccio and those of the [[enemy]] who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield. the soldiers of castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river, whilst the florentines strove to get a footing on [[land]] in order to make room for the others pressing forward, who if they could but get out of the water would be able to [[fight]], and in this obstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains. castruccio shouted to his [[men]] that these were the same enemies [[enemy]] whom they had before conquered at serravalle, whilst the florentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome by the few. at length castruccio, seeing how long the [[battle]] had lasted, and that both his [[men]] and the [[enemy]] were utterly exhausted, and that both sides had many killed and wounded, pushed forward another [[body]] of infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who were fighting; he then commanded these latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat, and one part of them to turn to the [[right]] and another to the left. this cleared a space of which the florentines at once took advantage, and thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield. but when these tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with castruccio’s reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into the river. the cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any decisive advantage over the other, because castruccio, knowing his inferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the defensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short [[work]] of the cavalry. this fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the florentine [[army]] driven back across the river he ordered the remainder of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the [[enemy]]. this they did with lance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the [[enemy]] with the [[greatest]] fury and soon put him to flight. the florentine captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower down the river, in order to attack the flanks of castruccio’s [[army]]. but here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the [[men]] of castruccio, and this movement was quite useless. thus the florentines were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them escaped, and castruccio was again covered with [[glory]]. many captains were taken prisoners [[prisoner]], and carlo, the [[son]] of [[king]] ruberto, with michelagnolo falconi and taddeo degli albizzi, the florentine commissioners, fled to empoli. if the spoils were [[great]], the slaughter was infinitely greater, as might be expected in such a [[battle]]. of the florentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one [[men]], whilst castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy [[men]].
but [[fortune]] growing envious of the [[glory]] of castruccio took away his [[life]] just at the [[time]] when she should have preserved it, and thus ruined all those plans which for so long a [[time]] he had worked to carry into effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but [[death]] could have stopped him. castruccio was in the thick of the [[battle]] the whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued and overheated, he stood at the gate of fucecchio to welcome his [[men]] on their return from [[victory]] and personally thank them. he was also on the watch for any attempt of the [[enemy]] to retrieve the fortunes [[fortune]] of the day; he being of the [[opinion]] that it was the [[duty]] of a [[good]] general to be the first [[man]] in the saddle and the [[last]] out of it. here castruccio stood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the arno, and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of which he [[thought]] nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it was the cause of his [[death]]. on the following night he was attacked with high fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must prove fatal. castruccio, therefore, called pagolo guinigi to him, and addressed him as follows:
“if i could have believed that [[fortune]] would have cut me off in the midst of the [[career]] which was leading to that [[glory]] which all my successes promised, i should have laboured less, and i should have left thee, if a smaller [[state]], at least with fewer enemies [[enemy]] and perils, because i should have been content with the governorships of lucca and pisa. i should neither have subjugated the pistoians, nor outraged the florentines with so many injuries. but i would have made both these peoples [[people]] my [[friends]], and i should have lived, if no longer, at least more peacefully, and have left you a [[state]] without a [[doubt]] smaller, but one more secure and established on a surer foundation. but [[fortune]], who insists upon having the arbitrament of [[human]] affairs, did not endow me with sufficient [[judgment]] to recognize this from the first, nor the [[time]] to surmount it. thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and i have never concealed it, how i entered the house of thy [[father]] whilst yet a boy—a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous [[soul]] should feel—and how i was brought up by him, and loved as though i had been born of his [[blood]]; how under his governance i learned to be valiant and capable of availing myself of all that [[fortune]], of which thou hast been witness. when thy [[good]] [[father]] came to [[die]], he committed thee and all his possessions to my [[care]], and i have brought thee up with that [[love]], and increased thy estate with that [[care]], which i was bound to show. and in order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy [[father]] left, but also that which my [[fortune]] and abilities have gained, i have never [[married]], so that the [[love]] of [[children]] should never deflect my [[mind]] from that gratitude which i owed to the [[children]] of thy [[father]]. thus i leave thee a vast estate, of which i am well content, but i am deeply concerned, inasmuch as i leave it thee unsettled and insecure. thou hast the [[city]] of lucca on thy hands, which will never rest contented under thy [[government]]. thou hast also pisa, where the [[men]] are of [[nature]] changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be sometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under a lucchese. pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with factions and deeply incensed against thy [[family]] by [[reason]] of the wrongs [[wrong]] recently inflicted upon them. thou hast for neighbours the offended florentines, injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly destroyed, who will hail the news of my [[death]] with more delight than they would the acquisition of all tuscany. in the [[emperor]] and in the princes [[prince]] of milan thou canst place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and their [[help]] is very long in coming. therefore, thou hast no [[hope]] in anything but in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and in the prestige which this latest [[victory]] has brought thee; which, as thou knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee to come to terms with the florentines, who, as they are suffering under this [[great]] defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. and whereas i have sought to make them my enemies [[enemy]], because i believed that [[war]] with them would conduce to my [[power]] and [[glory]], thou hast every inducement to make [[friends]] of them, because their [[alliance]] will bring thee advantages and security. it is of the [[greatest]] important in this [[world]] that a [[man]] should [[know]] himself, and the measure of his own [[strength]] and means; and he who knows [[know]] that he has not a genius for fighting must learn how to govern by the [[arts]] of [[peace]]. and it will be well for thee to [[rule]] thy conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this way to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained; and in this thou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to [[believe]] that what i have told thee is true. and thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that i have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it.”
after this there came to castruccio those [[citizens]] of pisa, pistoia, and lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending pagolo to them, and making them swear [[obedience]] to him as his successor, he died. he left a [[happy]] memory to those who had known him, and no [[prince]] of those times [[time]] was ever loved with such devotion as he was. his obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he was buried in san francesco at lucca. [[fortune]] was not so friendly to pagolo guinigi as she had been to castruccio, for he had not the abilities. not long after the [[death]] of castruccio, pagolo lost pisa, and then pistoia, and only with difficulty held on to lucca. this latter [[city]] continued in the [[family]] of guinigi until the [[time]] of the great-grandson of pagolo.
from what has been related here it will be seen that castruccio was a [[man]] of exceptional abilities, not only measured by [[men]] of his own [[time]], but also by those of an earlier date. in stature he was above the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. he was of a gracious presence, and he welcomed [[men]] with such urbanity that those who spoke with him rarely left him displeased. his hair was inclined to be red, and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or snowed, he always went without a hat. he was delightful among [[friends]], but terrible to his enemies [[enemy]]; just to his subjects [[subject]]; ready to play false with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he [[desired]] to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the [[victory]] that brought the [[glory]], not the methods of achieving it. no one was bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. he was accustomed to say that [[men]] ought to attempt everything and [[fear]] nothing; that [[god]] is a lover of [[strong]] [[men]], because one always sees that the [[weak]] are chastised by the [[strong]]. he was also wonderfully sharp or biting though courteous in his answers [[answer]]; and as he did not look for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angered with others did not show it to him. it has often happened that he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the following occasions [[occasion]]. he had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom castruccio had said: “you would not have given more than a penny.” “that is true,” answered the friend. then said castruccio to him: “a ducat is much less to me.” having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: “fisherman are willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they may take a few little fishes, and i allow myself to be wetted by spittle that i may catch a whale”; and this was not only heard by castruccio with patience but rewarded. when told by a [[priest]] that it was wicked for him to [[live]] so sumptuously, castruccio said: “if that be a [[vice]] then you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints.” passing through a street he saw a [[young]] [[man]] as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at being seen by castruccio, and said to him: “thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places.” a friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: “fool, do you [[think]] that i [[wish]] to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to fasten.” castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: “you are like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the [[best]] to [[eat]],” and was answered: “we are rather like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the [[greatest]] need of them.” going by water from pisa to leghorn, castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for cowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not [[fear]] anything. castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since every [[man]] valued his [[soul]] for what is was worth. being [[asked]] by one what he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: “when thou goest to a banquet take [[care]] that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon another.” to a [[person]] who was boasting that he had [[read]] many things, castruccio said: “he knows [[know]] [[better]] than to boast of remembering many things.” someone bragged that he could drink much without becoming intoxicated. castruccio replied: “an ox does the same.” castruccio was acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being blamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be taken in by a woman, he said: “she has not taken me in, i have taken her.” being also blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered: “thou dost not spend as much as i do?” and being told that it was true, he continued: “then thou art [[arts]] more avaricious than i am gluttonous.” being invited by taddeo bernardi, a very [[rich]] and splendid citizen of luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown by taddeo into a chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring. castruccio gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon taddeo, and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: “i knew not where to spit in order to offend thee less.” being [[asked]] how caesar died he said: “god willing i will [[die]] as he did.” being one night in the house of one of his gentlemen where many ladies [[lady]] were assembled, he was reproved by one of his [[friends]] for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was usual in one of his station, so he said: “he who is considered [[wise]] by day will not be considered a [[fool]] at night.” a [[person]] came to demand a favour of castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by castruccio, said: “thou art [[arts]] the [[reason]] of my acting thus for thou hast thy ears in thy feet,” whereupon he obtained double the favour he had [[asked]]. castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled blindfolded. being [[asked]] a favour by one who used many superfluous words, he said to him: “when you have another request to make, send someone else to make it.” having been wearied by a similar [[man]] with a long oration who wound up by saying: “perhaps i have fatigued you by speaking so long,” castruccio said: “you have not, because i have not listened to a word you said.” he used to say of one who had been a beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine [[man]], that he was dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives [[wife]] and now he took the wives [[wife]] from their husbands. to an envious [[man]] who laughed, he said: “do you laugh because you are successful or because another is unfortunate?” whilst he was still in the charge of messer francesco guinigi, one of his companions said to him: “what shall i give you if you will let me give you a blow on the nose?” castruccio answered: “a helmet.” having put to [[death]] a citizen of lucca who had been instrumental in raising him to [[power]], and being told that he had done [[wrong]] to kill one of his old [[friends]], he answered that [[people]] deceived themselves; he had only killed a new [[enemy]]. castruccio praised greatly those [[men]] who intended to take a [[wife]] and then did not do so, saying that they were like [[men]] who said they would go to sea, and then refused when the [[time]] came. he said that it always struck him with surprise that whilst [[men]] in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first to learn if it were [[good]], yet in choosing a [[wife]] they were content with only looking at her. he was once [[asked]] in what manner he would [[wish]] to be buried when he died, and answered: “with the face turned downwards, for i [[know]] when i am gone this [[country]] will be turned upside down.” on being [[asked]] if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order to save his [[soul]], he answered that it had not, because it appeared [[strange]] to him that fra lazerone should go to paradise and uguccione della faggiuola to the inferno. he was once [[asked]] when should a [[man]] [[eat]] to preserve his health, and replied: “if the [[man]] be [[rich]] let him [[eat]] when he is hungry; if he be [[poor]], then when he can.” seeing one of his gentlemen make a member of his [[family]] lace him up, he said to him: “i [[pray]] [[god]] that you will let him feed you also.” seeing that someone had written upon his house in latin the words: “may [[god]] preserve this house from the wicked,” he said, “the owner must never go in.” passing through one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door, and remarked: “that house will fly through the door.” he was having a discussion with the ambassador of the [[king]] of naples concerning the [[property]] of some [[banished]] nobles [[noble]], when a dispute arose between them, and the ambassador [[asked]] him if he had no [[fear]] of the [[king]]. “is this [[king]] of yours a [[bad]] [[man]] or a [[good]] one?” [[asked]] castruccio, and was told that he was a [[good]] one, whereupon he said, “why should you suggest that i should be afraid of a [[good]] [[man]]?”
i could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and weighty, but i [[think]] that the above will be sufficient testimony to his high qualities. he lived forty-four years, and was in every way a [[prince]]. and as he was surrounded by many evidences of his [[good]] [[fortune]], so he also [[desired]] to have near him some memorials of his [[bad]] [[fortune]]; therefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be seen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they were placed by him to testify forever to his days of adversity. as in his [[life]] he was inferior neither to philip of macedon, the [[father]] of alexander, nor to scipio of [[rome]], so he died in the same year of his [[age]] as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had [[fortune]] decreed that he should be born, not in lucca, but in macedonia or [[rome]].
