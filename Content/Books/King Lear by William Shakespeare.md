act i

scene i. a room of [[state]] in [[king]] lear’s palace.

 enter kent, gloucester and edmund.

kent.
i [[thought]] the [[king]] had more affected the duke of albany than cornwall.

gloucester.
it did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the [[kingdom]],
it appears not which of the dukes he values most, for qualities are so
weighed that curiosity in neither can make [[choice]] of either’s moiety.

kent.
is not this your [[son]], my [[lord]]?

gloucester.
his breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: i have so often
blush’d to acknowledge him that now i am braz’d to’t.

kent.
i cannot conceive you.

gloucester.
sir, this [[young]] fellow’s [[mother]] could; whereupon she grew
round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a [[son]] for her cradle ere she
had a husband for her bed. do you smell a [[fault]]?

kent.
i cannot [[wish]] the [[fault]] undone, the issue of it being so proper.

gloucester.
but i have a [[son]], sir, by order of [[law]], some year elder than
this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came
something saucily to the [[world]] before he was sent for, yet was
his [[mother]] [[fair]]; there was [[good]] [[sport]] at his making, and the
whoreson must be acknowledged. do you [[know]] this [[noble]] gentleman,
edmund?

edmund.
no, my [[lord]].

gloucester.
my [[lord]] of kent: [[remember]] him hereafter as my honourable friend.

edmund.
my services to your lordship.

kent.
i must [[love]] you, and sue to [[know]] you [[better]].

edmund.
sir, i shall study deserving.

gloucester.
he hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. the king
is coming.

 [_sennet within._]

 enter lear, cornwall, albany, goneril, regan, cordelia and attendants.

lear.
attend the lords [[lord]] of [[france]] and burgundy,
gloucester.

gloucester.
i shall, my [[lord]].

 [_exeunt gloucester and edmund._]

lear.
meantime we shall express our darker [[purpose]].
give me the map there. [[know]] that we have divided
in three our [[kingdom]]: and ’tis our fast intent
to shake all cares [[care]] and [[business]] from our [[age]];
conferring them on younger strengths, while we
unburden’d crawl toward [[death]]. our [[son]] of cornwall,
and you, our no less loving [[son]] of albany,
we have this hour a constant will to publish
our daughters’ several dowers, that future strife
may be prevented now. the princes [[prince]], [[france]] and burgundy,
great rivals in our youngest daughter’s [[love]],
long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
and here are to be answer’d. tell me, my daughters [[daughter]],—
since now we will divest us both of [[rule]],
interest of territory, cares [[care]] of [[state]],—
which of you shall we say doth [[love]] us most?
that we our largest bounty may extend
where [[nature]] doth with [[merit]] challenge.—goneril,
our eldest born, speak first.

goneril.
sir, i [[love]] you more than word can wield the matter;
dearer than eyesight, space, and [[liberty]];
beyond what can be valu’d, [[rich]] or rare;
no less than [[life]], with grace, health, [[beauty]], [[honour]];
as much as child e’er lov’d, or [[father]] found;
a [[love]] that makes breath [[poor]] and [[speech]] unable;
beyond all manner of so much i [[love]] you.

cordelia.
[_aside._] what shall cordelia speak? [[love]], and be silent.

lear.
of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
with shadowy forests and with champains rich’d,
with plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
we make thee [[lady]]: to thine and albany’s issue
be this perpetual.—what says our second [[daughter]],
our dearest regan, [[wife]] of cornwall? speak.

regan.
sir, i am made of the [[self]] mettle as my sister,
and prize me at her worth. in my true heart
i find she names my very deed of [[love]];
only she comes too short, that i profess
myself an [[enemy]] to all other joys
which the most precious square of sense possesses,
and find i am alone felicitate
in your dear highness’ [[love]].

cordelia.
[_aside._] then [[poor]] cordelia,
and yet not so; since, i am sure, my love’s
more ponderous than my tongue.

lear.
to thee and thine hereditary ever
remain this ample third of our [[fair]] [[kingdom]];
no less in space, validity, and pleasure
than that conferr’d on goneril.—now, our joy,
although the [[last]] and least; to whose [[young]] love
the vines of [[france]] and milk of burgundy
strive to be interess’d; what can you say to draw
a third more opulent than your sisters? speak.

cordelia.
nothing, my [[lord]].

lear.
nothing?

cordelia.
nothing.

lear.
nothing will come of nothing: speak again.

cordelia.
unhappy that i am, i cannot heave
my [[heart]] into my mouth: i [[love]] your majesty
according to my bond; no more nor less.

lear.
how, how, cordelia? mend your [[speech]] a little,
lest you may mar your fortunes [[fortune]].

cordelia.
good my [[lord]],
you have begot me, bred me, lov’d me: i
return those duties [[duty]] back as are [[right]] fit,
obey you, [[love]] you, and most [[honour]] you.
why have my sisters husbands if they say
they [[love]] you all? haply, when i shall wed,
that [[lord]] whose hand must take my plight shall carry
half my [[love]] with him, half my [[care]] and [[duty]]:
sure i shall never [[marry]] like my sisters,
to [[love]] my [[father]] all.

lear.
but goes thy [[heart]] with this?

cordelia.
ay, my [[good]] [[lord]].

lear.
so [[young]], and so untender?

cordelia.
so [[young]], my [[lord]], and true.

lear.
let it be so, thy [[truth]] then be thy dower:
for, by the [[sacred]] radiance of the sun,
the mysteries of hecate and the night;
by all the operation of the orbs,
from whom we do [[exist]] and cease to be;
here i disclaim all my paternal [[care]],
propinquity and [[property]] of [[blood]],
and as a stranger to my [[heart]] and me
hold thee from this for ever. the barbarous scythian,
or he that makes his [[generation]] messes
to gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
be as well neighbour’d, pitied, and reliev’d,
as thou my sometime [[daughter]].

kent.
good my liege,—

lear.
peace, kent!
come not between the dragon and his wrath.
i lov’d her most, and [[thought]] to set my rest
on her [[kind]] nursery. [_to cordelia._] hence and avoid my sight!
so be my grave my [[peace]], as here i give
her father’s [[heart]] from her! call [[france]]. who stirs?
call burgundy! cornwall and albany,
with my two daughters’ dowers digest this third:
let [[pride]], which she calls plainness, [[marry]] her.
i do invest you jointly with my [[power]],
pre-eminence, and all the large effects
that troop with majesty. ourself, by monthly course,
with reservation of an hundred knights,
by you to be sustain’d, shall our abode
make with you by due turn. only we shall retain
the name, and all the addition to a [[king]]; the sway,
revenue, execution of the rest,
beloved sons [[son]], be yours; which to confirm,
this coronet part between you.
 [_giving the [[crown]]._]

kent.
royal lear,
whom i have ever honour’d as my [[king]],
lov’d as my [[father]], as my master follow’d,
as my [[great]] patron [[thought]] on in my prayers.—

lear.
the bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.

kent.
let it fall rather, though the fork invade
the region of my [[heart]]: be kent unmannerly
when lear is mad. what wouldst thou do, old [[man]]?
think’st thou that [[duty]] shall have dread to speak,
when [[power]] to [[flattery]] bows? to plainness honour’s bound
when majesty falls to folly. reverse thy [[state]];
and in thy [[best]] consideration check
this hideous rashness: [[answer]] my [[life]] my judgement,
thy youngest [[daughter]] does not [[love]] thee least;
nor are those empty-hearted, whose low sounds
reverb no hollowness.

lear.
kent, on thy [[life]], no more.

kent.
my [[life]] i never held but as a pawn
to wage against thine enemies [[enemy]]; ne’er [[fear]] to lose it,
thy safety being the motive.

lear.
out of my sight!

kent.
see [[better]], lear; and let me still remain
the true blank of thine eye.

lear.
now, by [[apollo]],—

kent.
now by [[apollo]], [[king]],
thou swear’st thy gods in [[vain]].

lear.
o vassal! miscreant!

 [_laying his hand on his [[sword]]._]

albany and cornwall.
dear sir, forbear!

kent.
kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
upon the foul disease. revoke thy gift,
or, whilst i can vent clamour from my throat,
i’ll tell thee thou dost [[evil]].

lear.
hear me, recreant! on thine allegiance, hear me!
since thou hast sought to make us break our vows,
which we durst never yet, and with strain’d pride
to come betwixt our sentences and our [[power]],
which nor our [[nature]], nor our place can bear,
our potency made [[good]], take thy [[reward]].
five days we do allot thee for provision,
to shield thee from disasters of the [[world]];
and on the sixth to turn thy hated back
upon our [[kingdom]]: if, on the next day following,
thy banish’d trunk be found in our dominions,
the moment is thy [[death]]. away! by [[jupiter]],
this shall not be revok’d.

kent.
fare thee well, [[king]]: sith thus thou wilt appear,
freedom lives [[life]] hence, and [[banishment]] is here.
[_to cordelia._] the gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
that justly think’st and hast most rightly said!
[_to goneril and regan._] and your large speeches [[speech]] may your deeds
approve,
that [[good]] effects may spring from words of [[love]].
thus kent, o princes [[prince]], bids you all adieu;
he’ll shape his old course in a [[country]] new.

 [_exit._]

 flourish. re-enter gloucester, with [[france]], burgundy and attendants.

cordelia.
here’s [[france]] and burgundy, my [[noble]] [[lord]].

lear.
my [[lord]] of burgundy,
we first address toward you, who with this king
hath rivall’d for our [[daughter]]: what in the least
will you require in [[present]] dower with her,
or cease your quest of [[love]]?

burgundy.
most [[royal]] majesty,
i crave no more than hath your highness offer’d,
nor will you tender less?

lear.
right [[noble]] burgundy,
when she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
but now her price is fall’n. sir, there she stands:
if aught within that little-seeming substance,
or all of it, with our displeasure piec’d,
and nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
she’s there, and she is yours.

burgundy.
i [[know]] no [[answer]].

lear.
will you, with those infirmities she owes,
unfriended, new adopted to our hate,
dower’d with our curse, and stranger’d with our oath,
take her or leave her?

burgundy.
pardon me, [[royal]] sir;
election makes not up in such conditions.

lear.
then leave her, sir; for, by the [[power]] that made me,
i tell you all her [[wealth]]. [_to france_] for you, [[great]] [[king]],
i would not from your [[love]] make such a stray
to match you where i hate; therefore beseech you
t’avert your liking a more worthier way
than on a wretch whom [[nature]] is asham’d
almost t’acknowledge hers.

france.
this is most [[strange]],
that she, who even but now was your [[best]] object,
the argument of your [[praise]], balm of your [[age]],
the [[best]], the dearest, should in this trice of time
commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
so many folds of favour. sure her offence
must be of such unnatural degree
that monsters it, or your fore-vouch’d affection
fall into taint; which to [[believe]] of her
must be a [[faith]] that [[reason]] without miracle
should never plant in me.

cordelia.
i yet beseech your majesty,
if for i want that glib and oily art
to speak and [[purpose]] not; since what i well intend,
i’ll do’t before i speak,—that you make known
it is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
no unchaste action or dishonour’d step,
that hath depriv’d me of your grace and favour;
but even for want of that for which i am richer,
a still soliciting eye, and such a tongue
as i am glad i have not, though not to have it
hath lost me in your liking.

lear.
better thou hadst
not been born than not to have pleas’d me [[better]].

france.
is it but this?—a tardiness in nature
which often leaves the [[history]] unspoke
that it intends to do? my [[lord]] of burgundy,
what say you to the [[lady]]? love’s not love
when it is mingled with regards that stands
aloof from the entire point. will you have her?
she is herself a dowry.

burgundy.
royal [[king]],
give but that portion which yourself propos’d,
and here i take cordelia by the hand,
duchess of burgundy.

lear.
nothing: i have sworn; i am firm.

burgundy.
i am [[sorry]], then, you have so lost a father
that you must lose a husband.

cordelia.
peace be with burgundy!
since that respects [[respect]] of fortunes [[fortune]] are his [[love]],
i shall not be his [[wife]].

france.
fairest cordelia, that art [[arts]] most [[rich]], being [[poor]];
most [[choice]] forsaken; and most lov’d, despis’d!
thee and thy virtues [[virtue]] here i seize upon:
be it lawful, i take up what’s cast away.
gods, gods! ’tis [[strange]] that from their cold’st neglect
my [[love]] should kindle to inflam’d [[respect]].
thy dowerless [[daughter]], [[king]], thrown to my [[chance]],
is queen of us, of ours, and our [[fair]] [[france]]:
not all the dukes of waterish burgundy
can buy this unpriz’d precious maid of me.
bid them farewell, cordelia, though unkind:
thou losest here, a [[better]] where to find.

lear.
thou hast her, [[france]]: let her be thine; for we
have no such [[daughter]], nor shall ever see
that face of hers again. therefore be gone
without our grace, our [[love]], our benison.
come, [[noble]] burgundy.

 [_flourish. exeunt lear, burgundy, cornwall, albany, gloucester and
 attendants._]

france.
bid farewell to your sisters.

cordelia.
the jewels of our [[father]], with wash’d eyes
cordelia leaves you: i [[know]] you what you are;
and like a sister am most loath to call
your faults [[fault]] as they are nam’d. [[love]] well our [[father]]:
to your professed bosoms i commit him:
but yet, alas, stood i within his grace,
i would prefer him to a [[better]] place.
so farewell to you both.

regan.
prescribe not us our duties [[duty]].

goneril.
let your study
be to content your [[lord]], who hath receiv’d you
at fortune’s alms. you have [[obedience]] scanted,
and well are worth the want that you have wanted.

cordelia.
time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides:
who covers faults [[fault]], at [[last]] shame derides.
well may you [[prosper]].

france.
come, my [[fair]] cordelia.

 [_exeunt [[france]] and cordelia._]

goneril.
sister, it is not little i have to say of what most nearly
appertains to us both. i [[think]] our [[father]] will hence tonight.

regan.
that’s most [[certain]], and with you; next month with us.

goneril.
you see how full of changes [[change]] his [[age]] is; the observation we
have made of it hath not been little: he always loved our
sister most; and with what [[poor]] judgement he hath now cast her
off appears too grossly.

regan.
’tis the infirmity of his [[age]]: yet he hath ever but slenderly
known himself.

goneril.
the [[best]] and soundest of his [[time]] hath been but rash; then must
we look from his [[age]] to receive not alone the imperfections of
long-engrafted condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
that infirm and choleric years bring with them.

regan.
such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of kent’s
banishment.

goneril.
there is further compliment of leave-taking between [[france]] and
him. [[pray]] you let us hit together: if our [[father]] carry authority
with such disposition as he bears, this [[last]] [[surrender]] of his
will but offend us.

regan.
we shall further [[think]] of it.

goneril.
we must do something, and i’ th’ heat.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. a hall in the earl of gloucester’s castle.

 enter edmund with a
letter.

edmund.
thou, [[nature]], art [[arts]] my [[goddess]]; to thy law
my services are bound. wherefore should i
stand in the plague of custom, and permit
the curiosity of nations to deprive me?
for that i am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
lag of a [[brother]]? why bastard? wherefore base?
when my dimensions are as well compact,
my [[mind]] as generous, and my shape as true
as honest madam’s issue? why brand they us
with base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
who, in the lusty stealth of [[nature]], take
more composition and fierce quality
than doth within a dull stale tired bed
go to the creating a whole tribe of fops
got ’tween asleep and wake? well then,
legitimate edgar, i must have your [[land]]:
our father’s [[love]] is to the bastard edmund
as to the legitimate: fine word: legitimate!
well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
and my invention thrive, edmund the base
shall top the legitimate. i grow, i [[prosper]].
now, gods, stand up for bastards!

 enter gloucester.

gloucester.
kent banish’d thus! and [[france]] in choler parted!
and the [[king]] gone tonight! prescrib’d his pow’r!
confin’d to exhibition! all this done
upon the gad!—edmund, how now! what news?

edmund.
so please your lordship, none.

 [_putting up the letter._]

gloucester.
why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?

edmund.
i [[know]] no news, my [[lord]].

gloucester.
what paper were you reading?

edmund.
nothing, my [[lord]].

gloucester.
no? what needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? the
quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. let’s see. come,
if it be nothing, i shall not need spectacles.

edmund.
i beseech you, sir, pardon me. it is a letter from my [[brother]] that i
have not all o’er-read; and for so much as i have perus’d, i find it
not fit for your o’er-looking.

gloucester.
give me the letter, sir.

edmund.
i shall offend, either to detain or give it. the contents, as in
part i [[understand]] them, are to blame.

gloucester.
let’s see, let’s see!

edmund.
i [[hope]], for my brother’s justification, he wrote this but as an
essay, or taste of my [[virtue]].

gloucester.
[_reads._] ‘this policy and reverence of [[age]] makes the world
bitter to the [[best]] of our times [[time]]; keeps our fortunes [[fortune]] from us
till our oldness cannot relish them. i begin to find an idle
and fond bondage in the oppression of aged [[tyranny]]; who sways
not as it hath [[power]], but as it is [[suffered]]. come to me, that
of this i may speak more. if our [[father]] would sleep till i
waked him, you should enjoy half his [[revenue]] for ever, and live
the beloved of your [[brother]] edgar.’
hum! conspiracy? ‘sleep till i wake him, you should enjoy half
his [[revenue]].’—my [[son]] edgar! had he a hand to write this? a heart
and brain to breed it in? when came this to you? who brought it?

edmund.
it was not brought me, my [[lord]], there’s the cunning of it. i
found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.

gloucester.
you [[know]] the [[character]] to be your brother’s?

edmund.
if the matter were [[good]], my [[lord]], i durst swear it were his; but
in [[respect]] of that, i would fain [[think]] it were not.

gloucester.
it is his.

edmund.
it is his hand, my [[lord]]; but i [[hope]] his [[heart]] is not in the
contents.

gloucester.
has he never before sounded you in this [[business]]?

edmund.
never, my [[lord]]. but i have heard him oft maintain it to be fit
that, sons [[son]] at [[perfect]] [[age]], and fathers [[father]] declined, the father
should be as ward to the [[son]], and the [[son]] manage his [[revenue]].

gloucester.
o villain, villain! his very [[opinion]] in the letter! abhorred
villain! unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than
brutish! go, sirrah, seek him; i’ll apprehend him. abominable
villain, where is he?

edmund.
i do not well [[know]], my [[lord]]. if it shall please you to suspend
your indignation against my [[brother]] till you can derive from him
better testimony of his intent, you should run a [[certain]] course;
where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his
purpose, it would make a [[great]] gap in your own [[honour]], and shake
in pieces the [[heart]] of his [[obedience]]. i dare pawn down my life
for him, that he hath writ this to [[feel]] my affection to your
honour, and to no other pretence of danger.

gloucester.
think you so?

edmund.
if your [[honour]] [[judge]] it meet, i will place you where you shall hear us
confer of this, and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction,
and that without any further delay than this very evening.

gloucester.
he cannot be such a monster.

edmund.
nor is not, sure.

gloucester.
to his [[father]], that so tenderly and entirely loves [[love]] him. heaven
and earth! edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, i [[pray]] you:
frame the [[business]] after your own [[wisdom]]. i would unstate myself
to be in a due resolution.

edmund.
i will seek him, sir, presently; convey the [[business]] as i shall
find means, and acquaint you withal.

gloucester.
these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no [[good]] to us:
though the [[wisdom]] of [[nature]] can [[reason]] it thus and thus, yet
nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. [[love]] cools,
friendship falls off, brothers [[brother]] divide: in cities [[city]], mutinies; in
countries, discord; in palaces, [[treason]]; and the bond cracked
’twixt [[son]] and [[father]]. this villain of mine comes under the
prediction; there’s [[son]] against [[father]]: the [[king]] falls from
bias of [[nature]]; there’s [[father]] against child. we have seen the
best of our [[time]]. machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
ruinous disorders [[follow]] us disquietly to our graves. find out
this villain, edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it
carefully.—and the [[noble]] and true-hearted kent banished! his
offence, honesty! ’tis [[strange]].

 [_exit._]

edmund.
this is the excellent foppery of the [[world]], that, when we are
sick in [[fortune]], often the surfeits of our own behaviour, we
make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as
if we were villains on necessity; fools [[fool]] by heavenly compulsion;
knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance;
drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced [[obedience]] of
planetary influence; and all that we are [[evil]] in, by a divine
thrusting on. an admirable evasion of whoremaster [[man]], to lay his
goatish disposition to the charge of a star. my [[father]] compounded
with my [[mother]] under the dragon’s tail, and my nativity was under
ursa major, so that it follows i am rough and lecherous. fut! i
should have been that i am, had the maidenliest star in the
firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.

 enter edgar.

pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy: my cue
is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like tom o’bedlam.—o,
these eclipses do portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.

edgar.
how now, [[brother]] edmund, what serious contemplation are you in?

edmund.
i am thinking, [[brother]], of a prediction i [[read]] this other day,
what should [[follow]] these eclipses.

edgar.
do you busy yourself with that?

edmund.
i promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of
unnaturalness between the child and the parent; [[death]], dearth,
dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in [[state]], menaces and
maledictions against [[king]] and nobles [[noble]]; needless diffidences,
banishment of [[friends]], dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches,
and i [[know]] not what.

edgar.
how long have you been a sectary astronomical?

edmund.
come, come! when saw you my [[father]] [[last]]?

edgar.
the night gone by.

edmund.
spake you with him?

edgar.
ay, two hours together.

edmund.
parted you in [[good]] terms? found you no displeasure in him, by word
nor countenance?

edgar.
none at all.

edmund.
bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him: and at my
entreaty forbear his presence until some little [[time]] hath
qualified the heat of his displeasure; which at this instant so
rageth in him that with the mischief of your [[person]] it would
scarcely allay.

edgar.
some villain hath done me [[wrong]].

edmund.
that’s my [[fear]]. i [[pray]] you have a continent forbearance till the
speed of his rage goes slower; and, as i say, retire with me to
my lodging, from whence i will fitly bring you to hear my lord
speak: [[pray]] ye, go; there’s my key. if you do stir abroad, go
armed.

edgar.
armed, [[brother]]?

edmund.
brother, i advise you to the [[best]]; i am no honest man
if there be any [[good]] meaning toward you: i have told you what i
have seen and heard. but faintly; nothing like the image and
horror of it: [[pray]] you, away!

edgar.
shall i hear from you anon?

edmund.
i do serve you in this [[business]].

a credulous father! and a [[brother]] [[noble]],
whose [[nature]] is so far from doing harms
that he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
my practices ride easy! i see the [[business]].
let me, if not by birth, have lands [[land]] by wit;
all with me’s meet that i can [[fashion]] fit.

scene iii. a room in the duke of albany’s palace.

 enter goneril and oswald.

goneril.
did my [[father]] strike my gentleman for chiding of his [[fool]]?

oswald.
ay, madam.

goneril.
by day and night, he wrongs [[wrong]] me; every hour
he flashes into one gross crime or other,
that sets us all at odds; i’ll not endure it:
his knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
on every trifle. when he returns from hunting,
i will not speak with him; say i am sick.
if you come slack of former services,
you shall do well; the [[fault]] of it i’ll [[answer]].

 [_horns within._]

oswald.
he’s coming, madam; i hear him.

goneril.
put on what weary negligence you please,
you and your fellows; i’d have it come to [[question]]:
if he distaste it, let him to our sister,
whose [[mind]] and mine, i [[know]], in that are one,
not to be overruled. idle old [[man]],
that still would manage those authorities
that he hath given away! now, by my [[life]],
old fools [[fool]] are babes again; and must be us’d
with checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus’d.
remember what i have said.

oswald.
very well, madam.

goneril.
and let his knights have colder looks among you;
what grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so;
i would breed from hence occasions [[occasion]], and i shall,
that i may speak. i’ll write straight to my sister
to hold my very course. prepare for dinner.

scene iv. a hall in albany’s palace.

 enter kent, disguised.

kent.
if but as well i other accents borrow,
that can my [[speech]] defuse, my [[good]] intent
may carry through itself to that full issue
for which i rais’d my likeness. now, banish’d kent,
if thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn’d,
so may it come, thy master, whom thou lov’st,
shall find thee full of labours [[labour]].

 horns within. enter king
lear, knights and attendants.

lear.
let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.

 [_exit an attendant._]

how now! what art [[arts]] thou?

kent.
a [[man]], sir.

lear.
what dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?

kent.
i do profess to be no less than i seem; to serve him truly that
will put me in trust; to [[love]] him that is honest; to converse
with him that is [[wise]] and says little; to [[fear]] judgement; to fight
when i cannot choose; and to [[eat]] no fish.

lear.
what art [[arts]] thou?

kent.
a very honest-hearted fellow, and as [[poor]] as the [[king]].

lear.
if thou be’st as [[poor]] for a [[subject]] as he’s for a [[king]], thou art
poor enough. what wouldst thou?

kent.
service.

lear.
who wouldst thou serve?

kent.
you.

lear.
dost thou [[know]] me, fellow?

kent.
no, sir; but you have that in your countenance which i would fain
call master.

lear.
what’s that?

kent.
authority.

lear.
what services canst thou do?

kent.
i can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a [[curious]] tale in
telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. that which
ordinary [[men]] are fit for, i am qualified in, and the [[best]] of
me is diligence.

lear.
how old art [[arts]] thou?

kent.
not so [[young]], sir, to [[love]] a woman for singing; nor so old to
dote on her for anything: i have years on my back forty-eight.

lear.
follow me; thou shalt serve me. if i like thee no worse after dinner, i
will not part from thee yet. dinner, ho, dinner! where’s my knave? my
fool? go you and call my [[fool]] hither.

 [_exit an attendant._]

 enter oswald.

you, you, sirrah, where’s my [[daughter]]?

oswald.
so please you,—

 [_exit._]

lear.
what says the fellow there? call the clotpoll back.

 [_exit a knight._]

where’s my [[fool]]? ho, i [[think]] the world’s asleep.

 re-enter knight.

how now! where’s that mongrel?

knight.
he says, my [[lord]], your [[daughter]] is not well.

lear.
why came not the [[slave]] back to me when i called him?

knight.
sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not.

lear.
he would not?

knight.
my [[lord]], i [[know]] not what the matter is; but to my judgement your
highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as
you were wont; there’s a [[great]] abatement of [[kindness]] appears as
well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also, and
your [[daughter]].

lear.
ha! say’st thou so?

knight.
i beseech you pardon me, my [[lord]], if i be mistaken; for my duty
cannot be silent when i [[think]] your highness wronged.

lear.
thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: i have perceived
a most faint neglect of late; which i have rather blamed as mine
own [[jealous]] curiosity than as a very pretence and [[purpose]] of
unkindness: i will look further into’t. but where’s my [[fool]]? i
have not seen him this two days.

knight.
since my [[young]] lady’s going into [[france]], sir, the [[fool]] hath much
pined away.

lear.
no more of that; i have noted it well. go you and tell my
daughter i would speak with her.

 [_exit attendant._]

go you, call hither my [[fool]].

 [_exit another attendant._]

 re-enter oswald.

o, you, sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am i, sir?

oswald.
my lady’s [[father]].

lear.
my lady’s father! my lord’s knave: you whoreson dog! you slave! you
cur!

oswald.
i am none of these, my [[lord]]; i beseech your pardon.

lear.
do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?

 [_striking him._]

oswald.
i’ll not be struck, my [[lord]].

kent.
nor tripp’d neither, you base football player.

 [_tripping up his heels._]

lear.
i thank thee, fellow. thou serv’st me, and i’ll [[love]] thee.

kent.
come, sir, arise, away! i’ll [[teach]] you differences: away, away! if you
will measure your lubber’s length again, tarry; but away! go to; have
you [[wisdom]]? so.

 [_pushes oswald out._]

lear.
now, my friendly knave, i thank thee: there’s earnest of thy service.

 [_giving kent [[money]]._]

 enter [[fool]].

fool.
let me hire him too; here’s my coxcomb.

 [_giving kent his cap._]

lear.
how now, my pretty knave, how dost thou?

fool.
sirrah, you were [[best]] take my coxcomb.

kent.
why, [[fool]]?

fool.
why, for taking one’s part that’s out of favour. nay, an thou
canst not smile as the wind sits, thou’lt catch cold shortly:
there, take my coxcomb: why, this fellow has banish’d two on’s
daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will; if
thou [[follow]] him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb. how now,
nuncle! would i had two coxcombs and two daughters!

lear.
why, my boy?

fool.
if i gave them all my living, i’d keep my coxcombs myself. there’s
mine; beg another of thy daughters [[daughter]].

lear.
take heed, sirrah, the whip.

fool.
truth’s a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped out, when
the [[lady]] brach may stand by the [[fire]] and stink.

lear.
a pestilent gall to me!

fool.
sirrah, i’ll [[teach]] thee a [[speech]].

lear.
do.

fool.
mark it, nuncle:
    have more than thou showest,
    speak less than thou knowest,
    lend less than thou owest,
    ride more than thou goest,
    learn more than thou trowest,
    set less than thou throwest;
    leave thy drink and thy whore,
    and keep in-a-door,
    and thou shalt have more
    than two tens to a score.

kent.
this is nothing, [[fool]].

fool.
then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer, you gave me
nothing for’t. can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?

lear.
why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.

fool.
[_to kent._] prythee tell him, so much the rent of his land
comes to: he will not [[believe]] a [[fool]].

lear.
a bitter [[fool]].

fool.
dost thou [[know]] the difference, my boy, between a bitter [[fool]] and
a sweet one?

lear.
no, lad; [[teach]] me.

fool.
   that [[lord]] that counsell’d thee
     to give away thy [[land]],
   come place him here by me,
     do thou for him stand.
   the sweet and bitter fool
     will presently appear;
   the one in motley here,
     the other found out there.

lear.
dost thou call me [[fool]], boy?

fool.
all thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born
with.

kent.
this is not altogether [[fool]], my [[lord]].

fool.
no, [[faith]]; lords [[lord]] and [[great]] [[men]] will not let me; if i had a
monopoly out, they would have part on’t and ladies [[lady]] too, they
will not let me have all the [[fool]] to myself; they’ll be
snatching. nuncle, give me an egg, and i’ll give thee two
crowns.

lear.
what two crowns [[crown]] shall they be?

fool.
why, after i have cut the egg i’ the middle and [[eat]] up the
meat, the two crowns [[crown]] of the egg. when thou clovest thy [[crown]] i’
the middle and gav’st away both parts, thou bor’st thine ass on
thy back o’er the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown
when thou gav’st thy golden one away. if i speak like myself in
this, let him be whipped that first finds it so.
[_singing._]
   fools [[fool]] had ne’er less grace in a year;
     for [[wise]] [[men]] are grown foppish,
   and [[know]] not how their wits to wear,
     their manners are so apish.

lear.
when were you wont to be so full of songs [[song]], sirrah?

fool.
i have used it, nuncle, e’er since thou mad’st thy daughters [[daughter]] thy
mothers; for when thou gav’st them the rod, and put’st down thine
own breeches,
[_singing._]
   then they for sudden joy did weep,
     and i for [[sorrow]] sung,
   that such a [[king]] should play bo-peep,
     and go the fools [[fool]] among.
prythee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can [[teach]] thy [[fool]] to
lie; i would fain learn to [[lie]].

lear.
an you [[lie]], sirrah, we’ll have you whipped.

fool.
i marvel what kin thou and thy daughters [[daughter]] are: they’ll have me
whipped for speaking true; thou’lt have me whipped for lying;
and sometimes i am whipped for holding my [[peace]]. i had rather be
any [[kind]] o’thing than a [[fool]]: and yet i would not be thee,
nuncle: thou hast pared thy wit o’both sides, and left nothing
i’ the middle: here comes one o’ the parings.

 enter goneril.

lear.
how now, [[daughter]]? what makes that frontlet on? methinks you
are too much of late i’ the frown.

fool.
thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to [[care]] for
her frowning. now thou art [[arts]] an o without a figure: i am better
than thou art [[arts]] now. i am a [[fool]], thou art [[arts]] nothing. [_to goneril._]
yes, forsooth, i will hold my tongue. so your face bids me, though
you say nothing. mum, mum,
     he that keeps nor crust nor crum,
     weary of all, shall want some.
[_pointing to lear_.] that’s a shealed peascod.

goneril.
not only, sir, this your all-licens’d [[fool]],
but other of your insolent retinue
do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth
in rank and not-to-be-endured riots. sir,
i had [[thought]], by making this well known unto you,
to have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,
by what yourself too late have spoke and done,
that you [[protect]] this course, and put it on
by your allowance; which if you should, the fault
would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
might in their working do you that offence
which else were shame, that then necessity
will call discreet proceeding.

fool.
for you [[know]], nuncle,
   the hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long
   that it’s had it head bit off by it [[young]].
so out went the candle, and we were left darkling.

lear.
are you our [[daughter]]?

goneril.
come, sir,
i would you would make use of that [[good]] [[wisdom]],
whereof i [[know]] you are fraught; and put away
these dispositions, which of late transform you
from what you rightly are.

fool.
may not an ass [[know]] when the cart draws the horse? whoop, jug! i
love thee!

lear.
doth any here [[know]] me? this is not lear;
doth lear walk thus? speak thus? where are his [[eyes]]?
either his notion weakens, his discernings
are lethargied. ha! waking? ’tis not so!
who is it that can tell me who i am?

fool.
lear’s shadow.

lear.
i would learn that; for by the marks of sovereignty, [[knowledge]] and
reason, i should be false persuaded i had daughters [[daughter]].

fool.
which they will make an [[obedient]] [[father]].

lear.
your name, [[fair]] gentlewoman?

goneril.
this admiration, sir, is much o’ the favour
of other your new pranks. i do beseech you
to [[understand]] my purposes [[purpose]] aright:
as you are old and reverend, you should be [[wise]].
here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
men so disorder’d, so debosh’d and bold
that this our court, infected with their manners,
shows like a riotous inn. epicurism and lust
makes it more like a tavern or a brothel
than a grac’d palace. the shame itself doth speak
for instant remedy. be, then, desir’d
by her that else will take the thing she begs
a little to disquantity your train;
and the remainder that shall still depend,
to be such [[men]] as may besort your [[age]],
which [[know]] themselves, and you.

lear.
darkness and devils!
saddle my horses; call my train together.
degenerate bastard! i’ll not trouble thee:
yet have i left a [[daughter]].

goneril.
you strike my [[people]]; and your disorder’d rabble
make servants of their betters.

 enter albany.

lear.
woe that too late repents!—
[_to albany._] o, sir, are you come?
is it your will? speak, sir.—prepare my horses.
ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
more hideous when thou show’st thee in a child
than the sea-monster!

albany.
pray, sir, be patient.

lear.
[_to goneril._] detested kite, thou liest.
my train are [[men]] of [[choice]] and rarest parts,
that all particulars of [[duty]] [[know]];
and in the most exact regard support
the worships of their name. o most small [[fault]],
how ugly didst thou in cordelia show!
which, like an engine, wrench’d my frame of nature
from the fix’d place; drew from my [[heart]] all [[love]],
and added to the gall. o lear, lear, lear!
[_striking his head._] beat at this gate that let thy folly in
and thy dear judgement out! go, go, my [[people]].

albany.
my [[lord]], i am guiltless, as i am ignorant
of what hath moved you.

lear.
it may be so, my [[lord]].
hear, [[nature]], hear; dear [[goddess]], hear
suspend thy [[purpose]], if thou didst intend
to make this creature fruitful!
into her womb convey sterility!
dry up in her the organs of increase;
and from her derogate [[body]] never spring
a babe to [[honour]] her! if she must teem,
create her child of spleen, that it may live
and be a thwart disnatur’d torment to her!
let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of [[youth]];
with cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
turn all her mother’s pains [[pain]] and benefits
to laughter and contempt; that she may feel
how sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is
to have a thankless child! away, away!

 [_exit._]

albany.
now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?

goneril.
never afflict yourself to [[know]] more of it;
but let his disposition have that scope
that dotage gives it.

 re-enter lear.

lear.
what, fifty of my followers at a clap?
within a fortnight?

albany.
what’s the matter, sir?

lear.
i’ll tell thee. [_to goneril._] [[life]] and death! i am
asham’d
that thou hast [[power]] to shake my manhood thus;
that these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
should make thee worth them. blasts and fogs upon thee!
th’untented woundings of a father’s curse
pierce every sense about thee! old fond [[eyes]],
beweep this cause again, i’ll pluck ye out,
and cast you with the waters that you lose
to temper clay. ha! let it be so.
i have another [[daughter]],
who, i am sure, is [[kind]] and comfortable:
when she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
she’ll flay thy wolvish visage. thou shalt find
that i’ll resume the shape which thou dost think
i have cast off for ever.

 [_exeunt lear, kent and attendants._]

goneril.
do you mark that?

albany.
i cannot be so partial, goneril,
to the [[great]] [[love]] i bear you,—

goneril.
pray you, content. what, oswald, ho!
[_to the [[fool]]._] you, sir, more knave than [[fool]], after your master.

fool.
nuncle lear, nuncle lear, tarry and take the [[fool]] with thee.
   a fox when one has caught her,
   and such a [[daughter]],
   should sure to the slaughter,
   if my cap would buy a halter;
   so the [[fool]] follows after.

 [_exit._]

goneril.
this [[man]] hath had [[good]] counsel.—a hundred knights!
’tis [[politic]] and safe to let him keep
at point a hundred knights: yes, that on every [[dream]],
each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
he may enguard his dotage with their powers [[power]],
and hold our lives [[life]] in [[mercy]]. oswald, i say!

albany.
well, you may [[fear]] too far.

goneril.
safer than trust too far:
let me still take away the harms i [[fear]],
not [[fear]] still to be taken: i [[know]] his [[heart]].
what he hath utter’d i have writ my sister:
if she sustain him and his hundred knights,
when i have show’d th’unfitness,—

 re-enter oswald.

how now, oswald!
what, have you writ that letter to my sister?

oswald.
ay, madam.

goneril.
take you some company, and away to horse:
inform her full of my particular [[fear]];
and thereto add such reasons [[reason]] of your own
as may compact it more. get you gone;
and hasten your return.

 [_exit oswald._]

no, no, my lord!
this milky gentleness and course of yours,
though i condemn not, yet, under pardon,
you are much more attask’d for want of wisdom
than prais’d for harmful mildness.

albany.
how far your [[eyes]] may pierce i cannot tell:
striving to [[better]], oft we mar what’s well.

goneril.
nay then,—

albany.
well, well; the event.

lear.
go you before to gloucester with these letters: acquaint my
daughter no further with anything you [[know]] than comes from her
demand out of the letter. if your diligence be not speedy, i
shall be there afore you.

i will not sleep, my [[lord]], till i have delivered your letter.

if a man’s brains were in’s heels, were’t not in danger of

lear.
ay, boy.

fool.
then i prythee be merry; thy wit shall not go slipshod.

lear.
ha, ha, ha!

fool.
shalt see thy other [[daughter]] will use thee kindly, for though
she’s as like this as a crab’s like an apple, yet i can tell
what i can tell.

lear.
what canst tell, boy?

fool.
she’ll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. thou
canst tell why one’s nose stands i’the middle on’s face?

lear.
no.

fool.
why, to keep one’s [[eyes]] of either side’s nose, that what a man
cannot smell out, he may spy into.

lear.
i did her [[wrong]].

fool.
canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?

lear.
no.

fool.
nor i neither; but i can tell why a snail has a house.

lear.
why?

fool.
why, to put’s head in; not to give it away to his daughters [[daughter]], and
leave his horns without a case.

lear.
i will forget my [[nature]]. so [[kind]] a father! be my horses ready?

fool.
thy asses are gone about ’em. the [[reason]] why the seven stars are
no more than seven is a pretty [[reason]].

lear.
because they are not eight?

fool.
yes indeed: thou wouldst make a [[good]] [[fool]].

lear.
to tak’t again perforce!—monster ingratitude!

fool.
if thou wert my [[fool]], nuncle, i’ld have thee beaten for being
old before thy [[time]].

act ii

scene i. a court within the castle of the earl of gloucester.

 enter edmund and curan, meeting.

edmund.
save thee, curan.

curan.
and you, sir. i have been with your [[father]], and given him
notice that the duke of cornwall and regan his duchess will be
here with him this night.

edmund.
how comes that?

curan.
nay, i [[know]] not. you have heard of the news abroad; i mean the
whispered ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?

edmund.
not i: [[pray]] you, what are they?

curan.
have you heard of no likely wars [[war]] toward, ’twixt the two dukes
of cornwall and albany?

edmund.
not a word.

curan.
you may do, then, in [[time]]. fare you well, sir.

 [_exit._]

edmund.
the duke be here tonight? the better! best!
this weaves itself perforce into my [[business]].
my [[father]] hath set guard to take my [[brother]];
and i have one thing, of a queasy [[question]],
which i must act. briefness and [[fortune]] work!
brother, a word, descend, [[brother]], i say!

 enter edgar.

my [[father]] watches: o sir, fly this place;
intelligence is given where you are hid;
you have now the [[good]] advantage of the night.
have you not spoken ’gainst the duke of cornwall?
he’s coming hither; now, i’ the night, i’ the haste,
and regan with him: have you nothing said
upon his party ’gainst the duke of albany?
advise yourself.

edgar.
i am sure on’t, not a word.

edmund.
i hear my [[father]] coming:—pardon me;
in cunning i must draw my [[sword]] upon you:
draw: seem to defend yourself: now quit you well.
yield: come before my [[father]]. [[light]], ho, here!
fly, [[brother]]. torches, torches!—so farewell.

 [_exit edgar._]

some [[blood]] drawn on me would beget opinion
of my more fierce endeavour: [_wounds his arm._]
i have seen drunkards
do more than this in [[sport]]. [[father]], father!
stop, stop! no [[help]]?

 enter gloucester and
servants with torches.

gloucester.
now, edmund, where’s the villain?

edmund.
here stood he in the dark, his sharp [[sword]] out,
mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
to stand auspicious mistress.

gloucester.
but where is he?

edmund.
look, sir, i bleed.

gloucester.
where is the villain, edmund?

edmund.
fled this way, sir. when by no means he could,—

gloucester.
pursue him, ho! go after.

 [_exeunt servants._]

—by no means what?

edmund.
persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
but that i told him the revenging gods
’gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
spoke with how manifold and [[strong]] a bond
the child was bound to the [[father]]; sir, in fine,
seeing how loathly opposite i stood
to his unnatural [[purpose]], in fell motion
with his prepared [[sword]], he charges home
my unprovided [[body]], latch’d mine arm;
but when he saw my [[best]] alarum’d spirits,
bold in the quarrel’s [[right]], rous’d to th’encounter,
or whether gasted by the noise i made,
full suddenly he fled.

gloucester.
let him fly far;
not in this [[land]] shall he remain uncaught;
and found—dispatch’d. the [[noble]] duke my master,
my worthy arch and patron, comes tonight:
by his [[authority]] i will proclaim it,
that he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
bringing the murderous [[coward]] to the stake;
he that conceals him, [[death]].

edmund.
when i dissuaded him from his intent,
and found him pight to do it, with curst speech
i threaten’d to discover him: he replied,
‘thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou [[think]],
if i would stand against thee, would the reposal
of any trust, [[virtue]], or worth in thee
make thy words faith’d? no: what i should deny
as this i would; ay, though thou didst produce
my very [[character]], i’d turn it all
to thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice:
and thou must make a dullard of the [[world]],
if they not [[thought]] the profits [[profit]] of my death
were very pregnant and potential spurs
to make thee seek it.

gloucester.
o [[strange]] and fast’ned villain!
would he deny his letter, said he? i never got him.

 [_tucket within._]

hark, the duke’s trumpets! i [[know]] not why he comes.
all ports i’ll bar; the villain shall not scape;
the duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
i will send far and near, that all the kingdom
may have due note of him; and of my [[land]],
loyal and [[natural]] boy, i’ll [[work]] the means
to make thee capable.

 enter cornwall, regan and
attendants.

cornwall.
how now, my [[noble]] friend! since i came hither,
which i can call but now, i have heard [[strange]] news.

regan.
if it be true, all vengeance comes too short
which can pursue th’offender. how dost, my [[lord]]?

gloucester.
o madam, my old [[heart]] is crack’d, it’s crack’d!

regan.
what, did my father’s godson seek your [[life]]?
he whom my [[father]] nam’d? your edgar?

gloucester.
o [[lady]], [[lady]], shame would have it hid!

regan.
was he not companion with the riotous knights
that tend upon my [[father]]?

gloucester.
i [[know]] not, madam; ’tis too [[bad]], too [[bad]].

edmund.
yes, madam, he was of that consort.

regan.
no marvel then though he were ill affected:
’tis they have put him on the old man’s [[death]],
to have the expense and waste of his revenues [[revenue]].
i have this [[present]] evening from my sister
been well inform’d of them; and with such cautions
that if they come to sojourn at my house,
i’ll not be there.

cornwall.
nor i, assure thee, regan.
edmund, i hear that you have shown your father
a childlike office.

edmund.
it was my [[duty]], sir.

gloucester.
he did bewray his practice; and receiv’d
this hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.

cornwall.
is he pursued?

gloucester.
ay, my [[good]] [[lord]].

cornwall.
if he be taken, he shall never more
be fear’d of doing harm: make your own [[purpose]],
how in my [[strength]] you please. for you, edmund,
whose [[virtue]] and [[obedience]] doth this instant
so much commend itself, you shall be ours:
natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
you we first seize on.

edmund.
i shall serve you, sir, truly, however else.

gloucester.
for him i thank your grace.

cornwall.
you [[know]] not why we came to visit you?

regan.
thus out of season, threading dark-ey’d night:
occasions, [[noble]] gloucester, of some poise,
wherein we must have use of your [[advice]].
our [[father]] he hath writ, so hath our sister,
of differences, which i [[best]] [[thought]] it fit
to [[answer]] from our [[home]]; the several messengers
from hence attend dispatch. our [[good]] old friend,
lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
your needful counsel to our [[business]],
which craves the instant use.

gloucester.
i serve you, madam:
your graces are [[right]] welcome.

 [_exeunt. flourish._]

scene ii. before gloucester’s castle.

 enter kent and oswald,
severally.

oswald.
good dawning to thee, friend: art [[arts]] of this house?

kent.
ay.

oswald.
where may we set our horses?

kent.
i’ the mire.

oswald.
prythee, if thou lov’st me, tell me.

kent.
i [[love]] thee not.

oswald.
why then, i [[care]] not for thee.

kent.
if i had thee in lipsbury pinfold, i would make thee [[care]] for me.

oswald.
why dost thou use me thus? i [[know]] thee not.

kent.
fellow, i [[know]] thee.

oswald.
what dost thou [[know]] me for?

kent.
a knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud,
shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,
worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking, whoreson,
glass-gazing, super-serviceable, finical rogue;
one trunk-inheriting [[slave]]; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of
good service, and art [[arts]] nothing but the composition of a
knave, beggar, [[coward]], pander, and the [[son]] and heir of a mongrel
bitch: one whom i will beat into clamorous whining, if thou
deniest the least syllable of thy addition.

oswald.
why, what a monstrous fellow art [[arts]] thou, thus to rail on one that’s
neither known of thee nor knows [[know]] thee?

kent.
what a brazen-faced varlet art [[arts]] thou, to deny thou knowest me! is
it two days ago since i tripped up thy heels and beat thee before
the [[king]]? draw, you rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon
shines; i’ll make a sop o’ the moonshine of you: draw, you
whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw!

 [_drawing his [[sword]]._]

oswald.
away! i have nothing to do with thee.

kent.
draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the [[king]]; and
take vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her [[father]]:
draw, you rogue, or i’ll so carbonado your shanks:—draw, you rascal;
come your ways!

oswald.
help, ho! murder! help!

kent.
strike, you [[slave]]; stand, rogue, stand; you neat [[slave]], strike!

 [_beating him._]

oswald.
help, ho! murder! murder!

 enter edmund, cornwall, regan,
gloucester and servants.

edmund.
how now! what’s the matter? part!

kent.
with you, goodman boy, if you please: come, i’ll flesh ye; come
on, [[young]] master.

gloucester.
weapons! arms! what’s the matter here?

cornwall.
keep [[peace]], upon your lives [[life]], he dies that strikes again. what is the
matter?

regan.
the messengers from our sister and the [[king]].

cornwall.
what is your difference? speak.

oswald.
i am scarce in breath, my [[lord]].

kent.
no marvel, you have so bestirr’d your valour. you cowardly
rascal, [[nature]] disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.

cornwall.
thou art [[arts]] a [[strange]] fellow: a tailor make a [[man]]?

kent.
ay, a tailor, sir: a stonecutter or a painter could not have
made him so ill, though he had been but two years at the [[trade]].

cornwall.
speak yet, how grew your quarrel?

oswald.
this ancient ruffian, sir, whose [[life]] i have spared at suit of his grey
beard,—

kent.
thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! my [[lord]], if you’ll
give me leave, i will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and
daub the walls of a jakes with him. spare my grey beard, you wagtail?

cornwall.
peace, sirrah!
you beastly knave, [[know]] you no reverence?

kent.
yes, sir; but anger hath a [[privilege]].

cornwall.
why art [[arts]] thou angry?

kent.
that such a [[slave]] as this should wear a [[sword]],
who wears no honesty. such smiling rogues as these,
like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
which are too intrince t’unloose; smooth every passion
that in the natures [[nature]] of their lords [[lord]] rebel;
bring [[oil]] to [[fire]], snow to their colder moods;
renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
with every gale and vary of their masters,
knowing naught, like dogs, but following.
a plague upon your epileptic visage!
smile you my speeches [[speech]], as i were a [[fool]]?
goose, if i had you upon sarum plain,
i’d drive ye cackling [[home]] to camelot.

cornwall.
what, art [[arts]] thou mad, old fellow?

gloucester.
how fell you out? say that.

kent.
no contraries hold more antipathy
than i and such a knave.

cornwall.
why dost thou call him knave? what is his [[fault]]?

kent.
his countenance likes me not.

cornwall.
no more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.

kent.
sir, ’tis my occupation to be plain:
i have seen [[better]] faces in my time
than stands on any shoulder that i see
before me at this instant.

cornwall.
this is some fellow
who, having been prais’d for bluntness, doth affect
a saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
quite from his [[nature]]: he cannot flatter, he,
an honest [[mind]] and plain, he must speak truth!
an they will take it, so; if not, he’s plain.
these [[kind]] of knaves i [[know]] which in this plainness
harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
than twenty silly-ducking observants
that stretch their duties [[duty]] nicely.

kent.
sir, in [[good]] [[faith]], in sincere verity,
under th’allowance of your [[great]] aspect,
whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
on flickering phoebus’ front,—

cornwall.
what mean’st by this?

kent.
to go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. i [[know]],
sir, i am no flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain accent
was a plain knave; which, for my part, i will not be, though i
should [[win]] your displeasure to entreat me to’t.

cornwall.
what was the offence you gave him?

oswald.
i never gave him any:
it pleas’d the [[king]] his master very late
to strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
when he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,
tripp’d me behind; being down, insulted, rail’d
and put upon him such a deal of [[man]],
that worthied him, got praises [[praise]] of the king
for him attempting who was self-subdu’d;
and, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
drew on me here again.

kent.
none of these rogues and cowards
but ajax is their [[fool]].

cornwall.
fetch forth the stocks!
you stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,
we’ll [[teach]] you.

kent.
sir, i am too old to learn:
call not your stocks for me: i serve the [[king]];
on whose employment i was sent to you:
you shall do small [[respect]], show too bold malice
against the grace and [[person]] of my master,
stocking his messenger.

cornwall.
fetch forth the stocks!
as i have [[life]] and [[honour]], there shall he sit till noon.

regan.
till noon! till night, my [[lord]]; and all night too!

kent.
why, madam, if i were your father’s dog,
you should not use me so.

regan.
sir, being his knave, i will.

 [_stocks brought out._]

cornwall.
this is a fellow of the selfsame colour
our sister speaks of. come, bring away the stocks!

gloucester.
let me beseech your grace not to do so:
his [[fault]] is much, and the [[good]] [[king]] his master
will check him for’t: your purpos’d low correction
is such as basest and contemned’st wretches
for pilferings and most [[common]] trespasses,
are punish’d with. the [[king]] must take it ill
that he, so slightly valued in his messenger,
should have him thus restrained.

cornwall.
i’ll [[answer]] that.

regan.
my sister may receive it much more worse,
to have her gentleman abus’d, assaulted,
for following her affairs. put in his legs.

 [_kent is put in the
stocks._]

cornwall.
come, my [[good]] [[lord]], away.

 [_exeunt all but gloucester and kent._]

gloucester.
i am [[sorry]] for thee, friend; ’tis the duke’s [[pleasure]],
whose disposition, all the [[world]] well knows [[know]],
will not be rubb’d nor stopp’d; i’ll entreat for thee.

kent.
pray do not, sir: i have watch’d, and travell’d hard;
some [[time]] i shall sleep out, the rest i’ll whistle.
a [[good]] man’s [[fortune]] may grow out at heels:
give you [[good]] morrow!

gloucester.
the duke’s to blame in this: ’twill be ill taken.

 [_exit._]

kent.
good [[king]], that must approve the [[common]] saw,
thou out of heaven’s benediction com’st
to the warm sun.
approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
that by thy comfortable beams i may
peruse this letter. nothing almost sees miracles
but misery. i [[know]] ’tis from cordelia,
who hath most fortunately been inform’d
of my obscured course. and shall find time
from this enormous [[state]], seeking to give
losses their remedies. all weary and o’erwatch’d,
take vantage, heavy [[eyes]], not to behold
this shameful lodging.
fortune, [[good]] night: smile once more, turn thy wheel!

 [_he sleeps._]

scene iii. the open [[country]].

 enter edgar.

edgar.
i heard myself proclaim’d,
and by the [[happy]] hollow of a tree
escap’d the hunt. no port is [[free]], no place
that guard and most unusual vigilance
does not attend my taking. while i may scape
i will preserve myself: and am bethought
to take the basest and most poorest shape
that ever penury in contempt of [[man]],
brought near to beast: my face i’ll grime with filth,
blanket my loins; elf all my hair in knots,
and with presented nakedness outface
the winds and persecutions of the [[sky]].
the [[country]] gives me proof and precedent
of bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
strike in their numb’d and mortified bare arms
pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
and with this horrible object, from low farms,
poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
enforce their charity. [[poor]] turlygod! [[poor]] tom,
that’s something yet: edgar i nothing am.

 [_exit._]

scene iv. before gloucester’s castle; kent in the stocks.

 enter lear, [[fool]] and gentleman.

lear.
’tis [[strange]] that they should so depart from [[home]],
and not send back my messenger.

gentleman.
as i learn’d,
the night before there was no [[purpose]] in them
of this remove.

kent.
hail to thee, [[noble]] master!

lear.
ha! mak’st thou this shame thy pastime?

kent.
no, my [[lord]].

fool.
ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. horses are tied by the
heads; dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins, and
men by the legs: when a [[man]] is overlusty at legs, then he
wears wooden nether-stocks.

lear.
what’s he that hath so much thy place mistook
to set thee here?

kent.
it is both he and she,
your [[son]] and [[daughter]].

lear.
no.

kent.
yes.

lear.
no, i say.

kent.
i say, yea.

lear.
no, no; they would not.

kent.
yes, they have.

lear.
by [[jupiter]], i swear no.

kent.
by juno, i swear ay.

lear.
they durst not do’t.
they could not, would not do’t; ’tis worse than murder,
to do upon [[respect]] such [[violent]] outrage:
resolve me, with all modest haste, which way
thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,
coming from us.

kent.
my [[lord]], when at their home
i did commend your highness’ letters to them,
ere i was risen from the place that show’d
my [[duty]] kneeling, came there a reeking post,
stew’d in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
from goneril his mistress salutations;
deliver’d letters, spite of intermission,
which presently they [[read]]; on those contents,
they summon’d up their meiny, straight took horse;
commanded me to [[follow]] and attend
the leisure of their [[answer]]; gave me cold looks:
and meeting here the other messenger,
whose welcome i perceiv’d had poison’d mine,
being the very fellow which of late
display’d so saucily against your highness,
having more [[man]] than wit about me, drew;
he rais’d the house with loud and [[coward]] cries.
your [[son]] and [[daughter]] found this trespass worth
the shame which here it suffers.

fool.
winter’s not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way.
  fathers [[father]] that wear rags
    do make their [[children]] blind,
  but fathers [[father]] that bear bags
    shall see their [[children]] [[kind]].
  [[fortune]], that arrant whore,
  ne’er turns the key to th’ [[poor]].
but for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy
daughters as thou canst tell in a year.

lear.
o, how this [[mother]] swells up toward my heart!
_hysterica passio_, down, thou climbing [[sorrow]],
thy element’s below! where is this [[daughter]]?

kent.
with the earl, sir, here within.

lear.
follow me not; stay here.

 [_exit._]

gentleman.
made you no more offence but what you speak of?

kent.
none.
how [[chance]] the [[king]] comes with so small a number?

fool.
an thou hadst been set i’ the stocks for that [[question]],
thou hadst well deserved it.

kent.
why, [[fool]]?

fool.
we’ll set thee to school to an ant, to [[teach]] thee there’s no
labouring i’the winter. all that [[follow]] their noses are [[led]] by
their [[eyes]] but blind [[men]]; and there’s not a nose among twenty
but can smell him that’s stinking. let go thy hold when a great
wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following
it; but the [[great]] one that goes upward, let him draw thee after.
when a [[wise]] [[man]] gives thee [[better]] counsel, give me mine again: i
would have none but knaves [[follow]] it, since a [[fool]] gives it.
          that sir which serves and seeks for gain,
             and follows but for form,
          will pack when it begins to rain,
             and leave thee in the storm.
          but i will tarry; the [[fool]] will stay,
             and let the [[wise]] [[man]] fly:
          the knave turns [[fool]] that runs away;
             the [[fool]] no knave perdy.
    

kent.
where learn’d you this, [[fool]]?

fool.
not i’ the stocks, [[fool]].

 enter lear and gloucester.

lear.
deny to speak with me? they are sick? they are weary?
they have travell’d all the night? mere fetches;
the images of revolt and flying off.
fetch me a [[better]] [[answer]].

gloucester.
my dear [[lord]],
you [[know]] the fiery quality of the duke;
how unremovable and fix’d he is
in his own course.

lear.
vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
fiery? what quality? why, gloucester, gloucester,
i’d speak with the duke of cornwall and his [[wife]].

gloucester.
well, my [[good]] [[lord]], i have inform’d them so.

lear.
inform’d them! dost thou [[understand]] me, [[man]]?

gloucester.
ay, my [[good]] [[lord]].

lear.
the [[king]] would speak with cornwall; the dear father
would with his [[daughter]] speak, commands, tends, service,
are they inform’d of this? my breath and blood!
fiery? the fiery duke, tell the hot duke that—
no, but not yet: maybe he is not well:
infirmity doth still neglect all office
whereto our health is bound: we are not ourselves
when [[nature]], being oppress’d, commands the mind
to suffer with the [[body]]: i’ll forbear;
and am fallen out with my more headier will,
to take the indispos’d and sickly fit
for the sound [[man]]. [_looking on kent._]
death on my state! wherefore
should he sit here? this act persuades me
that this remotion of the duke and her
is practice only. give me my servant forth.
go tell the duke and’s [[wife]] i’d speak with them,
now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
or at their chamber door i’ll beat the drum
till it cry sleep to [[death]].

gloucester.
i would have all well betwixt you.

 [_exit._]

lear.
o me, my [[heart]], my rising heart! but down!

fool.
cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she put ’em
i’ the paste alive; she knapped ’em o’ the coxcombs
with a stick and cried ‘down, wantons, down!’ ’twas
her [[brother]] that, in pure [[kindness]] to his horse buttered his hay.

 enter cornwall, regan,
gloucester and servants.

lear.
good morrow to you both.

cornwall.
hail to your grace!

 [_kent here set at [[liberty]]._]

regan.
i am glad to see your highness.

lear.
regan, i [[think]] you are; i [[know]] what reason
i have to [[think]] so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
i would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb,
sepulchring an adultress. [_to kent_] o, are you [[free]]?
some other [[time]] for that.—beloved regan,
thy sister’s naught: o regan, she hath tied
sharp-tooth’d unkindness, like a vulture, here.

 [_points to his [[heart]]._]

i can scarce speak to thee; thou’lt not believe
with how deprav’d a quality—o regan!

regan.
i [[pray]] you, sir, take patience. i have hope
you less [[know]] how to value her desert
than she to scant her [[duty]].

lear.
say, how is that?

regan.
i cannot [[think]] my sister in the least
would fail her obligation. if, sir, perchance
she have restrain’d the riots of your followers,
’tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
as clears her from all blame.

lear.
my curses on her.

regan.
o, sir, you are old;
nature in you stands on the very verge
of her confine: you should be rul’d and led
by some discretion, that discerns your state
better than you yourself. therefore i [[pray]] you,
that to our sister you do make return;
say you have wrong’d her, sir.

lear.
ask her forgiveness?
do you but mark how this becomes the house?
‘dear [[daughter]], i confess that i am old;
[_kneeling._]
age is unnecessary: on my knees i beg
that you’ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.’

regan.
good sir, no more! these are unsightly tricks:
return you to my sister.

lear.
[_rising._] never, regan:
she hath abated me of half my train;
look’d black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
most serpent-like, upon the very [[heart]].
all the stor’d vengeances of [[heaven]] fall
on her ingrateful top! strike her [[young]] bones,
you taking airs, with lameness!

cornwall.
fie, sir, fie!

lear.
you nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
into her scornful eyes! infect her [[beauty]],
you fen-suck’d fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,
to fall and blast her pride!

regan.
o the blest gods!
so will you [[wish]] on me when the rash mood is on.

lear.
no, regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
thy tender-hefted [[nature]] shall not give
thee o’er to harshness. her [[eyes]] are fierce; but thine
do comfort, and not burn. ’tis not in thee
to grudge my pleasures [[pleasure]], to cut off my train,
to bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
and, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
against my coming in. thou [[better]] know’st
the offices of [[nature]], bond of [[childhood]],
effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;
thy half o’ the [[kingdom]] hast thou not forgot,
wherein i thee endow’d.

regan.
good sir, to the [[purpose]].

lear.
who put my [[man]] i’ the stocks?

 [_tucket within._]

cornwall.
what trumpet’s that?

regan.
i know’t, my sister’s: this approves her letter,
that she would soon be here.

 enter oswald.

is your [[lady]] come?

lear.
this is a [[slave]], whose easy borrowed pride
dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
out, varlet, from my sight!

cornwall.
what means your grace?

lear.
who stock’d my servant? regan, i have [[good]] hope
thou didst not [[know]] on’t. who comes here? o heavens!

 enter goneril.

if you do [[love]] old [[men]], if your sweet sway
allow [[obedience]], if yourselves are old,
make it your cause; send down, and take my part!
[_to goneril._] art [[arts]] not asham’d to look upon this beard?
o regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?

goneril.
why not by the hand, sir? how have i offended?
all’s not offence that indiscretion finds
and dotage terms so.

lear.
o sides, you are too tough!
will you yet hold? how came my [[man]] i’ the stocks?

cornwall.
i set him there, sir: but his own disorders
deserv’d much less advancement.

lear.
you? did you?

regan.
i [[pray]] you, [[father]], being [[weak]], seem so.
if, till the expiration of your month,
you will return and sojourn with my sister,
dismissing half your train, come then to me:
i am now from [[home]], and out of that provision
which shall be needful for your entertainment.

lear.
return to her, and fifty [[men]] dismiss’d?
no, rather i abjure all roofs, and choose
to wage against the enmity o’ the air;
to be a comrade with the wolf and owl,
necessity’s sharp pinch! return with her?
why, the hot-blooded [[france]], that dowerless took
our youngest born, i could as well be brought
to knee his [[throne]], and, squire-like, pension beg
to keep base [[life]] afoot. return with her?
persuade me rather to be [[slave]] and sumpter
to this detested groom.

 [_pointing to oswald._]

goneril.
at your [[choice]], sir.

lear.
i prythee, [[daughter]], do not make me mad:
i will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:
we’ll no more meet, no more see one another.
but yet thou art [[arts]] my flesh, my [[blood]], my [[daughter]];
or rather a disease that’s in my flesh,
which i must needs call mine. thou art [[arts]] a boil,
a plague sore, or embossed carbuncle
in my corrupted [[blood]]. but i’ll not chide thee;
let shame come when it will, i do not call it:
i do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
nor tell tales of thee to high-judging jove:
mend when thou canst; be [[better]] at thy leisure:
i can be patient; i can stay with regan,
i and my hundred knights.

regan.
not altogether so,
i look’d not for you yet, nor am provided
for your fit welcome. give ear, sir, to my sister;
for those that mingle [[reason]] with your passion
must be content to [[think]] you old, and so—
but she knows [[know]] what she does.

lear.
is this well spoken?

regan.
i dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?
is it not well? what should you need of more?
yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
speak ’gainst so [[great]] a number? how in one house
should many [[people]], under two commands,
hold amity? ’tis hard; almost impossible.

goneril.
why might not you, my [[lord]], receive attendance
from those that she calls servants, or from mine?

regan.
why not, my [[lord]]? if then they chanc’d to slack ye,
we could control them. if you will come to me,—
for now i spy a danger,—i entreat you
to bring but five-and-twenty: to no more
will i give place or notice.

lear.
i gave you all,—

regan.
and in [[good]] [[time]] you gave it.

lear.
made you my guardians, my depositaries;
but kept a reservation to be followed
with such a number. what, must i come to you
with five-and-twenty, regan, said you so?

regan.
and speak’t again my [[lord]]; no more with me.

lear.
those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour’d
when others are more wicked; not being the worst
stands in some rank of [[praise]].
[_to goneril._] i’ll go with thee:
thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,
and thou art [[arts]] twice her [[love]].

goneril.
hear me, my [[lord]]:
what need you five-and-twenty? ten? or five?
to [[follow]] in a house where twice so many
have a command to tend you?

regan.
what need one?

lear.
o, [[reason]] not the need: our basest beggars
are in the poorest thing superfluous:
allow not [[nature]] more than [[nature]] needs,
man’s [[life]] is cheap as beast’s. thou art [[arts]] a [[lady]];
if only to go warm were gorgeous,
why, [[nature]] needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st
which scarcely keeps thee warm. but, for true need,—
you heavens [[heaven]], give me that patience, patience i need!
you see me here, you gods, a [[poor]] old [[man]],
as full of [[grief]] as [[age]]; wretched in both!
if it be you that stirs these daughters’ hearts
against their [[father]], [[fool]] me not so much
to bear it tamely; touch me with [[noble]] anger,
and let not women’s [[weapons]], water-drops,
stain my man’s cheeks! no, you unnatural hags,
i will have such revenges on you both
that all the [[world]] shall,—i will do such things,—
what they are yet, i [[know]] not; but they shall be
the terrors of the [[earth]]. you [[think]] i’ll weep;
no, i’ll not weep:— [_storm and tempest._]
i have full cause of weeping; but this heart
shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
or ere i’ll weep.—o [[fool]], i shall go mad!

 [_exeunt lear, gloucester, kent and [[fool]]._]

cornwall.
let us withdraw; ’twill be a storm.

regan.
this house is little: the old [[man]] and his people
cannot be well bestow’d.

goneril.
’tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest
and must needs taste his folly.

regan.
for his particular, i’ll receive him gladly,
but not one follower.

goneril.
so am i purpos’d.
where is my [[lord]] of gloucester?

 enter gloucester.

cornwall.
followed the old [[man]] forth, he is return’d.

gloucester.
the [[king]] is in high rage.

cornwall.
whither is he going?

gloucester.
he calls to horse; but will i [[know]] not whither.

cornwall.
’tis [[best]] to give him way; he leads himself.

goneril.
my [[lord]], entreat him by no means to stay.

gloucester.
alack, the night comes on, and the high winds
do sorely ruffle; for many miles about
there’s scarce a bush.

regan.
o, sir, to wilful men
the injuries that they themselves procure
must be their schoolmasters. shut up your doors.
he is attended with a desperate train,
and what they may incense him to, being apt
to have his ear abus’d, [[wisdom]] bids [[fear]].

cornwall.
shut up your doors, my [[lord]]; ’tis a wild night.
my regan counsels well: come out o’ the storm.

 [_exeunt._]



act iii

scene i. a heath.

 a storm with thunder and lightning. enter kent and a gentleman,
severally.

kent.
who’s there, besides foul weather?

gentleman.
one minded like the weather, most unquietly.

kent.
i [[know]] you. where’s the [[king]]?

gentleman.
contending with the fretful elements;
bids the wind blow the [[earth]] into the sea,
or swell the curled waters ’bove the main,
that things might [[change]] or cease; tears his [[white]] hair,
which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage,
catch in their fury and make nothing of;
strives in his little [[world]] of [[man]] to outscorn
the to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
this night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
the lion and the belly-pinched wolf
keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
and bids what will take all.

kent.
but who is with him?

gentleman.
none but the [[fool]], who labours [[labour]] to out-jest
his heart-struck injuries.

kent.
sir, i do [[know]] you;
and dare, upon the warrant of my note
commend a dear thing to you. there is division,
although as yet the face of it be cover’d
with mutual cunning, ’twixt albany and cornwall;
who have, as who have not, that their [[great]] stars
throne’d and set high; servants, who seem no less,
which are to [[france]] the spies and speculations
intelligent of our [[state]]. what hath been seen,
either in snuffs and packings of the dukes;
or the hard rein which both of them have borne
against the old [[kind]] [[king]]; or something deeper,
whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings;—
but, true it is, from [[france]] there comes a power
into this scatter’d [[kingdom]]; who already,
wise in our negligence, have secret feet
in some of our [[best]] ports, and are at point
to show their open banner.—now to you:
if on my credit you dare build so far
to make your speed to dover, you shall find
some that will thank you making just report
of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
the [[king]] hath cause to plain.
i am a gentleman of [[blood]] and breeding;
and from some [[knowledge]] and assurance
offer this office to you.

gentleman.
i will talk further with you.

kent.
no, do not.
for confirmation that i am much more
than my out-wall, open this purse, and take
what it contains. if you shall see cordelia,
as [[fear]] not but you shall, show her this ring;
and she will tell you who your fellow is
that yet you do not [[know]]. fie on this storm!
i will go seek the [[king]].

gentleman.
give me your hand: have you no more to say?

kent.
few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:
that, when we have found the [[king]], in which your pain
that way, i’ll this; he that first lights [[light]] on him
holla the other.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. another part of the heath.

 storm continues. enter lear
and [[fool]].

lear.
blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
you cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
till you have drench’d our steeples, drown’d the cocks!
you sulphurous and thought-executing fires [[fire]],
vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
singe my [[white]] head! and thou, all-shaking thunder,
strike flat the thick rotundity o’ the world!
crack nature’s moulds, all germens spill at once,
that make ingrateful man!

fool.
o nuncle, court holy-water in a dry house is [[better]] than this
rain-water out o’ door. [[good]] nuncle, in; and ask thy daughters
blessing: here’s a night pities neither [[wise]] [[men]] nor fools [[fool]].

lear.
rumble thy bellyful! spit, fire! spout, rain!
nor rain, wind, thunder, [[fire]] are my daughters [[daughter]];
i tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.
i never gave you [[kingdom]], call’d you [[children]];
you owe me no subscription: then let fall
your horrible [[pleasure]]. here i stand your [[slave]],
a [[poor]], infirm, [[weak]], and despis’d old [[man]]:
but yet i call you servile ministers,
that will with two pernicious daughters [[daughter]] join
your high-engender’d battles [[battle]] ’gainst a head
so old and [[white]] as this! o! o! ’tis foul!

fool.
he that has a house to put’s head in has a [[good]] head-piece.
   the codpiece that will house
     before the head has any,
   the head and he shall louse:
     so beggars [[marry]] many.
   the [[man]] that makes his toe
     what he his [[heart]] should make
   shall of a corn cry woe,
     and turn his sleep to wake.
for there was never yet [[fair]] woman but she made mouths in a glass.

lear.
no, i will be the pattern of all patience;
i will say nothing.

 enter kent.

kent.
who’s there?

fool.
marry, here’s grace and a codpiece; that’s a [[wise]] [[man]] and a
fool.

kent.
alas, sir, are you here? things that [[love]] night
love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies
gallow the very wanderers of the dark,
and make them keep their caves. since i was [[man]],
such sheets of [[fire]], such bursts of horrid thunder,
such groans of roaring wind and rain i never
remember to have heard. man’s [[nature]] cannot carry
th’affliction, nor the [[fear]].

lear.
let the [[great]] gods,
that keep this dreadful pudder o’er our heads,
find out their enemies [[enemy]] now. tremble, thou wretch,
that hast within thee undivulged crimes
unwhipp’d of [[justice]]. hide thee, thou bloody hand;
thou perjur’d, and thou simular of virtue
that art [[arts]] incestuous. caitiff, to pieces shake
that under covert and convenient seeming
hast practis’d on man’s [[life]]: close pent-up guilts,
rive your concealing continents, and cry
these dreadful summoners grace. i am a man
more sinn’d against than sinning.

kent.
alack, bareheaded!
gracious my [[lord]], hard by here is a hovel;
some [[friendship]] will it lend you ’gainst the tempest:
repose you there, whilst i to this hard house,—
more harder than the stones whereof ’tis rais’d;
which even but now, demanding after you,
denied me to come in,—return, and force
their scanted courtesy.

lear.
my wits begin to turn.
come on, my boy. how dost, my boy? art [[arts]] cold?
i am cold myself. where is this straw, my fellow?
the art [[arts]] of our necessities is [[strange]],
that can make vile things precious. come, your hovel.
poor [[fool]] and knave, i have one part in my heart
that’s [[sorry]] yet for thee.

fool.
[_singing._]
   he that has and a little tiny wit,
     with heigh-ho, the wind and the rain,
   must make content with his fortunes [[fortune]] fit,
     though the rain it raineth every day.

lear.
true, boy. come, bring us to this hovel.

 [_exeunt lear and kent._]

fool.
this is a brave night to cool a courtezan. i’ll speak a prophecy
ere i go:
   when priests [[priest]] are more in word than matter;
   when brewers mar their malt with water;
   when nobles [[noble]] are their tailors’ tutors;
   no heretics burn’d, but wenches’ suitors;
   when every case in [[law]] is [[right]];
   no squire in debt, nor no [[poor]] knight;
   when slanders do not [[live]] in tongues;
   nor cut-purses come not to throngs;
   when usurers tell their gold i’ the field;
   and bawds and whores do churches [[church]] build,
   then shall the realm of albion
   come to [[great]] confusion:
   then comes the [[time]], who lives [[life]] to see’t,
   that going shall be us’d with feet.
this prophecy merlin shall make; for i [[live]] before his [[time]].

 [_exit._]

scene iii. a room in gloucester’s castle.

 enter gloucester and edmund.

gloucester.
alack, alack, edmund, i like not this unnatural dealing. when i
desired their leave that i might [[pity]] him, they took from me the
use of mine own house; charged me on [[pain]] of perpetual displeasure,
neither to speak of him, entreat for him, or any way sustain him.

edmund.
most savage and unnatural!

gloucester.
go to; say you nothing. there is division between the dukes,
and a worse matter than that: i have received a letter this
night;—’tis dangerous to be spoken;—i have locked the letter
in my closet: these injuries the [[king]] now bears will be revenged
home; there’s part of a [[power]] already footed: we must incline to
the [[king]]. i will look him, and privily relieve him: go you and
maintain talk with the duke, that my charity be not of him
perceived: if he ask for me, i am ill, and gone to bed. if i
die for it, as no less is threatened me, the [[king]] my old master
must be relieved. there is some [[strange]] thing toward, edmund;
pray you be careful.

 [_exit._]

edmund.
this courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke
instantly [[know]]; and of that letter too.
this seems a [[fair]] deserving, and must draw me
that which my [[father]] loses, no less than all:
the younger rises when the old doth fall.

 [_exit._]

scene iv. a part of the heath with a hovel.

 storm continues. enter lear,
kent and [[fool]].

kent.
here is the place, my [[lord]]; [[good]] my [[lord]], enter:
the [[tyranny]] of the open night’s too rough
for [[nature]] to endure.

lear.
let me alone.

kent.
good my [[lord]], enter here.

lear.
wilt break my [[heart]]?

kent.
i had rather break mine own. [[good]] my [[lord]], enter.

lear.
thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm
invades us to the skin: so ’tis to thee,
but where the greater malady is fix’d,
the lesser is scarce [[felt]]. thou’dst shun a bear;
but if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
thou’dst meet the bear i’ the mouth. when the mind’s
free,
the body’s delicate: the tempest in my mind
doth from my senses take all feeling else
save what beats there. filial ingratitude!
is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
for lifting food to’t? but i will punish [[home]];
no, i will weep no more. in such a night
to shut me out! pour on; i will endure:
in such a night as this! o regan, goneril!
your old [[kind]] [[father]], whose frank [[heart]] gave all,
o, that way madness lies [[lie]]; let me shun that;
no more of that.

kent.
good my [[lord]], enter here.

lear.
prythee go in thyself; seek thine own ease:
this tempest will not give me leave to ponder
on things would hurt me more. but i’ll go in.
[_to the [[fool]]._] in, boy; go first. you houseless [[poverty]],
nay, get thee in. i’ll [[pray]], and then i’ll sleep.

 [_fool goes in._]

poor naked wretches, wheresoe’er you are,
that bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
how shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
your loop’d and window’d raggedness, defend you
from seasons such as these? o, i have ta’en
too little [[care]] of this! take physic, pomp;
expose thyself to [[feel]] what wretches [[feel]],
that thou mayst shake the superflux to them
and show the heavens [[heaven]] more just.

edgar.
[_within._] fathom and half, fathom and half! [[poor]] tom!

 [_the [[fool]] runs out from the hovel._]

fool.
come not in here, nuncle, here’s a spirit.
help me, [[help]] me!

kent.
give me thy hand. who’s there?

fool.
a spirit, a spirit: he says his name’s [[poor]] tom.

kent.
what art [[arts]] thou that dost grumble there i’ the straw?
come forth.

 enter edgar, disguised as a
madman.

edgar.
away! the foul fiend follows me! through the sharp hawthorn blows the
cold wind. humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.

lear.
didst thou give all to thy two daughters [[daughter]]?
and art [[arts]] thou come to this?

edgar.
who gives anything to [[poor]] tom? whom the foul fiend hath led
through [[fire]] and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o’er
bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and
halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge; made him proud
of [[heart]], to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inched
bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. bless thy five
wits! 	tom’s a-cold. o, do, de, do, de, do, de. bless thee from
whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! do [[poor]] tom some charity,
whom the foul fiend vexes. there could i have him now, and
there,—and there again, and there.

 [_storm continues._]

lear.
what, have his daughters [[daughter]] brought him to this pass?
couldst thou save nothing? didst thou give ’em all?

fool.
nay, he reserv’d a blanket, else we had been all shamed.

lear.
now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
hang fated o’er [[men’s]] faults [[fault]] [[light]] on thy daughters!

kent.
he hath no daughters [[daughter]], sir.

lear.
death, traitor! nothing could have subdu’d nature
to such a lowness but his unkind daughters [[daughter]].
is it the [[fashion]] that discarded fathers
should have thus little [[mercy]] on their flesh?
judicious punishment! ’twas this flesh begot
those pelican daughters [[daughter]].

edgar.
   pillicock sat on pillicock hill,
     alow, alow, loo loo!

fool.
this cold night will turn us all to fools [[fool]] and madmen.

edgar.
take heed o’ th’ foul fiend: obey thy parents; keep thy word
justly; swear not; commit not with man’s sworn spouse; set not
thy sweet-heart on proud array. tom’s a-cold.

lear.
what hast thou been?

edgar.
a serving-man, proud in [[heart]] and [[mind]]; that curled my hair;
wore gloves in my cap; served the [[lust]] of my mistress’ [[heart]], and
did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as i spake
words, and broke them in the sweet face of [[heaven]]. one that
slept in the contriving of [[lust]], and waked to do it. wine loved
i deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour’d the turk.
false of [[heart]], [[light]] of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox
in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray
thy [[poor]] [[heart]] to woman. keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand
out of plackets, thy pen from lender’s [[book]], and defy the foul
fiend. still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind: says
suum, mun, nonny. dolphin my boy, boy, sessa! let him trot by.

 [_storm still continues._]

lear.
why, thou wert [[better]] in thy grave than to [[answer]] with thy uncovered
body this extremity of the skies [[sky]]. is [[man]] no more than this? consider
him well. thou owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no
wool, the cat no perfume. ha! here’s three on’s are
sophisticated! thou art [[arts]] the thing itself: unaccommodated [[man]] is no more
but such a [[poor]], bare, forked animal as thou art [[arts]]. off, off, you
lendings! come, unbutton here.

 [_tears off his clothes._]

fool.
prythee, nuncle, be contented; ’tis a naughty night to swim
in. now a little [[fire]] in a wild field were like an old lecher’s
heart, a small spark, all the rest on’s [[body]] cold. look, here
comes a walking [[fire]].

edgar.
this is the foul fiend flibbertigibbet: he begins at curfew, and walks
till the first cock; he gives the web and the pin, squints the eye, and
makes the harelip; mildews the [[white]] wheat, and hurts the [[poor]] creature
of [[earth]].
   swithold footed thrice the old;
   he met the nightmare, and her nine-fold;
     bid her alight and her troth plight,
   and aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!

kent.
how fares your grace?

 enter gloucester with a
torch.

lear.
what’s he?

kent.
who’s there? what is’t you seek?

gloucester.
what are you there? your names?

edgar.
poor tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the todpole, the
wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his [[heart]], when the
foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat
and the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the standing pool;
who is whipped from tithing to tithing, and stocked, punished,
and imprisoned; who hath had three suits to his back, six shirts
to his [[body]],
     horse to ride, and weapon to wear.
     but mice and rats and such small deer,
     have been tom’s food for seven long year.
beware my follower. [[peace]], smulkin; [[peace]], thou fiend!

gloucester.
what, hath your grace no [[better]] company?

edgar.
the [[prince]] of darkness is a gentleman:
modo he’s call’d, and mahu.

gloucester.
our flesh and [[blood]], my [[lord]], is grown so vile
that it doth hate what gets it.

edgar.
poor tom’s a-cold.

gloucester.
go in with me: my [[duty]] cannot suffer
t’obey in all your daughters’ hard commands;
though their injunction be to bar my doors,
and let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
yet have i ventur’d to come seek you out,
and bring you where both [[fire]] and food is ready.

lear.
first let me talk with this philosopher.
what is the cause of thunder?

kent.
good my [[lord]], take his offer; go into the house.

lear.
i’ll talk a word with this same learned theban.
what is your study?

edgar.
how to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.

lear.
let me ask you one word in private.

kent.
importune him once more to go, my [[lord]];
his wits begin t’unsettle.

gloucester.
canst thou blame him?
his daughters [[daughter]] seek his [[death]]. ah, that [[good]] kent!
he said it would be thus, [[poor]] banish’d man!
thou sayest the [[king]] grows mad; i’ll tell thee, friend,
i am almost mad myself. i had a [[son]],
now outlaw’d from my [[blood]]; he sought my life
but lately, very late: i lov’d him, friend,
no [[father]] his [[son]] dearer: true to tell thee,

 [_storm continues._]

the [[grief]] hath craz’d my wits. what a night’s this!
i do beseech your grace.

lear.
o, cry you [[mercy]], sir.
noble philosopher, your company.

edgar.
tom’s a-cold.

gloucester.
in, fellow, there, into the hovel; keep thee warm.

lear.
come, let’s in all.

kent.
this way, my [[lord]].

lear.
with him;
i will keep still with my philosopher.

kent.
good my [[lord]], soothe him; let him take the fellow.

gloucester.
take him you on.

kent.
sirrah, come on; go along with us.

lear.
come, [[good]] athenian.

gloucester.
no words, no words, hush.

edgar.
   child rowland to the dark tower came,
   his word was still—fie, foh, and fum,
   i smell the [[blood]] of a british [[man]].

 [_exeunt._]

scene v. a room in gloucester’s castle.

 enter cornwall and edmund.

cornwall.
i will have my [[revenge]] ere i depart his house.

edmund.
how, my [[lord]], i may be censured, that [[nature]] thus gives way to
loyalty, something fears [[fear]] me to [[think]] of.

cornwall.
i now perceive it was not altogether your brother’s evil
disposition made him seek his [[death]]; but a provoking [[merit]], set
a-work by a reproveable badness in himself.

edmund.
how malicious is my [[fortune]], that i must repent to be just! this
is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an intelligent
party to the advantages of [[france]]. o heavens! that this treason
were not; or not i the detector!

cornwall.
go with me to the duchess.

edmund.
if the matter of this paper be [[certain]], you have mighty business
in hand.

cornwall.
true or false, it hath made thee earl of gloucester. seek out
where thy [[father]] is, that he may be ready for our apprehension.

edmund.
[_aside._] if i find him comforting the [[king]], it will stuff his
suspicion more fully. i will persever in my course of loyalty,
though the conflict be sore between that and my [[blood]].

cornwall.
i will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a dearer father
in my [[love]].

 [_exeunt._]

scene vi. a chamber in a farmhouse adjoining the castle.

 enter gloucester, lear, kent,
fool and edgar.

gloucester.
here is [[better]] than the open air; take it thankfully. i will
piece out the comfort with what addition i can: i will not be
long from you.

kent.
all the [[power]] of his wits have given way to his [[impatience]]:—
the gods [[reward]] your kindness!

 [_exit gloucester._]

edgar.
frateretto calls me; and tells me nero is an angler in the lake
of darkness. [[pray]], [[innocent]], and beware the foul fiend.

fool.
prythee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a
yeoman.

lear.
a [[king]], a king!

fool.
no, he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his [[son]]; for he’s a mad
yeoman that sees his [[son]] a gentleman before him.

lear.
to have a thousand with red burning spits
come hissing in upon ’em.

edgar.
the foul fiend bites my back.

fool.
he’s mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse’s health,
a boy’s [[love]], or a whore’s oath.

lear.
it shall be done; i will arraign them straight.
[_to edgar._] come, sit thou here, most learned justicer;
[_to the [[fool]]._] thou, sapient sir, sit here. now, you she-foxes!—

edgar.
look, where he stands and glares! want’st thou [[eyes]] at [[trial]], madam?
  come o’er the bourn, bessy, to me.

fool.
   her boat hath a leak,
   and she must not speak
   why she dares not come over to thee.

edgar.
the foul fiend haunts [[poor]] tom in the voice of a nightingale.
hoppedance cries in tom’s belly for two [[white]] herring. croak not, black
angel; i have no food for thee.

kent.
how do you, sir? stand you not so amaz’d;
will you [[lie]] down and rest upon the cushions?

lear.
i’ll see their [[trial]] first. bring in their evidence.
[_to edgar._] thou, robed [[man]] of [[justice]], take thy place.
[_to the [[fool]]._] and thou, his yokefellow of equity,
bench by his side. [_to kent._] you are o’ the commission,
sit you too.

edgar.
   let us deal justly.
   sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
     thy sheep be in the corn;
   and for one blast of thy minikin mouth
     thy sheep shall take no harm.
purr! the cat is grey.

lear.
arraign her first; ’tis goneril. i here take my oath before
this honourable assembly, she kicked the [[poor]] [[king]] her [[father]].

fool.
come hither, mistress. is your name goneril?

lear.
she cannot deny it.

fool.
cry you [[mercy]], i took you for a joint-stool.

lear.
and here’s another, whose warp’d looks proclaim
what store her [[heart]] is made on. stop her there!
arms, arms! sword! fire! [[corruption]] in the place!
false justicer, why hast thou let her ’scape?

edgar.
bless thy five wits!

kent.
o pity! sir, where is the patience now
that you so oft have boasted to retain?

edgar.
[_aside._] my tears begin to take his part so much
they mar my counterfeiting.

lear.
the little dogs and all,
trey, blanch, and sweetheart, see, they bark at me.

edgar.
tom will throw his head at them. avaunt, you curs!
   be thy mouth or black or [[white]],
   tooth that poisons if it bite;
   mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,
   hound or spaniel, brach or him,
   or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,
   tom will make them weep and wail;
   for, with throwing thus my head,
   dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
do, de, de, de. sessa! come, march to wakes and fairs and market towns.
poor tom, thy horn is dry.

lear.
then let them anatomize regan; see what breeds about her
heart. is there any cause in [[nature]] that makes these hard
hearts? [_to edgar._] you, sir, i entertain you for one of my
hundred; only i do not like the [[fashion]] of your garments. you’ll
say they are persian; but let them be changed.

kent.
now, [[good]] my [[lord]], [[lie]] here and rest awhile.

lear.
make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains.
so, so. we’ll go to supper i’ the morning.

fool.
and i’ll go to bed at noon.

 enter gloucester.

gloucester.
come hither, friend;
where is the [[king]] my master?

kent.
here, sir; but trouble him not, his wits are gone.

gloucester.
good friend, i prythee, take him in thy arms;
i have o’erheard a plot of [[death]] upon him;
there is a litter ready; lay him in’t
and drive towards dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
both welcome and protection. take up thy master;
if thou shouldst dally half an hour, his [[life]],
with thine, and all that offer to defend him,
stand in assured loss. take up, take up;
and [[follow]] me, that will to some provision
give thee quick conduct.

kent.
oppressed [[nature]] sleeps.
this rest might yet have balm’d thy broken sinews,
which, if convenience will not allow,
stand in hard cure. come, [[help]] to bear thy master;
[_to the [[fool]]._] thou must not stay behind.

gloucester.
come, come, away!

 [_exeunt kent, gloucester and the [[fool]] bearing off lear._]

edgar.
when we our betters see bearing our woes,
we scarcely [[think]] our miseries our foes.
who alone suffers, suffers most i’ the [[mind]],
leaving [[free]] things and [[happy]] shows behind:
but then the [[mind]] much sufferance doth o’erskip
when [[grief]] hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
how [[light]] and portable my [[pain]] seems now,
when that which makes me bend makes the [[king]] bow;
he childed as i fathered! tom, away!
mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,
when false [[opinion]], whose [[wrong]] thoughts [[thought]] defile thee,
in thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.
what will hap more tonight, safe ’scape the king!
lurk, lurk.

leave him to my displeasure. edmund, keep you our sister
company: the revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous
father are not fit for your beholding. advise the duke where you
are going, to a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the
like. our posts shall be swift and [[intelligent]] betwixt us.
farewell, dear sister, farewell, my [[lord]] of gloucester.

 enter oswald.

how now! where’s the [[king]]?

oswald.
my [[lord]] of gloucester hath convey’d him hence:
some five or six and thirty of his knights,
hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
who, with some other of the lord’s dependants,
are gone with him toward dover: where they boast
to have well-armed [[friends]].

cornwall.
get horses for your mistress.

goneril.
farewell, sweet [[lord]], and sister.

cornwall.
edmund, farewell.

 [_exeunt goneril, edmund and oswald._]

go seek the traitor gloucester,
pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.

 [_exeunt other servants._]

though well we may not pass upon his life
without the form of [[justice]], yet our power
shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men
may blame, but not control. who’s there? the traitor?

 enter gloucester
and servants.

regan.
ingrateful fox! ’tis he.

cornwall.
bind fast his corky arms.

gloucester.
what mean your graces?
good my [[friends]], consider you are my guests.
do me no foul play, [[friends]].

cornwall.
bind him, i say.

 [_servants bind him._]

regan.
hard, hard. o filthy traitor!

gloucester.
unmerciful [[lady]] as you are, i’m none.

cornwall.
to this chair bind him. villain, thou shalt find—

 [_regan plucks his beard._]

gloucester.
by the [[kind]] gods, ’tis most ignobly done
to pluck me by the beard.

regan.
so [[white]], and such a traitor!

gloucester.
naughty [[lady]],
these hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin
will quicken, and accuse thee. i am your host:
with robber’s hands my hospitable favours
you should not ruffle thus. what will you do?

cornwall.
come, sir, what letters had you late from [[france]]?

regan.
be simple answer’d, for we [[know]] the [[truth]].

cornwall.
and what confederacy have you with the traitors,
late footed in the [[kingdom]]?

regan.
to whose hands have you sent the lunatic [[king]]?
speak.

gloucester.
i have a letter guessingly set down,
which came from one that’s of a neutral [[heart]],
and not from one oppos’d.

cornwall.
cunning.

regan.
and false.

cornwall.
where hast thou sent the [[king]]?

gloucester.
to dover.

regan.
wherefore to dover? wast thou not charg’d at peril,—

cornwall.
wherefore to dover? let him first [[answer]] that.

gloucester.
i am tied to the stake, and i must stand the course.

regan.
wherefore to dover, sir?

gloucester.
because i would not see thy cruel nails
pluck out his [[poor]] old [[eyes]]; nor thy fierce sister
in his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
the sea, with such a storm as his bare head
in hell-black night endur’d, would have buoy’d up,
and quench’d the stelled fires [[fire]];
yet, [[poor]] old [[heart]], he holp the heavens [[heaven]] to rain.
if wolves had at thy gate howl’d that stern [[time]],
thou shouldst have said, ‘good porter, turn the key.’
all cruels else subscrib’d: but i shall see
the winged vengeance overtake such [[children]].

cornwall.
see’t shalt thou never. fellows, hold the chair.
upon these [[eyes]] of thine i’ll set my foot.

 [_gloucester is held down in his chair, while cornwall plucks out one
 of his [[eyes]] and sets his foot on it._]

gloucester.
he that will [[think]] to [[live]] till he be old,
give me some help!—o cruel! o you gods!

regan.
one side will mock another; the other too!

cornwall.
if you see vengeance—

first servant.
hold your hand, my [[lord]]:
i have serv’d you ever since i was a child;
but [[better]] service have i never done you
than now to bid you hold.

regan.
how now, you dog!

first servant.
if you did wear a beard upon your chin,
i’d shake it on this quarrel. what do you mean?

cornwall.
my villain?

 [_draws, and runs at him._]

first servant.
nay, then, come on, and take the [[chance]] of anger.

 [_draws. they [[fight]]. cornwall is wounded._]

regan.
[_to another servant._] give me thy [[sword]]. a peasant stand up thus?

 [_snatches a [[sword]], comes behind, and stabs him._]

first servant.
o, i am slain! my [[lord]], you have one eye left
to see some mischief on him. o!

 [_dies._]

cornwall.
lest it see more, prevent it. out, vile jelly!
where is thy lustre now?

 [_tears out gloucester’s other eye and throws it on the ground._]

gloucester.
all dark and comfortless. where’s my [[son]] edmund?
edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature
to quit this horrid act.

regan.
out, [[treacherous]] villain!
thou call’st on him that hates thee: it was he
that made the overture of thy treasons to us;
who is too [[good]] to [[pity]] thee.

gloucester.
o my follies! then edgar was abus’d.
kind gods, [[forgive]] me that, and [[prosper]] him!

regan.
go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
his way to dover. how is’t, my [[lord]]? how look you?

cornwall.
i have receiv’d a hurt: [[follow]] me, [[lady]].
turn out that eyeless villain. throw this slave
upon the dunghill. regan, i bleed apace:
untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.

 [_exit cornwall, [[led]] by regan; servants unbind gloucester and lead
 him out._]

second servant.
i’ll never [[care]] what wickedness i do,
if this [[man]] come to [[good]].

third servant.
if she [[live]] long,
and in the end meet the old course of [[death]],
women will all turn monsters.

second servant.
let’s [[follow]] the old earl, and get the bedlam
to lead him where he would: his roguish madness
allows itself to anything.

third servant.
go thou: i’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
to apply to his bleeding face. now [[heaven]] [[help]] him!

act iv

scene i. the heath.

 enter edgar.

edgar.
yet [[better]] thus, and known to be contemn’d,
than still contemn’d and flatter’d. to be worst,
the lowest and most dejected thing of [[fortune]],
stands still in esperance, lives [[life]] not in [[fear]]:
the lamentable [[change]] is from the [[best]];
the worst returns to laughter. welcome then,
thou unsubstantial air that i embrace;
the wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
owes nothing to thy blasts.

 enter gloucester, [[led]] by an
old [[man]].

but who comes here? my [[father]], poorly [[led]]?
world, [[world]], o world!
but that thy [[strange]] mutations make us hate thee,
life would not yield to [[age]].

old [[man]].
o my [[good]] [[lord]], i have been your tenant, and your father’s tenant
these fourscore years.

gloucester.
away, get thee away; [[good]] friend, be gone.
thy comforts can do me no [[good]] at all;
thee they may hurt.

old [[man]].
you cannot see your way.

gloucester.
i have no way, and therefore want no [[eyes]];
i stumbled when i saw. full oft ’tis seen
our means secure us, and our mere defects
prove our commodities. o dear [[son]] edgar,
the food of thy abused father’s wrath!
might i but [[live]] to see thee in my touch,
i’d say i had [[eyes]] again!

old [[man]].
how now! who’s there?

edgar.
[_aside._] o gods! who is’t can say ‘i am at the
worst’?
i am worse than e’er i was.

old [[man]].
’tis [[poor]] mad tom.

edgar.
[_aside._] and worse i may be yet. the worst is not
so long as we can say ‘this is the worst.’

old [[man]].
fellow, where goest?

gloucester.
is it a beggar-man?

old [[man]].
madman, and beggar too.

gloucester.
he has some [[reason]], else he could not beg.
i’ the [[last]] night’s storm i such a fellow saw;
which made me [[think]] a [[man]] a worm. my son
came then into my [[mind]], and yet my mind
was then scarce [[friends]] with him.
i have heard more since.
as flies to wanton boys are we to the gods,
they kill us for their [[sport]].

edgar.
[_aside._] how should this be?
bad is the [[trade]] that must play [[fool]] to [[sorrow]],
angering itself and others. bless thee, master!

gloucester.
is that the naked fellow?

old [[man]].
ay, my [[lord]].

gloucester.
then prythee get thee away. if for my sake
thou wilt o’ertake us hence a mile or twain,
i’ the way toward dover, do it for ancient [[love]],
and bring some covering for this naked [[soul]],
which i’ll entreat to lead me.

old [[man]].
alack, sir, he is mad.

gloucester.
’tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind.
do as i bid thee, or rather do thy [[pleasure]];
above the rest, be gone.

old [[man]].
i’ll bring him the [[best]] ’parel that i have,
come on’t what will.

 [_exit._]

gloucester.
sirrah naked fellow.

edgar.
poor tom’s a-cold.
[_aside._] i cannot daub it further.

gloucester.
come hither, fellow.

edgar.
[_aside._] and yet i must. bless thy sweet [[eyes]], they bleed.

gloucester.
know’st thou the way to dover?

edgar.
both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. [[poor]] tom hath been
scared out of his [[good]] wits. bless thee, [[good]] man’s [[son]], from
the foul fiend! five fiends have been in [[poor]] tom at once; of
lust, as obidicut; hobbididence, [[prince]] of darkness; mahu, of
stealing; modo, of murder; flibbertigibbet, of mopping and
mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting [[women]]. so,
bless thee, master!

gloucester.
here, take this purse, thou whom the heaven’s plagues
have humbled to all strokes: that i am wretched
makes thee the happier. heavens [[heaven]] deal so still!
let the superfluous and lust-dieted [[man]],
that slaves [[slave]] your ordinance, that will not see
because he does not [[feel]], [[feel]] your [[power]] quickly;
so distribution should undo excess,
and each [[man]] have enough. dost thou [[know]] dover?

edgar.
ay, master.

gloucester.
there is a cliff, whose high and bending head
looks fearfully in the confined deep:
bring me but to the very brim of it,
and i’ll repair the misery thou dost bear
with something [[rich]] about me: from that place
i shall no leading need.

edgar.
give me thy arm:
poor tom shall lead thee.

scene ii. before the duke of albany’s palace.

 enter goneril, edmund;
oswald meeting them.

goneril.
welcome, my [[lord]]. i marvel our mild husband
not met us on the way. now, where’s your master?

oswald.
madam, within; but never [[man]] so chang’d.
i told him of the [[army]] that was landed;
he smil’d at it: i told him you were coming;
his [[answer]] was, ‘the worse.’ of gloucester’s treachery
and of the [[loyal]] service of his son
when i inform’d him, then he call’d me sot,
and told me i had turn’d the [[wrong]] side out.
what most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
what like, offensive.

goneril.
[_to edmund._] then shall you go no further.
it is the cowish terror of his spirit,
that dares not undertake. he’ll not [[feel]] wrongs
which tie him to an [[answer]]. our wishes [[wish]] on the way
may prove effects. back, edmund, to my [[brother]];
hasten his musters and conduct his powers [[power]].
i must [[change]] names at [[home]], and give the distaff
into my husband’s hands. this trusty servant
shall pass between us. ere long you are like to hear,
if you dare venture in your own behalf,
a mistress’s command. [_giving a favour._]
wear this; spare [[speech]];
decline your head. this kiss, if it durst speak,
would stretch thy spirits up into the air.
conceive, and fare thee well.

edmund.
yours in the ranks of [[death]].

 [_exit edmund._]

goneril.
my most dear gloucester.
o, the difference of [[man]] and man!
to thee a woman’s services are due;
my [[fool]] usurps my [[body]].

oswald.
madam, here comes my [[lord]].

 [_exit._]

 enter albany.

goneril.
i have been worth the whistle.

albany.
o goneril!
you are not worth the dust which the rude wind
blows in your face! i [[fear]] your disposition;
that [[nature]] which contemns its origin
cannot be bordered [[certain]] in itself.
she that herself will sliver and disbranch
from her material sap, perforce must wither
and come to deadly use.

goneril.
no more; the text is foolish.

albany.
wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;
filths savour but themselves. what have you done?
tigers, not daughters [[daughter]], what have you perform’d?
a [[father]], and a gracious aged [[man]],
whose reverence even the head-lugg’d bear would lick,
most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.
could my [[good]] [[brother]] suffer you to do it?
a [[man]], a [[prince]], by him so benefitted!
if that the heavens [[heaven]] do not their visible spirits
send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
it will come,
humanity must perforce prey on itself,
like monsters of the deep.

goneril.
milk-liver’d man!
that bear’st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs [[wrong]];
who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
thine [[honour]] from thy suffering; that not know’st
fools do those villains [[pity]] who are punish’d
ere they have done their mischief. where’s thy drum?
france spreads his banners in our noiseless [[land]];
with plumed helm thy [[state]] begins to threat,
whilst thou, a [[moral]] [[fool]], sitt’st still, and criest
‘alack, why does he so?’

albany.
see thyself, devil!
proper deformity seems not in the fiend
so horrid as in woman.

goneril.
o [[vain]] fool!

albany.
thou changed and self-cover’d thing, for shame!
be-monster not thy feature! were’t my fitness
to let these hands obey my [[blood]].
they are apt enough to dislocate and tear
thy flesh and bones. howe’er thou art [[arts]] a fiend,
a woman’s shape doth shield thee.

goneril.
marry, your manhood, mew!

 enter a messenger.

albany.
what news?

messenger.
o, my [[good]] [[lord]], the duke of cornwall’s [[dead]];
slain by his servant, going to put out
the other eye of gloucester.

albany.
gloucester’s eyes!

messenger.
a servant that he bred, thrill’d with remorse,
oppos’d against the act, bending his sword
to his [[great]] master; who, thereat enrag’d,
flew on him, and amongst them fell’d him [[dead]];
but not without that harmful stroke which since
hath pluck’d him after.

albany.
this shows you are above,
you justicers, that these our nether crimes
so speedily can venge! but, o [[poor]] gloucester!
lost he his other eye?

messenger.
both, both, my [[lord]].
this letter, madam, craves a speedy [[answer]];
’tis from your sister.

goneril.
[_aside._] one way i like this well;
but being widow, and my gloucester with her,
may all the building in my fancy pluck
upon my hateful [[life]]. another way
the news is not so tart. i’ll [[read]], and [[answer]].

 [_exit._]

albany.
where was his [[son]] when they did take his [[eyes]]?

messenger.
come with my [[lady]] hither.

albany.
he is not here.

messenger.
no, my [[good]] [[lord]]; i met him back again.

albany.
knows he the wickedness?

messenger.
ay, my [[good]] [[lord]]. ’twas he inform’d against him;
and quit the house on [[purpose]], that their punishment
might have the freer course.

albany.
gloucester, i live
to thank thee for the [[love]] thou show’dst the [[king]],
and to [[revenge]] thine [[eyes]]. come hither, friend,
tell me what more thou know’st.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. the french camp near dover.

 enter kent and a gentleman.

kent.
why the [[king]] of [[france]] is so suddenly gone back, [[know]] you no
reason?

gentleman.
something he left imperfect in the [[state]], which since his coming
forth is [[thought]] of, which imports to the [[kingdom]] so much fear
and danger that his personal return was most required and
necessary.

kent.
who hath he left behind him general?

gentleman.
the mareschal of [[france]], monsieur la far.

kent.
did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of [[grief]]?

gentleman.
ay, sir; she took them, [[read]] them in my presence;
and now and then an ample tear trill’d down
her delicate cheek. it seem’d she was a queen
over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
sought to be [[king]] o’er her.

kent.
o, then it mov’d her.

gentleman.
not to a rage: patience and [[sorrow]] strove
who should express her goodliest. you have seen
sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
were like a [[better]] day. those [[happy]] smilets
that play’d on her ripe lip seem’d not to know
what guests were in her [[eyes]]; which parted thence
as pearls from diamonds dropp’d. in brief,
sorrow would be a rarity most belov’d,
if all could so become it.

kent.
made she no verbal [[question]]?

gentleman.
faith, once or twice she heav’d the name of ‘father’
pantingly forth, as if it press’d her [[heart]];
cried ‘sisters, sisters! shame of ladies! sisters!
kent! father! sisters! what, i’ the storm? i’ the night?
let [[pity]] not be believ’d!’ there she shook
the holy water from her heavenly [[eyes]],
and clamour master’d her: then away she started
to deal with [[grief]] alone.

kent.
it is the stars,
the stars above us govern our conditions;
else one [[self]] mate and make could not beget
such different issues. you spoke not with her since?

gentleman.
no.

kent.
was this before the [[king]] return’d?

gentleman.
no, since.

kent.
well, sir, the [[poor]] distressed lear’s i’ the town;
who sometime, in his [[better]] tune, remembers
what we are come about, and by no means
will yield to see his [[daughter]].

gentleman.
why, [[good]] sir?

kent.
a [[sovereign]] shame so elbows him. his own unkindness,
that stripp’d her from his benediction, turn’d her
to [[foreign]] casualties, gave her dear rights
to his dog-hearted daughters [[daughter]], these things sting
his [[mind]] so venomously that burning shame
detains him from cordelia.

gentleman.
alack, [[poor]] gentleman!

kent.
of albany’s and cornwall’s powers [[power]] you heard not?

gentleman.
’tis so; they are afoot.

kent.
well, sir, i’ll bring you to our master lear
and leave you to attend him. some dear cause
will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
when i am known aright, you shall not grieve
lending me this acquaintance.
i [[pray]] you, go along with me.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iv. the french camp. a tent.

 enter with drum and colours, cordelia, physician
and soldiers.

cordelia.
alack, ’tis he: why, he was met even now
as mad as the vex’d sea; singing aloud;
crown’d with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,
with harlocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
in our sustaining corn. a century send forth;
search every acre in the high-grown field,
and bring him to our eye.

 [_exit an officer._]

what can man’s wisdom
in the restoring his bereaved sense,
he that helps him take all my outward worth.

physician.
there is means, madam:
our foster nurse of [[nature]] is repose,
the which he lacks; that to provoke in him
are many simples operative, whose power
will close the eye of anguish.

cordelia.
all bless’d secrets,
all you unpublish’d virtues [[virtue]] of the [[earth]],
spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
in the [[good]] man’s distress! seek, seek for him;
lest his ungovern’d rage dissolve the life
that wants the means to lead it.

 enter a messenger.

messenger.
news, madam;
the british powers [[power]] are marching hitherward.

cordelia.
’tis known before. our preparation stands
in expectation of them. o dear [[father]],
it is thy [[business]] that i go about;
therefore [[great]] france
my mourning and important tears hath pitied.
no blown [[ambition]] doth our arms incite,
but [[love]], dear [[love]], and our ag’d father’s [[right]]:
soon may i hear and see him!

scene v. a room in gloucester’s castle.

 enter regan and oswald.

regan.
but are my brother’s powers [[power]] set forth?

oswald.
ay, madam.

regan.
himself in [[person]] there?

oswald.
madam, with much ado.
your sister is the [[better]] soldier.

regan.
lord edmund spake not with your [[lord]] at [[home]]?

oswald.
no, madam.

regan.
what might import my sister’s letter to him?

oswald.
i [[know]] not, [[lady]].

regan.
faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
it was [[great]] ignorance, gloucester’s [[eyes]] being out,
to let him [[live]]. where he arrives he moves
all hearts [[heart]] against us. edmund, i [[think]], is gone
in [[pity]] of his misery, to dispatch
his nighted [[life]]; moreover to descry
the [[strength]] o’ th’enemy.

oswald.
i must needs after him, madam, with my letter.

regan.
our [[troops]] set forth tomorrow; stay with us;
the ways are dangerous.

oswald.
i may not, madam:
my [[lady]] charg’d my [[duty]] in this [[business]].

regan.
why should she write to edmund? might not you
transport her purposes [[purpose]] by word? belike,
somethings, i [[know]] not what, i’ll [[love]] thee much.
let me unseal the letter.

oswald.
madam, i had rather—

regan.
i [[know]] your [[lady]] does not [[love]] her husband;
i am sure of that; and at her late being here
she gave [[strange]] oeillades and most speaking looks
to [[noble]] edmund. i [[know]] you are of her bosom.

oswald.
i, madam?

regan.
i speak in understanding; y’are, i know’t:
therefore i do advise you take this note:
my [[lord]] is [[dead]]; edmund and i have talk’d,
and more convenient is he for my hand
than for your lady’s. you may gather more.
if you do find him, [[pray]] you give him this;
and when your mistress hears thus much from you,
i [[pray]] [[desire]] her call her [[wisdom]] to her.
so, fare you well.
if you do [[chance]] to hear of that blind traitor,
preferment falls on him that cuts him off.

oswald.
would i could meet him, madam! i should show
what party i do [[follow]].

regan.
fare thee well.

 [_exeunt._]

scene vi. the [[country]] near dover.

 enter gloucester, and edgar  dressed like a peasant.

gloucester.
when shall i come to the top of that same hill?

edgar.
you do climb up it now. look how we [[labour]].

gloucester.
methinks the ground is even.

edgar.
horrible steep.
hark, do you hear the sea?

gloucester.
no, truly.

edgar.
why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
by your eyes’ anguish.

gloucester.
so may it be indeed.
methinks thy voice is alter’d; and thou speak’st
in [[better]] phrase and matter than thou didst.

edgar.
y’are much deceiv’d: in nothing am i chang’d
but in my garments.

gloucester.
methinks you’re [[better]] spoken.

edgar.
come on, sir; here’s the place. stand still. how fearful
and dizzy ’tis to cast one’s [[eyes]] so low!
the crows and choughs that wing the midway air
show scarce so gross as beetles. half way down
hangs one that gathers samphire—dreadful trade!
methinks he seems no bigger than his head.
the fishermen that walk upon the beach
appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
diminish’d to her cock; her cock a buoy
almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge
that on th’unnumber’d idle pebble chafes
cannot be heard so high. i’ll look no more;
lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
topple down headlong.

gloucester.
set me where you stand.

edgar.
give me your hand.
you are now within a foot of th’extreme verge.
for all beneath the moon would i not leap upright.

gloucester.
let go my hand.
here, friend, ’s another purse; in it a jewel
well worth a [[poor]] man’s taking. fairies and gods
prosper it with thee! go thou further off;
bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.

edgar.
now fare ye well, [[good]] sir.

 [_seems to go._]

gloucester.
with all my [[heart]].

edgar.
[_aside._] why i do trifle thus with his despair
is done to cure it.

gloucester.
o you mighty gods!
this [[world]] i do renounce, and in your sights,
shake patiently my [[great]] affliction off:
if i could bear it longer, and not fall
to quarrel with your [[great]] opposeless wills,
my snuff and loathed part of [[nature]] should
burn itself out. if edgar [[live]], o, bless him!
now, fellow, fare thee well.

edgar.
gone, sir, farewell.

 [_gloucester leaps, and falls along_]

and yet i [[know]] not how conceit may rob
the treasury of [[life]] when [[life]] itself
yields to the theft. had he been where he [[thought]],
by this had [[thought]] been [[past]]. alive or [[dead]]?
ho you, sir! friend! hear you, sir? speak!
thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
what are you, sir?

gloucester.
away, and let me [[die]].

edgar.
hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
so many fathom down precipitating,
thou’dst shiver’d like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
hast heavy substance; bleed’st not; speak’st; art [[arts]] sound.
ten masts at each make not the altitude
which thou hast perpendicularly fell.
thy [[life]] is a miracle. speak yet again.

gloucester.
but have i fall’n, or no?

edgar.
from the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
look up a-height, the shrill-gorg’d lark so far
cannot be seen or heard. do but look up.

gloucester.
alack, i have no [[eyes]].
is wretchedness depriv’d that benefit
to end itself by [[death]]? ’twas yet some comfort
when misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage
and frustrate his proud will.

edgar.
give me your arm.
up, so. how is’t? [[feel]] you your legs? you stand.

gloucester.
too well, too well.

edgar.
this is above all strangeness.
upon the [[crown]] o’ the cliff what thing was that
which parted from you?

gloucester.
a [[poor]] unfortunate beggar.

edgar.
as i stood here below, methought his eyes
were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
horns whelk’d and waved like the enraged sea.
it was some fiend. therefore, thou [[happy]] [[father]],
think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
of [[men’s]] impossibilities, have preserv’d thee.

gloucester.
i do [[remember]] now: henceforth i’ll bear
affliction till it do cry out itself
‘enough, enough,’ and [[die]]. that thing you speak of,
i took it for a [[man]]; often ’twould say,
‘the fiend, the fiend’; he [[led]] me to that place.

edgar.
bear [[free]] and patient thoughts [[thought]]. but who comes here?

 enter lear, fantastically
dressed up with flowers.

the safer sense will ne’er accommodate
his master thus.

lear.
no, they cannot touch me for coining. i am the [[king]] himself.

edgar.
o thou side-piercing sight!

lear.
nature’s above art [[arts]] in that [[respect]]. there’s your press [[money]].
that fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw me a clothier’s
yard. look, look, a mouse! [[peace]], [[peace]], this piece of toasted cheese
will do’t. there’s my gauntlet; i’ll prove it on a giant.
bring up the brown bills. o, well flown, bird! i’ the clout, i’
the clout. hewgh! give the word.

edgar.
sweet marjoram.

lear.
pass.

gloucester.
i [[know]] that voice.

lear.
ha! goneril with a [[white]] beard! they flattered me like a dog; and told
me i had [[white]] hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. to say
‘ay’ and ‘no’ to everything i said ‘ay’
and ‘no’ to was no [[good]] divinity. when the rain came to wet
me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not
peace at my bidding; there i found ’em, there i smelt ’em out.
go to, they are not [[men]] o’ their words: they told me i was everything;
’tis a [[lie]], i am not ague-proof.

gloucester.
the trick of that voice i do well [[remember]]:
is’t not the [[king]]?

lear.
ay, every inch a [[king]].
when i do stare, see how the [[subject]] quakes.
i pardon that man’s [[life]]. what was thy cause?
adultery? thou shalt not [[die]]: [[die]] for adultery! no:
the wren goes to’t, and the small gilded fly
does lecher in my sight. let copulation thrive;
for gloucester’s bastard [[son]] was kinder to his father
than my daughters [[daughter]] got ’tween the lawful sheets.
to’t, luxury, pell-mell! for i lack soldiers.
behold yond simp’ring dame,
whose face between her forks presages snow;
that minces [[virtue]], and does shake the head
to hear of pleasure’s name.
the fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to’t with a more riotous
appetite. down from the waist they are centaurs, though [[women]] all
above. but to the girdle do the gods inherit, beneath is all the
fiend’s; there’s hell, there’s darkness, there is the sulphurous pit;
burning, scalding, stench,
consumption. fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! give me an ounce of civet, good
apothecary, to sweeten my [[imagination]]. there’s [[money]] for thee.

gloucester.
o, let me kiss that hand!

lear.
let me wipe it first; it smells of [[mortality]].

gloucester.
o ruin’d piece of [[nature]], this [[great]] world
shall so wear out to naught. dost thou [[know]] me?

lear.
i [[remember]] thine [[eyes]] well enough. dost thou squiny at me?
no, do thy worst, blind cupid; i’ll not [[love]].
read thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it.

gloucester.
were all the letters suns, i could not see one.

edgar.
i would not take this from report,
it is, and my [[heart]] breaks at it.

lear.
read.

gloucester.
what, with the case of [[eyes]]?

lear.
o, ho, are you there with me? no [[eyes]] in your head, nor no money
in your purse? your [[eyes]] are in a heavy case, your purse in a
light, yet you see how this [[world]] goes.

gloucester.
i see it feelingly.

lear.
what, art [[arts]] mad? a [[man]] may see how the [[world]] goes with no [[eyes]].
look with thine ears. see how yon [[justice]] rails upon yon simple
thief. hark, in thine ear: [[change]] places; and, handy-dandy, which
is the [[justice]], which is the thief? thou hast seen a farmer’s
dog bark at a beggar?

gloucester.
ay, sir.

lear.
and the creature run from the cur? there thou mightst behold
the [[great]] image of [[authority]]: a dog’s obeyed in office.
thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
why dost thou lash that whore? strip thine own back;
thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind
for which thou whipp’st her. the usurer hangs the cozener.
through tatter’d clothes [[great]] vices [[vice]] do appear;
robes and furr’d gowns hide all. plate [[sin]] with gold,
and the [[strong]] lance of [[justice]] hurtless breaks;
arm it in rags, a pygmy’s straw does pierce it.
none does offend, none, i say none; i’ll able ’em;
take that of me, my friend, who have the power
to seal the accuser’s lips. get thee glass [[eyes]],
and like a scurvy politician, seem
to see the things thou dost not. now, now, now, now:
pull off my boots: harder, harder, so.

edgar.
o, matter and impertinency mix’d!
reason in madness!

lear.
if thou wilt weep my fortunes [[fortune]], take my [[eyes]].
i [[know]] thee well enough, thy name is gloucester.
thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
thou know’st the first [[time]] that we smell the air
we wawl and cry. i will preach to thee: mark.

gloucester.
alack, alack the day!

lear.
when we are born, we cry that we are come
to this [[great]] stage of fools [[fool]]. this a [[good]] block:
it were a delicate stratagem to shoe
a troop of horse with [[felt]]. i’ll put’t in proof
and when i have stol’n upon these son-in-laws,
then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

 enter a gentleman with
attendants.

gentleman.
o, here he is: lay hand upon him. sir,
your most dear daughter—

lear.
no rescue? what, a [[prisoner]]? i am even
the [[natural]] [[fool]] of [[fortune]]. use me well;
you shall have ransom. let me have surgeons;
i am cut to the brains.

gentleman.
you shall have anything.

lear.
no seconds? all myself?
why, this would make a [[man]] a [[man]] of salt,
to use his [[eyes]] for garden water-pots,
ay, and for laying autumn’s dust.

gentleman.
good sir.

lear.
i will [[die]] bravely, like a smug bridegroom.
what! i will be jovial. come, come,
i am a [[king]], my masters, [[know]] you that.

gentleman.
you are a [[royal]] one, and we obey you.

lear.
then there’s [[life]] in’t. come, and you get it,
you shall get it by running. sa, sa, sa, sa!

 [_exit running. attendants [[follow]]._]

gentleman.
a sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
past speaking of in a king! thou hast one daughter
who redeems [[nature]] from the general curse
which twain have brought her to.

edgar.
hail, gentle sir.

gentleman.
sir, speed you. what’s your will?

edgar.
do you hear aught, sir, of a [[battle]] toward?

gentleman.
most sure and vulgar.
everyone hears that, which can distinguish sound.

edgar.
but, by your favour,
how near’s the other [[army]]?

gentleman.
near and on speedy foot; the main descry
stands on the hourly [[thought]].

edgar.
i thank you sir, that’s all.

gentleman.
though that the queen on special cause is here,
her [[army]] is mov’d on.

edgar.
i thank you, sir.

 [_exit gentleman._]

gloucester.
you ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;
let not my worser spirit tempt me again
to [[die]] before you please.

edgar.
well [[pray]] you, [[father]].

gloucester.
now, [[good]] sir, what are you?

edgar.
a most [[poor]] [[man]], made tame to fortune’s blows;
who, by the art [[arts]] of known and feeling sorrows [[sorrow]],
am pregnant to [[good]] [[pity]]. give me your hand,
i’ll lead you to some biding.

gloucester.
hearty thanks:
the bounty and the benison of heaven
to boot, and boot.

 enter oswald.

oswald.
a proclaim’d prize! most happy!
that eyeless head of thine was first fram’d flesh
to raise my fortunes [[fortune]]. thou old unhappy traitor,
briefly thyself [[remember]]. the [[sword]] is out
that must [[destroy]] thee.

gloucester.
now let thy friendly hand
put [[strength]] enough to’t.

 [_edgar interposes._]

oswald.
wherefore, bold peasant,
dar’st thou support a publish’d traitor? hence;
lest that th’infection of his [[fortune]] take
like hold on thee. let go his arm.

edgar.
chill not let go, zir, without vurther ’casion.

oswald.
let go, [[slave]], or thou diest!

edgar.
good gentleman, go your gait, and let [[poor]] volke pass. an chud ha’
bin zwaggered out of my [[life]], ’twould not ha’ bin zo long
as ’tis by a vortnight. nay, come not near th’old [[man]]; keep
out, che vor ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be the
harder: chill be plain with you.

oswald.
out, dunghill!

edgar.
chill pick your teeth, zir. come! no matter vor your foins.

 [_they [[fight]], and edgar knocks him down._]

oswald.
slave, thou hast slain me. villain, take my purse.
if ever thou wilt thrive, bury my [[body]];
and give the letters which thou find’st about me
to edmund, earl of gloucester. seek him out
upon the british party. o, untimely death!

 [_dies._]

edgar.
i [[know]] thee well. a serviceable villain,
as duteous to the vices [[vice]] of thy mistress
as badness would [[desire]].

gloucester.
what, is he [[dead]]?

edgar.
sit you down, [[father]]; rest you.
let’s see these pockets; the letters that he speaks of
may be my [[friends]]. he’s [[dead]]; i am only sorry
he had no other deathsman. let us see:
leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.
to [[know]] our enemies’ minds [[mind]], we rip their hearts [[heart]],
their papers is more lawful.
[_reads._] ‘let our reciprocal vows be remembered. you have many
opportunities to cut him off: if your will want not, [[time]] and place
will be fruitfully offered. there is nothing done if he return the
conqueror: then am i the [[prisoner]], and his bed my gaol; from the
loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the place for your
labour. ‘your (wife, so i would say) affectionate servant, ‘goneril.’
o indistinguish’d space of woman’s will!
a plot upon her [[virtuous]] husband’s [[life]],
and the exchange my brother! here in the sands
thee i’ll rake up, the post unsanctified
of murderous lechers: and in the mature [[time]],
with this ungracious paper strike the sight
of the death-practis’d duke: for him ’tis well
that of thy [[death]] and [[business]] i can tell.

 [_exit edgar, dragging out the [[body]]._]

gloucester.
the [[king]] is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,
that i stand up, and have ingenious feeling
of my huge sorrows! [[better]] i were distract:
so should my thoughts [[thought]] be sever’d from my griefs,
and woes by [[wrong]] imaginations [[imagination]] lose
the [[knowledge]] of themselves.

 [_a drum afar off._]

edgar.
give me your hand.
far off methinks i hear the beaten drum.
come, [[father]], i’ll bestow you with a friend.

 [_exeunt._]

scene vii. a tent in the french camp.

lear on a bed, asleep, soft
music playing; physician, gentleman and others
attending.

 enter cordelia and kent.

cordelia.
o thou [[good]] kent, how shall i [[live]] and work
to match thy goodness? my [[life]] will be too short,
and every measure fail me.

kent.
to be acknowledg’d, madam, is o’erpaid.
all my reports go with the modest [[truth]];
nor more, nor clipp’d, but so.

cordelia.
be [[better]] suited,
these weeds are memories of those worser hours:
i prythee put them off.

kent.
pardon, dear madam;
yet to be known shortens my made intent.
my boon i make it that you [[know]] me not
till [[time]] and i [[think]] meet.

cordelia.
then be’t so, my [[good]] [[lord]]. [_to the physician._] how, does the
king?

physician.
madam, sleeps still.

cordelia.
o you [[kind]] gods,
cure this [[great]] breach in his abused nature!
the untun’d and jarring senses, o, wind up
of this child-changed [[father]].

physician.
so please your majesty
that we may wake the [[king]]: he hath slept long.

cordelia.
be govern’d by your [[knowledge]], and proceed
i’ the sway of your own will. is he array’d?

physician.
ay, madam. in the heaviness of sleep
we put fresh garments on him.
be by, [[good]] madam, when we do awake him;
i [[doubt]] not of his temperance.

cordelia.
very well.

physician.
please you draw near. louder the [[music]] there!

cordelia.
o my dear father! restoration hang
thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
repair those [[violent]] harms that my two sisters
have in thy reverence made!

kent.
kind and dear princess!

cordelia.
had you not been their [[father]], these [[white]] flakes
did challenge [[pity]] of them. was this a face
to be oppos’d against the warring winds?
to stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
in the most terrible and nimble stroke
of quick cross lightning? to watch, [[poor]] perdu!
with this thin helm? mine enemy’s dog,
though he had bit me, should have stood that night
against my [[fire]]; and wast thou fain, [[poor]] [[father]],
to hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn
in short and musty straw? alack, alack!
’tis wonder that thy [[life]] and wits at once
had not concluded all. he wakes; speak to him.

physician.
madam, do you; ’tis fittest.

cordelia.
how does my [[royal]] [[lord]]? how fares your majesty?

lear.
you do me [[wrong]] to take me out o’ the grave.
thou art [[arts]] a [[soul]] in bliss; but i am bound
upon a wheel of [[fire]], that mine own tears
do scald like molten lead.

cordelia.
sir, do you [[know]] me?

lear.
you are a spirit, i [[know]]: when did you [[die]]?

cordelia.
still, still, far wide!

physician.
he’s scarce awake: let him alone awhile.

lear.
where have i been? where am i? [[fair]] daylight?
i am mightily abus’d. i should e’en [[die]] with [[pity]],
to see another thus. i [[know]] not what to say.
i will not swear these are my hands: let’s see;
i [[feel]] this pin prick. would i were assur’d
of my condition!

cordelia.
o, look upon me, sir,
and hold your hands in benediction o’er me.
no, sir, you must not kneel.

lear.
pray, do not mock me:
i am a very foolish fond old [[man]],
fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
and to deal plainly,
i [[fear]] i am not in my [[perfect]] [[mind]].
methinks i should [[know]] you, and [[know]] this [[man]];
yet i am doubtful: for i am mainly ignorant
what place this is; and all the [[skill]] i have
remembers not these garments; nor i [[know]] not
where i did lodge [[last]] night. do not laugh at me;
for, as i am a [[man]], i [[think]] this lady
to be my child cordelia.

cordelia.
and so i am. i am.

lear.
be your tears wet? yes, [[faith]]. i [[pray]] weep not:
if you have poison for me, i will drink it.
i [[know]] you do not [[love]] me; for your sisters
have, as i do [[remember]], done me [[wrong]].
you have some cause, they have not.

cordelia.
no cause, no cause.

lear.
am i in [[france]]?

kent.
in your own [[kingdom]], sir.

lear.
do not [[abuse]] me.

physician.
be comforted, [[good]] madam, the [[great]] rage,
you see, is kill’d in him: and yet it is danger
to make him even o’er the [[time]] he has lost.
desire him to go in; trouble him no more
till further settling.

cordelia.
will’t please your highness walk?

lear.
you must bear with me:
pray you now, forget and [[forgive]]: i am old and foolish.

 [_exeunt lear, cordelia, physician and attendants._]

gentleman.
holds it true, sir, that the duke of cornwall was so slain?

kent.
most [[certain]], sir.

gentleman.
who is conductor of his [[people]]?

kent.
as ’tis said, the bastard [[son]] of gloucester.

gentleman.
they say edgar, his [[banished]] [[son]], is with the earl of kent
in germany.

kent.
report is changeable. ’tis [[time]] to look about; the powers [[power]] of
the [[kingdom]] approach apace.

gentleman.
the arbitrement is like to be bloody.
fare you well, sir.

 [_exit._]

kent.
my point and period will be throughly wrought,
or well or ill, as this day’s battle’s fought.

 [_exit._]



act v

scene i. the camp of the british forces [[force]] near dover.

 enter, with drum and colours edmund, regan, officers, soldiers and
 others.

edmund.
know of the duke if his [[last]] [[purpose]] hold,
or whether since he is advis’d by aught
to [[change]] the course, he’s full of alteration
and self-reproving, bring his constant [[pleasure]].

 [_to an officer, who goes out._]

regan.
our sister’s [[man]] is certainly miscarried.

edmund.
’tis to be doubted, madam.

regan.
now, sweet [[lord]],
you [[know]] the goodness i intend upon you:
tell me but truly, but then speak the [[truth]],
do you not [[love]] my sister?

edmund.
in honour’d [[love]].

regan.
but have you never found my brother’s way
to the forfended place?

edmund.
that [[thought]] abuses [[abuse]] you.

regan.
i am doubtful that you have been conjunct
and bosom’d with her, as far as we call hers.

edmund.
no, by mine [[honour]], madam.

regan.
i never shall endure her, dear my [[lord]],
be not familiar with her.

edmund.
fear not,
she and the duke her husband!

 enter with drum and colours albany, goneril and soldiers.

goneril.
[_aside._] i had rather lose the [[battle]] than that sister
should loosen him and me.

albany.
our very loving sister, well be-met.
sir, this i heard: the [[king]] is come to his [[daughter]],
with others whom the rigour of our state
forc’d to cry out. where i could not be honest,
i never yet was valiant. for this [[business]],
it toucheth us as [[france]] invades our [[land]],
not bolds the [[king]], with others whom i fear
most just and heavy causes make oppose.

edmund.
sir, you speak nobly.

regan.
why is this reason’d?

goneril.
combine together ’gainst the [[enemy]];
for these domestic and particular broils
are not the [[question]] here.

albany.
let’s, then, determine with the ancient of war
on our proceeding.

edmund.
i shall attend you presently at your tent.

regan.
sister, you’ll go with us?

goneril.
no.

regan.
’tis most convenient; [[pray]] you, go with us.

goneril.
[_aside_.] o, ho, i [[know]] the riddle. i will go.

 [_exeunt edmund, regan, goneril, officers, soldiers and attendants._]

 as they are going out, enter edgar disguised.

edgar.
if e’er your grace had [[speech]] with [[man]] so [[poor]],
hear me one word.

albany.
i’ll overtake you. speak.

edgar.
before you [[fight]] the [[battle]], ope this letter.
if you have [[victory]], let the trumpet sound
for him that brought it: wretched though i seem,
i can [[produce]] a champion that will prove
what is avouched there. if you miscarry,
your [[business]] of the [[world]] hath so an end,
and machination ceases. [[fortune]] [[love]] you!

albany.
stay till i have [[read]] the letter.

edgar.
i was forbid it.
when [[time]] shall serve, let but the herald cry,
and i’ll appear again.

albany.
why, fare thee well. i will o’erlook thy paper.

 [_exit edgar._]

 enter edmund.

edmund.
the enemy’s in view; draw up your powers [[power]].
here is the guess of their true [[strength]] and forces
by diligent discovery; but your haste
is now urg’d on you.

albany.
we will greet the [[time]].

 [_exit._]

edmund.
to both these sisters have i sworn my [[love]];
each [[jealous]] of the other, as the stung
are of the adder. which of them shall i take?
both? one? or neither? neither can be enjoy’d,
if both remain alive. to take the widow
exasperates, makes mad her sister goneril;
and hardly shall i carry out my side,
her husband being alive. now, then, we’ll use
his countenance for the [[battle]]; which being done,
let her who would be rid of him devise
his speedy taking off. as for the mercy
which he intends to lear and to cordelia,
the [[battle]] done, and they within our [[power]],
shall never see his pardon: for my state
stands on me to defend, not to debate.

 [_exit._]

scene ii. a field between the two camps.

 alarum within. enter with drum and colours, lear, cordelia and their
 forces [[force]], and exeunt.

 enter edgar and gloucester.

edgar.
here, [[father]], take the shadow of this tree
for your [[good]] host; [[pray]] that the [[right]] may thrive:
if ever i return to you again,
i’ll bring you comfort.

gloucester.
grace go with you, sir!

 [_exit edgar._]

 alarum and retreat within. enter edgar.

edgar.
away, old [[man]], give me thy hand, away!
king lear hath lost, he and his [[daughter]] ta’en:
give me thy hand; come on!

gloucester.
no further, sir; a [[man]] may rot even here.

edgar.
what, in ill thoughts [[thought]] again? [[men]] must endure
their going hence, even as their coming hither;
ripeness is all. come on.

gloucester.
and that’s true too.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. the british camp near dover.

 enter in [[conquest]] with drum and colours, edmund, lear and cordelia
as prisoners [[prisoner]]; officers, soldiers, &c.

edmund.
some officers take them away: [[good]] guard
until their greater pleasures [[pleasure]] first be known
that are to censure them.

cordelia.
we are not the first
who with [[best]] meaning have incurr’d the worst.
for thee, [[oppressed]] [[king]], i am cast down;
myself could else out-frown false fortune’s frown.
shall we not see these daughters [[daughter]] and these sisters?

lear.
no, no, no, no. come, let’s away to prison:
we two alone will sing like birds i’ the cage:
when thou dost ask me blessing i’ll kneel down
and ask of thee forgiveness. so we’ll [[live]],
and [[pray]], and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
at gilded butterflies, and hear [[poor]] rogues
talk of court news; and we’ll talk with them too,
who loses and who wins; who’s in, who’s out;
and take upon’s the mystery of things,
as if we were [[god’s]] spies. and we’ll wear out,
in a wall’d prison, packs and sects of [[great]] ones
that ebb and flow by the moon.

edmund.
take them away.

lear.
upon such sacrifices [[sacrifice]], my cordelia,
the gods themselves throw incense. have i caught thee?
he that parts us shall bring a brand from [[heaven]],
and [[fire]] us hence like foxes. wipe thine [[eyes]];
the [[good]] years shall devour them, flesh and fell,
ere they shall make us weep!
we’ll see ’em starve first: come.

 [_exeunt lear and cordelia, guarded._]

edmund.
come hither, captain, hark.
take thou this note [_giving a paper_]; go [[follow]] them to prison.
one step i have advanc’d thee; if thou dost
as this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
to [[noble]] fortunes [[fortune]]: [[know]] thou this, that men
are as the [[time]] is; to be tender-minded
does not become a [[sword]]. thy [[great]] employment
will not bear [[question]]; either say thou’lt do’t,
or thrive by other means.

captain.
i’ll do’t, my [[lord]].

edmund.
about it; and write [[happy]] when thou hast done.
mark, i say, instantly; and carry it so
as i have set it down.

captain.
i cannot draw a cart, nor [[eat]] dried oats;
if it be man’s [[work]], i’ll do’t.

 [_exit._]

 flourish. enter albany, goneril,
regan, officers and attendants.

albany.
sir, you have show’d today your valiant strain,
and [[fortune]] [[led]] you well: you have the captives
who were the opposites of this day’s strife:
i do require them of you, so to use them
as we shall find their merits [[merit]] and our safety
may equally determine.

edmund.
sir, i [[thought]] it fit
to send the old and miserable king
to some retention and appointed guard;
whose [[age]] has charms in it, whose title more,
to pluck the [[common]] bosom on his side,
and turn our impress’d lances in our eyes
which do command them. with him i sent the queen;
my [[reason]] all the same; and they are ready
tomorrow, or at further space, to appear
where you shall hold your session. at this time
we sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
and the [[best]] quarrels in the heat are curs’d
by those that [[feel]] their sharpness.
the [[question]] of cordelia and her father
requires a fitter place.

albany.
sir, by your patience,
i hold you but a [[subject]] of this [[war]],
not as a [[brother]].

regan.
that’s as we list to grace him.
methinks our [[pleasure]] might have been demanded
ere you had spoke so far. he [[led]] our powers [[power]];
bore the commission of my place and [[person]];
the which immediacy may well stand up
and call itself your [[brother]].

goneril.
not so hot:
in his own grace he doth exalt himself,
more than in your addition.

regan.
in my rights [[right]],
by me invested, he compeers the [[best]].

albany.
that were the most, if he should husband you.

regan.
jesters do oft prove prophets [[prophet]].

goneril.
holla, holla!
that eye that told you so look’d but asquint.

regan.
lady, i am not well; else i should answer
from a full-flowing stomach. general,
take thou my soldiers, prisoners [[prisoner]], patrimony;
dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:
witness the [[world]] that i create thee here
my [[lord]] and master.

goneril.
mean you to enjoy him?

albany.
the let-alone lies [[lie]] not in your [[good]] will.

edmund.
nor in thine, [[lord]].

albany.
half-blooded fellow, yes.

regan.
[_to edmund._] let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.

albany.
stay yet; hear [[reason]]: edmund, i arrest thee
on [[capital]] [[treason]]; and, in thine arrest,
this gilded serpent. [_pointing to goneril._]
for your claim, [[fair]] sister,
i bar it in the interest of my [[wife]];
’tis she is sub-contracted to this [[lord]],
and i her husband contradict your bans.
if you will [[marry]], make your loves [[love]] to me,
my [[lady]] is bespoke.

goneril.
an interlude!

albany.
thou art [[arts]] arm’d, gloucester. let the trumpet sound:
if none appear to prove upon thy person
thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
there is my pledge. [_throwing down a glove._]
i’ll make it on thy [[heart]],
ere i taste bread, thou art [[arts]] in nothing less
than i have here proclaim’d thee.

regan.
sick, o, sick!

goneril.
[_aside._] if not, i’ll ne’er trust medicine.

edmund.
there’s my exchange. [_throwing down a glove._]
what in the [[world]] he is
that names me traitor, villain-like he lies [[lie]].
call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,
on him, on you, who not? i will maintain
my [[truth]] and [[honour]] firmly.

albany.
a herald, ho!

 enter a herald.

trust to thy [[single]] [[virtue]]; for thy soldiers,
all levied in my name, have in my name
took their discharge.

regan.
my sickness grows upon me.

albany.
she is not well. convey her to my tent.

 [_exit regan, [[led]]._]

come hither, herald. let the trumpet sound
and [[read]] out this.

officer.
sound, trumpet!

 [_a trumpet sounds._]

herald.
[_reads._] ‘if any [[man]] of quality or [[degree]] within the lists of
the [[army]] will maintain upon edmund, supposed earl of gloucester,
that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third sound
of the trumpet. he is bold in his defence.’

edmund.
sound!

 [_first trumpet._]

herald.
again!

 [_second trumpet._]

herald.
again!

 third trumpet. trumpet answers [[answer]] within. enter edgar, armed, preceded by
 a trumpet.

albany.
ask him his purposes [[purpose]], why he appears
upon this call o’ the trumpet.

herald.
what are you?
your name, your quality? and why you answer
this [[present]] summons?

edgar.
know my name is lost;
by treason’s tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.
yet am i [[noble]] as the adversary
i come to cope.

albany.
which is that adversary?

edgar.
what’s he that speaks for edmund, earl of gloucester?

edmund.
himself, what say’st thou to him?

edgar.
draw thy [[sword]],
that if my [[speech]] offend a [[noble]] [[heart]],
thy arm may do thee [[justice]]: here is mine.
behold, it is the [[privilege]] of mine honours [[honour]],
my oath, and my profession: i [[protest]],
maugre thy [[strength]], [[youth]], place, and eminence,
despite thy victor [[sword]] and fire-new [[fortune]],
thy valour and thy [[heart]], thou art [[arts]] a traitor;
false to thy gods, thy [[brother]], and thy [[father]];
conspirant ’gainst this high illustrious [[prince]];
and, from the extremest upward of thy head
to the descent and dust beneath thy foot,
a most toad-spotted traitor. say thou ‘no,’
this [[sword]], this arm, and my [[best]] spirits are bent
to prove upon thy [[heart]], whereto i speak,
thou liest.

edmund.
in [[wisdom]] i should ask thy name;
but since thy outside looks so [[fair]] and warlike,
and that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
what safe and nicely i might well delay
by [[rule]] of knighthood, i disdain and spurn.
back do i toss those treasons to thy head,
with the hell-hated [[lie]] o’erwhelm thy [[heart]];
which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
this [[sword]] of mine shall give them instant way,
where they shall rest for ever. trumpets, speak!

 [_alarums. they [[fight]]. edmund falls._]

albany.
save him, save him!

goneril.
this is mere practice, gloucester:
by the [[law]] of arms thou wast not bound to answer
an unknown opposite; thou art [[arts]] not vanquish’d,
but cozen’d and beguil’d.

albany.
shut your mouth, dame,
or with this paper shall i stop it. hold, sir;
thou worse than any name, [[read]] thine own [[evil]].
no tearing, [[lady]]; i perceive you [[know]] it.

 [_gives the letter to edmund._]

goneril.
say if i do, the laws [[law]] are mine, not thine:
who can arraign me for’t?

 [_exit._]

albany.
most monstrous! o!
know’st thou this paper?

edmund.
ask me not what i [[know]].

albany.
[_to an officer, who goes out._] go after her; she’s desperate;
govern her.

edmund.
what you have charg’d me with, that have i done;
and more, much more; the [[time]] will bring it out.
’tis [[past]], and so am i. but what art [[arts]] thou
that hast this [[fortune]] on me? if thou’rt [[noble]],
i do [[forgive]] thee.

edgar.
let’s exchange charity.
i am no less in [[blood]] than thou art [[arts]], edmund;
if more, the more thou hast wrong’d me.
my name is edgar and thy father’s [[son]].
the gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
make instruments to plague us:
the dark and vicious place where thee he got
cost him his [[eyes]].

edmund.
thou hast spoken [[right]], ’tis true;
the wheel is come full circle; i am here.

albany.
methought thy very gait did prophesy
a [[royal]] nobleness. i must embrace thee.
let [[sorrow]] split my [[heart]] if ever i
did hate thee or thy [[father]].

edgar.
worthy [[prince]], i know’t.

albany.
where have you hid yourself?
how have you known the miseries of your [[father]]?

edgar.
by nursing them, my [[lord]]. list a brief tale;
and when ’tis told, o that my [[heart]] would burst!
the bloody proclamation to escape
that follow’d me so near,—o, our lives’ sweetness!
that with the [[pain]] of [[death]] we’d hourly die
rather than [[die]] at once!—taught me to shift
into a madman’s rags; t’assume a semblance
that very dogs disdain’d; and in this habit
met i my [[father]] with his bleeding rings,
their precious stones new lost; became his guide,
led him, begg’d for him, sav’d him from despair;
never,—o fault!—reveal’d myself unto him
until some half hour [[past]], when i was arm’d;
not sure, though hoping of this [[good]] [[success]],
i ask’d his blessing, and from first to last
told him my pilgrimage. but his flaw’d [[heart]],
alack, too [[weak]] the conflict to support!
’twixt two extremes of passion, joy and [[grief]],
burst smilingly.

edmund.
this [[speech]] of yours hath mov’d me,
and shall perchance do [[good]], but speak you on;
you look as you had something more to say.

albany.
if there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
for i am almost ready to dissolve,
hearing of this.

edgar.
this would have seem’d a period
to such as [[love]] not [[sorrow]]; but another,
to amplify too much, would make much more,
and top extremity.
whilst i was big in clamour, came there a man
who, having seen me in my worst estate,
shunn’d my abhorr’d [[society]]; but then finding
who ’twas that so endur’d, with his [[strong]] arms
he fastened on my neck, and bellow’d out
as he’d burst [[heaven]]; threw him on my [[father]];
told the most piteous tale of lear and him
that ever ear receiv’d, which in recounting
his [[grief]] grew puissant, and the strings of life
began to crack. twice then the trumpets sounded,
and there i left him tranc’d.

albany.
but who was this?

edgar.
kent, sir, the banish’d kent; who in disguise
follow’d his [[enemy]] [[king]] and did him service
improper for a [[slave]].

 enter a gentleman hastily,
with a bloody knife.

gentleman.
help, help! o, help!

edgar.
what [[kind]] of [[help]]?

albany.
speak, [[man]].

edgar.
what means this bloody knife?

gentleman.
’tis hot, it smokes;
it came even from the [[heart]] of—o! she’s dead!

albany.
who [[dead]]? speak, [[man]].

gentleman.
your [[lady]], sir, your [[lady]]; and her sister
by her is poisoned; she hath confesses it.

edmund.
i was contracted to them both, all three
now [[marry]] in an instant.

edgar.
here comes kent.

 enter kent.

albany.
produce their bodies [[body]], be they alive or [[dead]].
this judgement of the heavens [[heaven]] that makes us tremble
touches us not with [[pity]]. o, is this he?
the [[time]] will not allow the compliment
which very manners urges.

kent.
i am come
to bid my [[king]] and master aye [[good]] night:
is he not here?

albany.
great thing of us forgot!
speak, edmund, where’s the [[king]]? and where’s cordelia?

 the bodies [[body]] of goneril and
regan are brought in.

seest thou this object, kent?

kent.
alack, why thus?

edmund.
yet edmund was belov’d.
the one the other poisoned for my sake,
and after slew herself.

albany.
even so. cover their faces.

edmund.
i pant for [[life]]. some [[good]] i mean to do,
despite of mine own [[nature]]. quickly send,
be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
is on the [[life]] of lear and on cordelia;
nay, send in [[time]].

albany.
run, run, o, run!

edgar.
to who, my [[lord]]? who has the office? send
thy token of reprieve.

edmund.
well [[thought]] on: take my [[sword]],
give it the captain.

edgar.
haste thee for thy [[life]].

 [_exit edgar._]

edmund.
he hath commission from thy [[wife]] and me
to hang cordelia in the prison, and
to lay the blame upon her own despair,
that she fordid herself.

albany.
the gods defend her! bear him hence awhile.

 [_edmund is borne off._]

 enter lear with cordelia [[dead]] in his arms; edgar,
officer and others following.

lear.
howl, howl, howl, howl! o, you are [[men]] of stone.
had i your tongues and [[eyes]], i’ld use them so
that heaven’s vault should crack. she’s gone for ever!
i [[know]] when one is [[dead]], and when one lives [[life]];
she’s [[dead]] as [[earth]]. lend me a looking glass;
if that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
why, then she lives [[life]].

kent.
is this the promis’d end?

edgar.
or image of that [[horror]]?

albany.
fall, and cease!

lear.
this feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
it is a [[chance]] which does redeem all sorrows
that ever i have [[felt]].

kent.
o, my [[good]] master! [_kneeling._]

lear.
prythee, away!

edgar.
’tis [[noble]] kent, your friend.

lear.
a plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
i might have sav’d her; now she’s gone for ever!
cordelia, cordelia! stay a little. ha!
what is’t thou say’st? her voice was ever soft,
gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
i kill’d the [[slave]] that was a-hanging thee.

officer.
’tis true, my lords [[lord]], he did.

lear.
did i not, fellow?
i have seen the day, with my [[good]] biting falchion
i would have made them skip. i am old now,
and these same crosses spoil me. who are you?
mine [[eyes]] are not o’ the [[best]], i’ll tell you straight.

kent.
if [[fortune]] brag of two she lov’d and hated,
one of them we behold.

lear.
this is a dull sight. are you not kent?

kent.
the same,
your servant kent. where is your servant caius?

lear.
he’s a [[good]] fellow, i can tell you that;
he’ll strike, and quickly too:. he’s [[dead]] and rotten.

kent.
no, my [[good]] [[lord]]; i am the very [[man]].

lear.
i’ll see that straight.

kent.
that from your first of difference and decay
have follow’d your [[sad]] steps.

lear.
you are welcome hither.

kent.
nor no [[man]] else. all’s cheerless, dark and deadly.
your eldest daughters [[daughter]] have fordone themselves,
and desperately are [[dead]].

lear.
ay, so i [[think]].

albany.
he knows [[know]] not what he says; and [[vain]] is it
that we [[present]] us to him.

edgar.
very bootless.

 enter an officer.

officer.
edmund is [[dead]], my [[lord]].

albany.
that’s but a trifle here.
you lords [[lord]] and [[noble]] [[friends]], [[know]] our intent.
what comfort to this [[great]] decay may come
shall be applied for us, we will resign,
during the [[life]] of this old majesty,
to him our absolute [[power]];
[_to edgar and kent_] you to your rights [[right]];
with boot and such addition as your honours
have more than merited. all [[friends]] shall taste
the wages of their [[virtue]] and all foes
the cup of their deservings. o, see, see!

lear.
and my [[poor]] [[fool]] is hang’d! no, no, no life!
why should a dog, a horse, a rat have [[life]],
and thou no breath at all? thou’lt come no more,
never, never, never, never, never!
pray you undo this button. thank you, sir.
do you see this? look on her: look, her lips,
look there, look there!

 [_he dies._]

edgar.
he faints! my [[lord]], my lord!

kent.
break, [[heart]]; i prythee break!

edgar.
look up, my [[lord]].

kent.
vex not his ghost: o, let him pass! he hates him
that would upon the rack of this rough world
stretch him out longer.

edgar.
he is gone indeed.

kent.
the wonder is, he hath endur’d so long:
he but usurp’d his [[life]].

albany.
bear them from hence. our [[present]] business
is general woe. [_to edgar and kent._] [[friends]] of my [[soul]], you twain,
rule in this realm and the gor’d [[state]] sustain.

kent.
i have a [[journey]], sir, shortly to go;
my master calls me, i must not say no.

edgar.
the weight of this [[sad]] [[time]] we must obey;
speak what we [[feel]], not what we ought to say.
the oldest hath borne most; we that are young
shall never see so much, nor [[live]] so long.

 [_exeunt with a [[dead]] march._]
