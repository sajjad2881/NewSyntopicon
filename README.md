## Background 

In 1952, after nearly 400,000 hours of reading, Mortimer Adler published **The Syntopicon**. It was meant to be a reference book that indexed the world's great ideas.

>"The aim of this "syntopical reading" was to discover the unity and continuity of Western thought in the discussion of common themes and problems from one end of the tradition to the other. All the works in the Great Books are significantly related to one another and, taken together, they adequately present the ideas and issues, the terms and topics, that have made the Western tradition what it is. More than a collection of books, then, the Great Books are a certain kind of whole that can and should be read as such." - Mortimer Adler

Our literary heritage is, in an essence, a "Great Conversation" -- the ongoing process of writers and thinkers referencing, building on, and refining the work of their predecessors. Since the time of Homer, authors have wrestled with the same fundamental, existential ideas, themes and questions. The Syntopicon aims to trace that. It traces the conversations that have defined our civilization, connecting and troubling people in every age. And it gives us an opportunity to read these conversations and then participate in and contribute to them.

## Purpose

This project does something similar to the original Syntopicon. It takes the great books and then puts their most influential ideas in backlinks. **Each idea is a node in the graph, and also has an index of every single instance where the idea has been mentioned.** In this way, you can see how different ideas are connected together and how they *develop and evolve* overtime. It combines the power and flexibility of knowledge graphs with our best ideas to create a better reading experience for you, so that you can satisfy your curiosity and explore the ideas that have shaped us civilization in a **fast and seamless manner**.

## Usage

Here is the graph you will be able to explore and play with. Each idea is a node in the graph, and the lines in between the nodes show how the different ideas are connected to each other.

Suppose you are reading *"What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?"* and are really fascinated by the idea of **hope**. You can click on the word and see a list of all other mentions of hope to explore how other authors examine the idea.

You can do so for any of the ideas in backlinks. Here, suppose you wanted to explore the influence of Homer in Western literature. Clicking on his name generates a list of every instance he is mentioned

If you want to explore a reference further, you can simply click on it and you will be taken to that instance, as shown here.

## Setup

> Note: If you just want to read, the books are hosted on this website. Unfortunately, the graph and linked mentions cannot be supported online yet. To access those, you will have to run Obsidian locally. 

1. Download the [Obsidian App](https://obsidian.md)
2. Download the [folder linked here](https://github.com/sajjad2881/NewSyntopicon/releases/latest/download/NewSyntopicon.zip)
3. Open the Obsidian vault on the downloaded folder 
4. You're done!! Happy exploring

Note: To optimise the graph, you can decrease node size and line thickness in the graph settings
